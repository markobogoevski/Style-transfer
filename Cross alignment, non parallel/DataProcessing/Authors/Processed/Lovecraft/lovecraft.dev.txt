he admitted , moreover , that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea ; having been hailed when quite close to it , but never seen again .
that night the moon was very bright , and one could see a great way down in the water .
there was so little wind that the ship could not move much , and the ocean was very calm .
looking over the rail carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of the great temple , and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square .
dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins , and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there , sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea .
as the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills , and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the walls of myriad little houses .
then the suburbs appeared , and finally a great lone building on a hill , of simpler architecture than the other structures , and in much better repair .
it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square , with a tower at each corner , a paved court in the centre , and small curious round windows all over it .
probably it was of basalt , though weeds draped the greater part ; and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery .
some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining , and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears .
then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court , and saw that something was tied to it .
and when after getting a telescope from the captain cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab , head downward and without any eyes , he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea .
the next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar , in the land of forgotten dreams , with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo .
and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and in the distance .
oriab is a very great isle , and its port of baharna a mighty city .
the wharves of baharna are of porphyry , and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them , having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings .
there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath , on whose farther shore are the vast ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered .
as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome , and in all the million windows of baharna terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk , till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour .
the captain , after landing , made carter a guest in his own small house on the shores of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it ; and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the traveller delight .
and in the days after that carter asked for rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places where and meet , but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face .
ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it , and besides , one could never depend on the certainty that are altogether fabulous .
when the captain sailed hack to carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town , which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yath farther shore .
here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek , and correlated all that he had learned from the about the roads thither .
the keeper of the tavern was a very old man , and had heard so many legends that he was a great help .
he even took carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit ngranek higher slopes .
the old had heard from his great grandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and seen the carven face , here drawing it for others to behold , but carter had very great doubts , since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless , and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste , with horns and wings and claws and curling tails .
at last , having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of baharna , carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by yath shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony ngranek .
on his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses , and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the skai .
by evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on yath farther shore , and though old had warned him not to camp there at night , he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher .
around him he wrapped another blanket , for the nights are cold in oriab ; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin groves .
the sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath , and carter looked about for his tethered zebra .
great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied , and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead , with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat .
his pack had been disturbed , and several shiny knickknacks taken away , and all round on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account .
the legends and warnings of occurred to him , and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night .
then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward ngranek , though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple , with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peer .
his course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country , and he saw only the huts of and the camp of those who gathered resin from the groves .
the whole air was fragrant with balsam , and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun .
near sunset he came on a new camp of lava gatherers returning with laden sacks from ngranek lower slopes ; and here he also camped , listening to the songs and tales of the men , and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost .
he had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him , and at nightfall did not return to his fellows .
when they looked for him the next day they found only his turban , nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen .
they did not search any more , because the old man among them said it would be of no use .
no one ever found what the took , though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous .
carter asked them if sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints , but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry .
when he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more , but went to sleep in his blanket .
the next day he rose with the and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them .
their older men gave him blessings and warnings , and told him he had better not climb too high on ngranek , but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded .
for still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown kadath ; and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset .
by noon , after a long uphill ride , he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the who had once dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava .
here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeeper grandfather , but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked .
their homes had crept even up the mountain slope , and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose .
at last they decided it would be better to leave altogether , since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably ; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in baharna , inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of which to this day they carry on .
it was from these children of the exiled that carter had heard the best tales about ngranek when searching through baharna ancient taverns .
all this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and higher as carter approached it .
there were sparse trees on the lower slopes and feeble shrubs above them , and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky , to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow .
carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone , and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it .
in places there were solid streams of lava , and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges .
ninety aeons ago , before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak , that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders .
now it towered all silent and sinister , bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told .
and there were caves in that mountain , which might be empty and alone with elder darkness , or might if legend spoke truly hold horrors of a form not to be surmised .
the ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek , thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees , and strewn with bits of rock , lava , and ancient cinder .
there were the charred embers of many camps , where the were wont to stop , and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in ngranek high passes and labyrinthine caves .
at evening carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night , tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blankets before going to sleep .
and all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool , but carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror , since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slope of ngranek .
in the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent , taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go , but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep .
thereafter he scrambled up alone ; first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings , and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there .
he regretted coming clear of the trees , since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying .
at length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked about ; the deserted huts of the , the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them , the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing , and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten .
he found it best not to look around , and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling to .
then the soil became meagre , with great patches of bare rock cropping out , and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice .
finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock , and had it not been very rough and weathered , he could scarcely have ascended farther .
knobs , ledges , and pinnacles , however , helped greatly ; and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some scratched clumsily in the friable stone , and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him .
after a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed , and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found .
in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent .
once or twice carter dared to look around , and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below .
all the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight , with baharna stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance .
and beyond that the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secrets .
thus far there had been much winding around the mountain , so that the farther and carven side was still hidden .
carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished , and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous .
after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no , but that it led steeply on in an arc which would , unless suddenly interrupted or deflected , bring him after a few hours ' climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava .
as new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed .
the mountain side , too , was somewhat different ; being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left .
some of these were above him and some beneath him , all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man .
the air was very cold now , but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it .
only the increasing rarity bothered him , and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths .
he was not much impressed by travellers ' tales , but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble .
all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown kadath .
at last , in the fearsome iciness of upper space , he came round fully to the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of the great ones .
there was unfolded , too , a vast expanse of country to the south ; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys , and seemed to have no ending .
no trace of the sea was visible on this side , for oriab is a great island .
black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs , but none of them was accessible to a climber .
there now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view , and carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable .
poised in windy insecurity miles above earth , with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other , he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun ngranek hidden side .
he could not turn round , yet the sun was already low .
if there were no way aloft , the night would find him crouching there still , and the dawn would not find him at all .
but there was a way , and he saw it in due season .
only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds , yet to carter they were sufficient .
surmounting now the rock , he found the slope above much easier than that below , since a great glacier melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges .
to the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths , with a cave dark mouth just out of reach above him .
elsewhere , however , the mountain slanted back strongly , and even gave him space to lean and rest .
he felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line , and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight .
surely enough , there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above , and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed ; hanging there forever in bold outline .
and when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud , and clutched at the jagged rock in awe ; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth dawn had shaped it , but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god .
stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire .
how vast it was no mind can ever measure , but carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it .
it was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods , and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker .
rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken , and carter saw that it was indeed so ; for those long narrow eyes and ears , and that thin nose and pointed chin , all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods .
he clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie , even though it was this which he had expected and come to find ; for there is in a god face more of marvel than prediction can tell , and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the scyptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old , the marvel is so strong that none may escape it .
here , too , was the added marvel of recognition ; for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the god children , he now knew that he need not do so .
certainly , the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort , but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport celephais which lies in beyond the tanarian hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in waking life .
every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais , and it was clear that these could be no others than the he sought .
where they dwelt , there must the cold waste lie close , and within it unknown kadath and its onyx castle for the great ones .
so to celephais he must go , far distant from the isle of oriab , and in such parts as would take him back to and up the skai to the bridge by nir , and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs , whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of thran , where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenarian sea .
but dusk was now thick , and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow .
perched on that ledge night found the seeker ; and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up , but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came , praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley .
the stars came out , but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes ; nothingness leagued with death , against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink .
the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him , and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach .
suddenly , without a warning sound in the dark , carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand .
then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below .
and between him and the milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and .
other things , too , had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him , as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice .
then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet , and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space .
another minute and the stars were gone , and carter knew that the had got him .
they bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond .
when he struggled , as at first he did by instinct , they tickled him with deliberation .
they made no sound at all themselves , and even their membranous wings were silent .
they were frightfully cold and damp and slippery , and their paws kneaded one detestably .
soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling , giddying , sickening rush of dank , air ; and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness .
he screamed again and again , but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety .
then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about , and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell , and which is litten only by the pale death fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earth core .
at last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled peaks of throk .
awful and sinister they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths ; higher than man may reckon , and guarding terrible valleys where the dholes crawl and burrow nastily .
but carter preferred to look at them than at his captors , which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with smooth , oily , surfaces , unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other , bat wings whose beating made no sound , ugly prehensile paws , and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly .
and worst of all , they never spoke or laughed , and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with , but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be .
all they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle ; that was the way of .
as the band flew lower the peaks of throk rose grey and towering on all sides , and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impressive granite of the endless twilight .
at still lower levels the in the air gave out , and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out .
soon the peaks were very far away , and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them .
then in the end the landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones , and left carter all alone in that black valley .
to bring him thither was the duty of the that guard ngranek ; and this done , they flapped away silently .
when carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not , since even the peaks of throk had faded out of sight .
there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bones .
now carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnoth , where crawl and burrow the enormous dholes ; but he did not know what to expect , because no one has ever seen a dhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like .
dholes are known only by dim rumour , from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one .
they can not be seen because they creep only in the dark .
carter did not wish to meet a dhole , so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him .
even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective , for whispers of pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days .
in brief , it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings ; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than throk peaks which marks the edge of their domain .
showers of bones would tell him where to look , and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder ; for strange to say , he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures .
a man he had known in boston a painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard had actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering .
this man had vanished at last , and carter was not sure but that he might find him now , and use for the first time in dreamland that english of his dim waking life .
in any case , he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of pnoth ; and it would be better to meet a ghoul , which one can see , than a dhole , which one can not see .
so carter walked in the dark , and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot .
once he bumped into a stony slope , and knew it must be the base of one of throk peaks .
then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air , and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls .
he was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below , but realised that the inner world has strange laws .
as he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull , and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul .
sound travels slowly , so it was some time before he heard an answering glibber .
but it came at last , and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered .
the wait for this was very tense , since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting .
indeed , it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off .
as this thoughtfully approached , he became more and more uncomfortable ; for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come .
finally the tension grew almost unbearable , and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound .
it was the ladder , and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands .
but the other sound did not cease , and followed him even as he climbed .
he had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic , and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below .
at a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling ; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed dhole whose form no man might see .
for hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands , seeing again the grey and throk uncomfortable pinnacles .
at last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls , whose vertical side he could not glimpse ; and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of notre dame .
this almost made him lose his hold through faintness , but a moment later he was himself again ; for his vanished friend richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul , and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies .
so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag , and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously .
he was now on a plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows .
the ghouls were in general respectful , even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively .
through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend , and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world .
a greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickman present habitation , so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould .
they emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earth old gravestones , broken urns , and grotesque fragments of monuments and carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumber .
there , on a tombstone of stolen from the granary burying ground in boston , sat a ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman .
it was naked and rubbery , and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure .
but it still remembered a little english , and was able to converse with carter in grunts and monosyllables , helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls .
when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city celephais in beyond the tanarian hills , it seemed rather doubtful ; for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland ( leaving that to the wamps that are spawned in dead cities ) , and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood , including the terrible kingdom of the gugs .
the gugs , hairy and gigantic , once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earth gods and they were banished to caverns below .
only a great trap door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the with the enchanted wood , and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse .
that a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable ; for mortal dreamers were their former food , and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts , those repulsive beings which die in the light , and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroos .
so the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss at sarkomand , that deserted city in the valley below leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs , or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood .
this , however , did not suit the seeker ; for he knew nothing of the way from leng to , and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream .
it was disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in celephais , and who , being the sons of gods , must point the way to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwell .
after much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs ' kingdom .
there was one chance that carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors , and reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it , which has the stairs leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood .
pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door ; for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid , and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see them feasting there .
he also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself ; shaving the beard he had allowed to grow ( for ghouls have none ) , wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface , and loping in the usual slumping way , with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb .
they would reach the city of gugs which is coterminous with the whole kingdom through the proper burrows , emerging in a cemetery not far from the tower of koth .
they must beware , however , of a large cave near the cemetery ; for this is the mouth of the vaults of zin , and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them .
the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs , for they can not discriminate .
they are very primitive , and eat one another .
the gugs have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of zin , but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts .
though ghasts can not live in real light , they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours .
so at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of nepemiah derby , obit , from the charter street burying ground in salem .
when they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs .
on the right of the hole out of which they wriggled , and seen through aisles of monoliths , was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth .
this was the great city of the gugs , whose doorways are thirty feet high .
ghouls come here often , for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year , and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men .
carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of pnoth .
straight ahead , and just outside the cemetery , rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned .
this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible , since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness .
and truly , that warning was soon well justified ; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs ' resting had been rightly timed , there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern mouth first one pair of eyes and then another , implying that the gugs were one sentry less , and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell .
so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent .
it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices , and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw , since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults .
after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight , and carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast , whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose , a forehead , and other important particulars .
presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow , and a ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of was a bad sign .
it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all , but had merely slipped past him as he slept , so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim .
it was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen , grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose , but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts .
and yet , horrible as they were , they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness .
it was a paw , fully two feet and a half across , and equipped with formidable talons .
after it came another paw , and after that a great arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms .
then two pink eyes shone , and the head of the awakened gug sentry , large as a barrel , wabbled into view .
the eyes jutted two inches from each side , shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs .
but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth .
that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head , opening vertically instead of horizontally .
but before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet , the vindictive ghasts were upon him .
carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin , till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression .
the battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one .
from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug , nipping and tearing with their muzzles , and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves .
all the time they coughed excitedly , screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number , so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern .
as it was , the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness , with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance .
then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance , and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight .
silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement , hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs .
apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour , the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace ; but even so the journey was no brief one , for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale .
at last , however , they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest ; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in which made one shudder without knowing its meaning .
this was the central tower with the sign of koth , and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood .
there now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps , which were fashioned for gugs , and were therefore nearly a yard high .
of their number carter could form no just estimate , for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him .
all through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit ; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the great one curse , there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps , and escaped ghasts are often chased , even to the very top .
so sharp are the ears of gugs , that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke ; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants , accustomed from their in the vaults of zin to seeing without light , to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those cyclopean steps .
it was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all , but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers .
nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs .
there was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts , which frequently hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs .
if the gugs slept long , and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern , the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and things ; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug .
then , after aeons of climbing , there came a cough from the darkness above ; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn .
it was clear that a ghast , or perhaps even more , had strayed into that tower before the coming of carter and his guides ; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close .
after a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the best possible way , with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight .
ghouls can see in the dark , so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been alone .
in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast , and the ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow .
presently two eyes flashed into view , and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering .
as it hopped down to the step above the ghouls , they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force , so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap .
there seemed to be only this one animal , and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again .
as before , they were obliged to aid him ; and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghast uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blackness .
at last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt ; and feeling above him , carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at last .
to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of , but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop , and permit carter to escape through the crack .
they themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs , since their elusiveness was great , and they did not know the way overland to spectral sarkomand with its gate to the abyss .
mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them , and carter helped push with as much strength as he had .
they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one , and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles .
after a few moments a crack of light appeared ; and carter , to whom that task had been entrusted , slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture .
there now ensued a mighty heaving ; but progress was very slow , and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open .
suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on the steps below them .
it was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels ; but of all the possible causes of that body dislodgement and rolling , none was in the least reassuring .
therefore , knowing the ways of gugs , the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy ; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst carter turned the slab and left a generous opening .
they now helped carter through , letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside .
another second and they were through themselves , knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap door while a panting became audible beneath .
because of the great one curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal , so with a deep relief and sense of repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest .
weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago , it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now left behind .
there was no living denizen about , for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course .
to return through the tower they no longer dared , and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests nasht and in the cavern of flame .
so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its gate of the abyss , though of how to get there they knew nothing .
carter recalled that it lies in the valley below leng , and recalled likewise that he had seen in a sinister , old merchant reputed to trade on leng , therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out , crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the river to its mouth .
this they at once resolved to do , and lost no time in loping off , since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel .
and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts , thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was pickman ; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left .
for a ghoul is a ghoul , and at best an unpleasant companion for man .
after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth , thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carried .
it was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees , but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day ; wherefore carter set out upon the route toward celephais , in beyond the tanarian hills .
and as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an on ngranek in oriab so many aeons ago , and wondered if any had fed and released it .
and he wondered , too , if he would ever return to baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by yath shore , and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him .
such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland .
but presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree .
he had avoided the great circle of stones , since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now ; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere .
upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion ; and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern .
for a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs .
it all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar , and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions .
the matter had long rankled ; and now , or at least within a month , the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks , taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares , and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise .
this was the plan of the zoogs , and carter saw that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest .
very quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields .
and a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small , black , grey , tiger , white , yellow , and mixed , and it echoed through nir and beyond the skai even into ulthar , and ulthar numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march .
it was fortunate that the moon was not up , so that all the cats were on earth .
swiftly and silently leaping , they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood .
carter was there to greet them , and the sight of shapely , wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss .
he was glad to see his venerable friend and rescuer at the head of ulthar detachment , a collar of rank around his sleek neck , and whiskers bristling at a martial angle .
better still , as a in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that morning in ulthar .
he was a strapping and promising cat now , and purred as he shook hands with his friend .
his grandfather said he was doing very well in the army , and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign .
carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe , and was rewarded by purrs of gratitude from all sides .
consulting with the generals , he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs ; forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilization of their army of invasion .
thereupon without a moment loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle .
flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs .
they saw that they were beaten in advance , and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present .
half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the centre , leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood .
terms were discussed at length , carter acting as interpreter , and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse , quail , and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the forest .
twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the temple of cats at ulthar , and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs .
these matters disposed of , the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes , which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance .
the old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach , deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise .
this offer he welcomed with gratitude ; not only for the safety it afforded , but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats .
so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment , relaxed after the successful performance of its duty , randolph carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees , talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of that primeval floor .
and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in the cold waste , but did not know where it was .
as for the marvellous sunset city , he had not even heard of that , but would gladly relay to carter anything he might later learn .
he gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland , and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in celephais , whither he was bound .
that old cat , already slightly known to carter , was a dignified maltese ; and would prove highly influential in any transaction .
it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood , and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell .
the young he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it , but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army .
so carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a river , and the cats went back into the wood .
well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood of the cerenerian sea , and blithely did he follow the singing river oukianos that marked his course .
the sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn , and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dangle .
a blessed haze lies upon all this region , wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold , and a little more of the summer humming music of birds and bees ; so that men walk through it as through a faery place , and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember .
by noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to the river edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukianos , who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks .
all of jasper is that temple , and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts , its seven pinnacled towers , and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night .
many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles , but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests , none but the king of ilek vad may say ; for only he had entered the temple or seen the priests .
now , in the drowsiness of day , that carven and delicate fane was silent , and carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under the enchanted sun .
all that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl .
sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukianos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream , and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side , whose trees came down clear to the water edge .
in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink , but now he could not glimpse any .
once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird , which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the sun , and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it .
toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran .
lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city , sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows , for they are more ancient than memory .
yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets , the clustered towers within , all white beneath their golden spires , are loftier still ; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky , sometimes shining clear , sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist , and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours .
and where thran gates open on the river are great wharves of marble , with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor , and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places .
landward beyond the walls lies the farm country , where small white cottages dream between little hills , and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens .
down through this verdant land carter walked at evening , and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of thran .
and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate , and was stopped by a sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief , and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thran steep mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold .
then into that incredible city he walked ; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel , and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers .
lights shone through grated and balconied windows , and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled .
carter knew his way , and edged down through darker streets to the river , where at an old sea tavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams .
there he bought his passage to celephais on a great green galleon , and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn , who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods .
in the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephais , and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the cerenerian sea begun .
for many leagues the banks were much as they were above thran , with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right , and a drowsy village on the shore , with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun .
mindful of his search , carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of celephais , asking the names and ways of the strange men with long , narrow eyes , ears , thin noses , and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais .
of these men the sailors knew not much , save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about them .
their land , very far away , was called inquanok , and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land , and said to be close to unpleasant leng ; although high impassable mountains towered on the side where leng was thought to lie , so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there , or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon .
certainly , men reached leng from very different oceans .
of other boundaries of inquanok those sailors had no notion , nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath save from vague unplaced report .
and of the marvellous sunset city which carter sought they knew nothing at all .
so the traveller asked no more of far things , but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight inquanok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on ngranek .
late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of kied .
here carter wished he might disembark , for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory , lone and unbroken , where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten .
spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed , for it is written that there may one day be need of them again ; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight , though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due .
but the ship swept on , and dusk hushed the hum of the day , and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind , leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been .
and all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected .
once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east , but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much , since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them .
in the morning the river had broadened out greatly , and carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea .
here the walls are of rugged granite , and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables .
the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland ; so that the city is not sought except for barter , but is prized for the solid work of its artisans .
the wharves of hlanith are of oak , and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns .
carter also went ashore , and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars .
the sea taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the spray of high tides , and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low ceilings and casements of greenish panes .
ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports , and told many stories of the curious men from twilight inquanok , but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told .
then at last , after much unloading and loading , the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea , and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them .
two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea , sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel .
then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its swaying on the lower slope , and carter knew that they were come to the land of and the marvellous city of celephais .
swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town , and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues , and the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea .
then rose the gentle hills behind the town , with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them ; and far in the background the purple ridge of the tanarians , potent and mystical , behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream .
the harbour was full of painted galleys , some of which were from the marble of serannian , that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky , and some of which were from more substantial parts of dreamland .
among these the steersman threaded his way up to the wharves , where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city million lights began to twinkle out over the water .
ever new seemed this deathless city of vision , for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy .
as it has always been is still the turquoise of , and the eighty priests are the same who builded it ten thousand years ago .
shining still is the bronze of the great gates , nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken .
and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable , yet without one grey hair in their forked beards .
carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel , but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors .
and when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well , and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he sought .
the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of inquanok , but was told that none were now in port , their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks .
he found , however , one thorabonian sailor who had been to inquanok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place ; and this sailor said there was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region , which everybody seemed to fear and shun .
the thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into leng horrible plateau , and that this was why men feared it ; though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels .
whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown kadath stands he did not know ; but it seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels , if indeed they existed , were stationed for nought .
on the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the .
though is chiefly worshipped in celephais , all the great ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers ; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods .
like atal in distant ulthar , he strongly advised against any attempts to see them ; declaring that they are testy and capricious , and subject to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside , whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish carter to reach it , and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them .
no man had ever found kadath in the past , and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future .
such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuring .
having thanked the , carter left the temple and sought out the bazaar of the , where the old chief of celephais ' cats dwelt sleek and contented .
that grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement , and extended a languid paw as his caller approached .
but when carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar , the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative ; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of .
best of all , he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of celephais about the men of inquanok , on whose dark ships no cat will go .
it seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them , though that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships .
the reason for this is that inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure , so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew .
whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical leng , or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north , none may say ; but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like , and to which they are more sensitive than men .
therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of inquanok .
the old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king kuranes , who in carter latter dreams had reigned alternately in the palace of the seventy delights at celephais and in the turreted of serannian .
it seemed that he could no more find content in those places , but had formed a mighty longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood ; where in little dreaming villages england old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows , and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys .
he could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead ; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the to the foot of the tanarian hills .
there he dwelt in a grey gothic of stone looking on the sea , and tried to think it was ancient trevor towers , where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light .
and on the coast nearby he had built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways , settling therein such people as had the most english faces , and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers .
and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose tower he could see from his window , placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon , and with a moss somewhat like old england moss .
for though kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream , with all imagined pomps and marvels , splendours and beauties , ecstasies and delights , novelties and excitements at his command , he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet england , that ancient , beloved england which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a part .
so when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu , he did not seek the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the .
and in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge , and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and annointed lackey of the palace , but a small stubby old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall .
and carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to england trees , and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in queen anne time .
at the door , flanked by stone cats in the old way , he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery ; and was presently taken to the library where kuranes , lord of and the sky around serannian , sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful at the vicar , with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patience .
kuranes , clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by london tailors in his youth , rose eagerly to meet his guest ; for the sight of an from the waking world was very dear to him , even if it was a saxon from boston , massachusetts , instead of from cornwall .
and for long they talked of old times , having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places .
kuranes , indeed , had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void , and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyage .
at length carter brought up the subject of his quest , and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others .
kuranes did not know where kadath was , or the marvellous sunset city ; but he did know that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out , and that the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity .
he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of space , especially in that region where form does not exist , and coloured gases study the innermost secrets .
the violet gas had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark .
altogether , it was not well to meddle with the elder ones ; and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city , it were better not to seek that city .
kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it .
he himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely celephais and the land of , and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains , and conventions , and stupidities .
but now that he was come into that city and that land , and was the king thereof , he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out , and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories .
he was a king in , but found no meaning therein , and drooped always for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth .
all his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over the downs , and all the thousand minarets of celephais for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home .
so he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite that content he sought , and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and half remembered dream .
for he had visited carter often in the old waking days , and knew well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birth .
at the last , he was very certain , the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes ; the glow of beacon hill at evening , the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport , the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and arkham , and the blessed meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure .
these things he told randolph carter , but still the seeker held to his purpose .
and in the end they parted each with his own conviction , and carter went back through the bronze gate into celephais and down the street of pillars to the old sea wall , where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inquanok , whose sailors and had in them the blood of the great ones .
one starlit evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the ship put in , and sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea wall .
it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features of ngranek , but carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen .
he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones , and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land .
they talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns ; but would gather in groups in remote comers and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places , or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland .
and so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened , even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody .
for a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of celephais , and before they sailed carter had taken passage on their dark ship , telling them that he was an old onyx miner and wishful to work in their quarries .
that ship was very lovey and cunningly wrought , being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold , and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet .
one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lilted , and as carter stood on the high stern he saw the walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless celephais sink into the distance , and the snowy peak of mount man grow smaller and smaller .
by noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea , with one painted galley afar off bound for that realm of serannian where the sea meets the sky .
and the night came with gorgeous stars , and the dark ship steered for charles ' wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole .
and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places , and they stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea .
carter went to sleep at midnight , and rose in the glow of a young morning , marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont .
and all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship , getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land , of their exquisite onyx city , and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which leng was said to be .
they told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of inquanok , and how they thought the hidden nearness of leng was to blame for it .
only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk .
there was something disquieting about that desert , and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence .
on later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was going to work .
there were many of them , for all the city of inquanok was builded of onyx , whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in rinar , ogrothan , and celephais and at home with the merchants of thraa , flarnek , and kadatheron , for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports .
and far to the north , almost in the cold desert whose existence the men of inquanok did not care to admit , there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest ; from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld .
who had mined those incredible blocks , and whither they had been transported , no man might say ; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry , around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling .
so it was left all alone in the twilight , with only the raven and the rumoured to brood on its immensities .
when carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought , for he knew from old tales that the great ones ' castle atop unknown kadath is of onyx .
each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky , and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker .
and in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all , but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day , and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night .
on the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar , the first land glimpsed since man snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship .
carter asked the captain the name of that rock , but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night .
and when , after dark , a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place , the traveller was glad that no stop had been made , and that the rock had no name .
the seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot , and carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours .
two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world .
and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs , and some knelt down on the deck to pray , so that carter knew they were come to the land of inquanok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land name .
toward noon a dark coastline appeared , and before three there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city .
rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays , all of delicate black with scrolls , flutings , and arabesques of inlaid gold .
tall and were the houses , and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light .
some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point , others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination .
the walls were low , and pierced by frequent gates , each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant ngranek .
on a hill in the centre rose a tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome .
this , the seamen said , was the temple of the elder ones , and was ruled by an old sad with inner secrets .
at intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city , answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns , viols , and chanting voices .
and from a row of tripods on a galley round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments ; for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries , and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts .
as the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest , and carter saw the slaves , sailors , and merchants on the docks .
the sailors and merchants were of the race of the gods , but the slaves were squat , slant eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from the valleys beyond leng .
the wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there , while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar , ograthan and celephais .
it was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone , and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city .
the streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow .
the houses near the water were lower than the rest , and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each .
the captain of the ship took carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries , and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city , and lead him to the taverns of the by the northern wall .
and evening fell , and little bronze lamps were lighted , and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places .
but when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city , and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto , all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away .
for there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of inquanok , and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close .
far in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not like , for it was unmistakably that of the old merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of , who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar , and even to have dealt with that not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery .
this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and kadath ; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inquanok , so close to the wonders of the north , was not a reassuring thing .
he slipped wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him , and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined , bearing the colossal and eggs of the rumoured to trade for the dextrous jade goblets that merchants brought from ilarnek .
on the following morning the led carter through the onyx streets of inquanok , dark under their twilight sky .
the inlaid doors and figured , carven balconies and oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness ; and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars , colonades , and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous .
some of the vistas down long and unbending streets , or through side alleys and over bulbous domes , spires , and arabesqued roofs , were weird and beautiful beyond words ; and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides , its flattened dome , and its lofty pinnacled belfry , overtopping all else , and majestic whatever its foreground .
and always to the east , far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land , rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous leng was said to lie .
the captain took carter to the mighty temple , which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheel hub .
the seven arched gates of that garden , each having over it a carven face like those on the city gates , are always open , and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods .
and there are fountains , pools , and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony , all of onyx and having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean .
when the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers over the garden and the city , and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates , there issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in black , bearing at arm length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises .
and all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file , legs thrown far forward without bending the knees , down the walks that lead to the seven lodges , wherein they disappear and do not appear again .
it is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple , and that the long files of priests return through them ; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told .
but only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human beings .
carter did not enter the temple , because none but the veiled king is permitted to do that .
but before he left the garden the hour of the bell came , and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him , and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates .
and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of priests in their singular way , giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give .
when the last of them had vanished he left that garden , noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed .
even the did not like that spot , and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled king palace rises and marvellous .
the ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow , all but the broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak drawn chariots .
carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps , between inlaid walls hearing strange signs in gold , and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance .
always ahead loomed those titan walls , mighty buttresses , and clustered and bulbous domes for which the veiled king palace is famous ; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch pleasure .
there carter paused in faintness at so much beauty , for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks , the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices , the brazen urns and tripods with cunning , the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble , the lagoon tiled fountains with luminous fish , the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns , the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates , and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality , and even in the land of dreams .
there it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky , with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead , and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right .
and ever the small birds and the fountains sang , while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden .
no other human presence was there , and carter was glad it was so .
then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps , for the palace itself no visitor may enter ; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome , since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured , and to send out queer dreams to the curious .
after that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town , near the gate of the caravans , where are the taverns of the yak merchants and the .
and there , in a inn of quarrymen , they said farewell ; for business called the captain whilst carter was eager to talk with miners about the north .
there were many men in that inn , and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them ; saying that he was an old miner of onyx , and anxious to know somewhat of inquanok quarries .
but all that he learned was not much more than he knew before , for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits .
they had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is said to lie , and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks .
and they whispered also that the rumoured are no wholesome things ; it being .
indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one ( for that fabled father of shantaks in the king dome is fed in the dark ) .
the next day , saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of inquanok , carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern for a journey .
beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields , with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes .
at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions ; once finding a host so austere and reticent , and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek , that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves , or upon one with full of their blood , dwelling amongst men .
and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods , and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded him .
that night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath tree to which he tied his yak , and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage .
at about ten he reached the village of urg , where traders rest and miners tell their tales , and paused in its taverns till noon .
it is here that the great caravan road turns west toward selarn , but carter kept on north by the quarry road .
all the afternoon he followed that rising road , which was somewhat narrower than the great highway , and which now led through a region with more rocks than tilled fields .
and by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizable black cliffs , so that he knew he was close to the mining country .
all the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right , and the farther he went , the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering along the way .
on the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag , tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground .
he observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point , and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them .
and on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry , and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels .
before evening he had passed eleven quarries ; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders , with no vegetation at all , but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth , with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right .
the third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west .
and they sang many songs and told many tales , shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the great ones .
they asked him whither he went , and cautioned him not to go too far to the north ; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx , and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors .
in the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north , where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men hands had wrenched prodigious blocks .
but he did not like it when , turning back to wave a last farewell , he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes , whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant .
after two more quarries the inhabited part of inquanok seemed to end , and the road narrowed to a steeply rising among forbidding black cliffs .
always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks , and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder .
soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath , and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time .
once in a while a raven would croak far overhead , and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured .
but in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed , and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became more and more reluctant to advance , and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the route .
the path now contracted between sable and glistening walls , and began to display an even greater steepness than before .
it was a bad footing , and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about .
in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest , beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky , and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course .
to reach this crest , however , was no easy task ; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular , and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones .
eventually carter dismounted and led his dubious yak ; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled , and keeping his own footing as best he might .
then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond , and gasped at what he saw .
the path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down , with the same lines of high natural walls as before ; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space , vast acres in extent , where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giant quarry .
far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge , and deep down within earth bowels its lower delvings yawned .
it was no quarry of man , and the concave sides were scarred with great squares , yards wide , which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels .
high over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked , and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness .
there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him ; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry .
all at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control , leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north .
stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom ; but carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed .
soon the left behind cliffs resumed their course , making the way once more a narrow lane ; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flight .
once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast , and doubled his speed from this encouragement .
he was covering miles , and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north .
the gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the crags , and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain .
and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears , plainer than before , but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak .
the beats were ruthless and purposeful , and they were behind him .
carter pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing , for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable .
his yak must have heard or felt it first , and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit .
meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind , so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost .
he could not see the hoofprints of his yak , but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping ; mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings .
that he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him , and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands .
only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction , and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place .
then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing .
he had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains , but now he saw it was something more .
the phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly , and even silhouetted parts of it as vapours glowed behind .
how distant it was he could not tell , but it must have been very far .
it was thousands of feet high , stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces , and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills .
but now these hills were hills no more , for some hand greater than man had touched them .
silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls , crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever .
all in a great half circle they squatted , those mountains carven into monstrous watching statues , and their right hands were raised in menace against mankind .
it was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move , but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion .
winged and whirring , those forms grew larger each moment , and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end .
they were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland , for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse .
carter knew that they must be the of ill rumour , and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert .
and as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him , where indeed was trotting the squat trader of evil legend , grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits .
trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles , randolph carter did not lose consciousness .
lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him , while the merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive .
then the man motioned carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks , helping him up as his judgement struggled with his loathing .
it was hard work ascending , for the has scales instead of feathers , and those scales are very slippery .
once he was seated , the man hopped up behind him , leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi .
there now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space , endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which leng was said to be .
far above the clouds they flew , till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of inquanok have never seen , and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist .
carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below , and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on ngranek ; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them , hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear .
the shantak now flew lower , revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires .
as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light .
and there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inquanok people are right in their geographic rumours .
for travellers have heard such sounds before , and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit ; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is leng .
around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing , and carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be ; for no healthy folk have ever been to leng , and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar .
very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap , and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold ; so that carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend , or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau .
as the shantak flew lower , the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity ; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before .
they leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet , and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns .
of other clothing they had none , but most of them were quite furry .
behind they had dwarfish tails , and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths .
then he knew what they were , and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all .
for the cryptic folk of leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at ; those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous !
they were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long ago , and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city , with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters .
now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from , and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moon .
but the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers , and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow .
day came , and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world , and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence .
at times the man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language , and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass .
ali this while the land was getting higher , and finally they came to a table land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world .
there , all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold , rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building , around which a circle of crude monoliths stood .
in all this arrangement there was nothing human , and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places , the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
the loathsome bird now settled to the ground , and the man hopped down and helped his captive alight .
of the purpose of his seizure carter now felt very sure ; for clearly the merchant was an agent of the darker powers , eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx castle .
it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the in , and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled ; taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried .
leng and the cold waste north of inquanok must be close to the other gods , and there the passes to kadath are well guarded .
the man was small , but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed ; so carter followed where he led , and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery .
there were no lights inside , but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors .
on the walls of the corridors were printed frightful scenes older than history , and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth .
after countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still , for the cold and dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things .
carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp , and shuddered at the tale they told .
through those archaic frescoes leng annals stalked ; and the horned , hooved , and danced evilly amidst forgotten cities .
there were scenes of old wars , wherein leng fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales ; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon , and of the submission of leng people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them .
those slippery blasphemies they worshipped as gods , nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys .
the monstrous made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea , and carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to inquanok ; that grey accursed rock which inquanok seamen shun , and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night .
and in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the ; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves , and wondrous with high fanes and carven places .
great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six gates to a vast central plaza , and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase .
again and again were those huge winged lions shewn , their mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night .
and as carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were , and what city it was that the had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys .
there could be no mistake , for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse .
indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied sarkomand , whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light , and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyss .
other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inquanok , and the monstrous that build nests on the ledges half way up .
and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles , and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them .
carter had seen those caves when he passed over them , and had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek .
now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one , for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens ; and those , curving horns , barbed tails , prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him .
he had met those silent , flitting and clutching creatures before ; those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones fear , and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord .
for they were the dreaded , who never laugh or smile because they have no faces , and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the vale of pnath and the passes to the outer world .
the merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking , and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring .
there was no light in this vast crypt , and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little .
at the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps ; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face .
to this being the slant eyed man made certain signs with his hands , and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask .
this colloquy went on for some time , and to carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place .
it made him think of a frightful city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it ; of that , and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond , before the rescuing rush of earth friendly cats .
he knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high priest not to be described , of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities , but he feared to think just what that abhorred might be .
then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the paws , and carter knew what the noisome was .
and in that hideous second , stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt , for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne .
he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold outside , and that even on that the noxious shantek still waited ; yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling , monstrosity .
the man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained by the pit , and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the with his hands .
carter , hitherto wholly passive , now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear , so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark .
in almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths , racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him , or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors .
after a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste , and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in .
true , they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good , but he wished none the less he had made the attempt .
those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then , and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside .
in time he became quite sure he was not followed , and slackened his pace somewhat ; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a new peril beset him .
his lamp was waning , and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance .
when the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark , and prayed to the great ones for such help as they might afford .
at times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down , and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist .
the farther he went the damper it seemed to be , and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least .
he believed , though , that his general course was down ; and the smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in leng unwholesome .
but there was not any warning of the thing which came at last ; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and chaos .
one moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place , and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been vertical .
of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure , but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy .
then he realized he was still , with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him .
all around were crumbling walls and broken columns , and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots .
behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular ; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes , and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come .
ahead stretched double rows of pillars , and the fragments and pedestals of pillars , that spoke of a broad and bygone street ; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens .
far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza , and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things .
huge winged lions of diarite they were , with blackness and shadow between them .
full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads , and snarled derisive on the ruins around them .
and carter knew right well what they must be , for legend tells of only one such twain .
they were the changeless guardians of the great abyss , and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomand .
carter first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around .
he wished no follower from leng hateful monastery , for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers .
of how to get from sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all ; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls , since he knew they were no better informed than he .
the three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach sarkomand in their journey back , but had planned to ask old traders in .
he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood , yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed .
over leng plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided ; for the emissaries must be many , while at the journey end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with .
if he could get a boat he might sail back to inquanok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea , for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from sarkomand basalt quays .
but to find a boat in this city was no probable thing , and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one .
such were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind .
all this while there had stretched before him the great width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds .
now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for , and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city .
the glow rose and fell fitfully , flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher .
and when he crept closer , down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls , he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it ; and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all .
beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor , and carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon .
then , just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame , he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound .
it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul , and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish .
secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins , carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear , and crept forward again instead of retreating .
once in crossing an open street he wriggled on his stomach , and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble .
but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery , so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where he could watch the whole scene of action .
there around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi , there squatted a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their slaves .
some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames , and at intervals applying their white hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party .
from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that the moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely , and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss , and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps .
the number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great , and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies .
of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess ; but fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the not to be described .
for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do , and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls ' black kingdom .
clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf , where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above , and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley .
it occurred to him that the portal , like other gates to the abyss , might be guarded by flocks of ; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now .
he had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls , and the ghoul which was pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understood .
so carter began another silent crawl through the ruins , edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions .
it was ticklish work , but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones .
at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunned trees and vines that had grown up therein .
the gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds , but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces , knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard .
ten feet apart crouched the beasts of diarite , brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled in fearsome .
betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx .
midway in this space a black well opened , and carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare .
terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs .
so worn and narrow were the steps , and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth , that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits ; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian would suddenly pounce upon him , if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage .
all about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs , and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind .
in time he became very numb and somnolent , moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will ; nor did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind .
he was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery had performed their duty .
awaked to the fact that he was in the cold , damp clutch of the faceless flutterers , carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight .
mindless though are said to be , the effect was instantaneous ; for all tickling stopped at once , and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position .
thus encouraged carter ventured some explanations ; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moonbeasts , and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them .
the , though inarticulate , seemed to understand what was said ; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight .
suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth , and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw .
scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place ; and as carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons , a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery , tenants .
the now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet , afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer .
carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company , and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for a rescue .
after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared , and made significant signs to the , causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark .
thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of on the plain , till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them .
meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one , all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled night gaunts .
in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist richard pickman of boston , and to him carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred .
the erstwhile pickman , pleased to greet his ancient friend again , seemed very much impressed , and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throng .
finally , after scanning the ranks with care , the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and .
a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once , while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended forelegs , awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one .
as each ghoul reached the pair of to which he was assigned , he was taken up and borne away into the blackness ; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for carter , pickman , and the other chiefs , and a few pairs of .
pickman explained that night gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls , and that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts .
then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp , slippery paws .
another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness ; endlessly up , up , up to the gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal sarkomand .
when , after a great interval , carter saw again the sickly light of sarkomand nocturnal sky , it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and .
day , he felt sure , must be almost due ; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed .
the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly , though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce .
softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless ahead , the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame .
carter was now beside pickman in the front rank of ghouls , and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts were totally unprepared .
the three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire , while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order .
the slaves were asleep , even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory .
the final swoop of the and mounted ghouls was very sudden , each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their slaves being seized by a group of before a sound was made .
the moonbeasts , of course , were voiceless ; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence .
horrible were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the sardonic clutched them , but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons .
when a moonbeast writhed too violently , a would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles ; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles .
carter expected to see much slaughter , but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans .
they glibbered certain simple orders to the which held the captives , trusting the rest to instinct ; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the great abyss , to be distributed impartially amongst the dholes , gugs , ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims .
meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk , whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for possible remaining moonbeasts , and boarded the black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat .
surely enough , the capture had been thorough , for not a sign of further life could the victors detect .
carter , anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland , urged them not to sink the anchored galley ; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio .
on the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations , some of which carter cast at once into the sea .
ghouls and now formed themselves in separate groups , the former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings .
it appeared that the three had followed carter directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to by way of nir and the skin , stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a man walk .
in taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment ; but they had persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them .
then they knew that only a ship for would serve their purpose , and prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel .
but evil spies had doubtless reported much ; for shortly a black galley put into port , and the ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern .
wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby , and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had found himself .
this time , however , the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique sarkomand ; bent evidently on taking their captives before the not to be described .
they had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inquanok mariners shun , and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the red masters of the ship ; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour .
there , too , were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident pastimes as give rise to the which men fear .
after that had come the landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures , whose continuance the present rescue had prevented .
future plans were next discussed , the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there .
to this , however , the objected ; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them .
most of the ghouls favoured the design , but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged .
thereupon carter , seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley , offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars ; to which proposal they eagerly assented .
grey day had now come , and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers ' benches .
carter found them fairly apt at learning , and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour .
not till three days later , however , did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest .
then , the rowers trained and the safely stowed in the forecastle , the party set sail at last ; pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and procedure .
on the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard .
such was their timbre that all the galley crew shook visibly ; but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant .
it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night , so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day .
when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes , and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky .
the sides of the rock were very steep ; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings , and the low railings guarding travelled highroads .
no ship of men had ever come so near the place , or at least , had never come so near and departed again ; but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on , rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands .
the headlands were prolongations of the island proper , and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them .
there seemed to be no watchers on the outside , so the galley was steered boldly through the strait and into the stagnant putrid harbour beyond .
here , however , all was bustle and activity ; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay , and scores of slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries .
there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves , with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock .
of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say , but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouraging .
at sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness ; those with eyes staring intently , and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly .
they did not , of course , realize that the black ship had changed hands ; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved , and the were all out of sight below .
by this time the leaders had fully formed a plan ; which was to loose the as soon as the wharf was touched , and then to sail directly away , leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those creatures .
marooned on the rock , the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there , and afterward , quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct , would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss ; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark , from which not much would emerge alive .
the ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the their simple instructions , while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves .
presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront , and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion .
evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock , and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the slaves whose places they were taking .
some silent alarm must have been given , for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right .
a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another ; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean bats .
the jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship , but when the struck them they thought of such things no more .
it was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime , and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above .
sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake , and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell .
when the last of the had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal , and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest .
the pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea , and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited , and dressed the wounds of the injured men .
night fell , and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds , and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the ' flight .
toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the pinnacle , and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm .
just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter , and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast .
once or twice something seemed to fall from the thing swarm into the sea ; but carter did not worry , since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts can not swim .
at length , when the ghouls were satisfied that all the had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their doomed burdens , the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands ; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stone .
frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts ; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many , and in various stages of departure from their primal state .
carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive , and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive .
the houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from , and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs .
countless weapons , implements , and ornaments lay about , including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth .
these latter did not , despite their material , invite either appropriation or long inspection ; and carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces .
the scattered spears and javelins he collected , and with pickman approval distributed among the ghouls .
such devices were new to the doglike lopers , but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints .
the upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes , and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the wild gods atop kadath .
from the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions , whose vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of leng where broods alone the not to be described .
on the distant shadowy side , beyond the noisome well , he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze ; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it , and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel .
the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts , and had profited in their fashion .
they had also found a hogshead of potent , and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings , though the rescued trio , remembering its effect on them in , had warned their company to taste none of it .
of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store , both rough and polished , in one of the vaults near the water ; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them .
carter did not try to carry any away , since he knew too much about those which had mined them .
suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves , and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront .
betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing , and it would be but a moment before the on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below .
fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter had distributed amongst them ; and at his command , sustained by the being that was pickman , they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship .
presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew discovery of the changed state of things , and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account .
after a moment of hesitation the new comers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again , but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted .
either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island ; hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy course would be .
in a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts and were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands , and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety .
almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the strait , but only for a second .
then a few moments later , a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland ; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for .
the ship itself , moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars , soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs , and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use .
by this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties , one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town .
the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions , while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party .
the sea party , commanded by carter , boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the galley of the newcomers ; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea .
carter did not at once pursue it , for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town .
meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky .
the thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine , and the general effect of those hybrid , processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies .
then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama .
javelins began to fly from both sides , and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony .
now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside , in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles .
for half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky , till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated .
on the east cliff , however , where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present , the ghouls had not fared so well ; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper .
pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town , and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat .
then , when the western battle was over , the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their fellows ; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland .
the were by this time all slain , but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws .
the time for javelins was now nearly past , and the fight became a contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge .
as fury and recklessness increased , the number falling into the sea became very great .
those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers , but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks , while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts .
the cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked , so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their .
some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above , but a few survived to be rescued .
when the security of the land parties seemed assured , carter galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea ; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean .
several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way .
finally , the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place , carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemy rear ; after which the fight was indeed .
attacked from both sides , the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea , till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them .
the hostile galley , meanwhile , had disappeared ; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors .
so by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care , finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day battles .
the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley , for pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one own wounded , and the troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill .
under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed , and carter was not sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets , whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy .
dawn found the ship in sight of sarkomand ruined quays of basalt , where a few sentries still waited , squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man .
the ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand , despatching a messenger for enough to serve them as steeds .
pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid carter had lent them .
carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well , and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland , but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown kadath , and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers .
accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders ; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into images which guard it .
he spoke of the fear of shantaks for , and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide inquanok from hateful leng .
he spoke , too , of the things he had learned concerning from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the not to be described ; how even the great ones fear them , and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at all , but hoary and immemorial nodens , lord of the great abyss .
all these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls , and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers .
he wished very much , he said , for the services of enough to bear him safely through the aft past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains , and up into the old waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal .
he desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him , and felt sure that the could take him thither without trouble ; high above the perils of the plain , and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk .
for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them .
and even were unexpected things to come from the other gods , who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth milder gods , the need not fear ; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master , but bow only to potent and archaic nodens .
a flock of ten or fifteen , carter glibbered , would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance , though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures , their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men .
the party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have , waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth .
if any ghouls chose to escort him into the of the great ones , he would be thankful , for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea .
he would not , however , insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath ; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself , in case of gods proved favourable , or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless .
whilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention , and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those for which messengers had been sent .
the winged steeds settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army , waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller .
the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with his fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at most expected .
as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts , so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned ; lending him not merely a few of their allied , but their entire army as then encamped , veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled alike , save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea .
they would set out through the aft whenever he might wish , and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earth gods in their onyx castle .
moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words , carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage .
the army would fly high , they decided , over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages ; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the whose burrows honeycombed their summits .
they would then , according to what advice they might receive from those denizens , choose their final course ; approaching unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of inquanok , or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng itself .
doglike and soulless as they are , the ghouls and had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal ; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery .
about midday the ghouls and prepared for flight , each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him .
carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman , and in front of the whole a double line of riderless was provided as a vanguard .
at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial sarkomand ; higher and higher , till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared , and the cold , sterile of leng outskirts laid open to sight .
still higher flew the black host , till even this grew small beneath them ; and as they worked northward over the plateau of horror carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped .
this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the sterile landscape , passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude , and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved , horned that dance and pipe eternally therein .
once they saw a flying low over the plain , but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic .
at dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of inquanok , and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks .
at the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures .
it soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of inquanok , for leng northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the dislike ; abysmal influences centering in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls , which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
of kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing , save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north , over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard .
they hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond , and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally ; but of definite data they had nothing to give .
so carter and his party thanked them kindly ; and , crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of inquanok , dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock .
there they squatted in a hellish , their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds ; sinister , wolflike , and , with faces of fury and right hands raised , dully and malignly watching the rim of man world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man .
from their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk , but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of was sighted in the misty sky .
northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew , and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose .
less and less luminous grew the clouds , till at length carter could see only blackness around him ; but never did the winged steeds falter , bred as they were in earth blackest crypts , and seeing not with any eyes , but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms .
on and on they flew , past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import ; ever in thickest darkness , and covering such prodigious spaces that carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth dreamland .
then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above .
all below was still black , but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere .
it was not that the figures of the constellations were different , but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain .
everything focussed toward the north ; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead .
carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of inquanok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence .
it was more broken now , with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles ; and carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and inclinations of that grotesque outline , which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge .
they were flying past at a tremendous speed , so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details ; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars , whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party .
the ghouls had likewise glimpsed it , for he heard their low glibbering all about him , and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak , of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen .
soon , however , he saw that this theory would not hold ; for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird .
its outline against the stars , necessarily vague as it was , resembled rather some huge mitred head , or pair of heads infinitely magnified ; and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one .
carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on , but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen , since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleft .
then came a wide gap in the range , where the hideous reaches of transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass trough which the stars shone wanly .
carter watched this gap with intense care , knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles .
the object had now floated ahead a trifle , and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in silhouette .
gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap , slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army .
for another minute suspense was keen , and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came ; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and meep of cosmic fear , and to the soul of the traveller a chill that never wholly left it .
for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head a mitred double head and below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it ; the mountain high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence ; the distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky , its repulsive pair of heads reaching half way to the zenith .
carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud , for he was an old dreamer ; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks , bobbing along stealthily after the first one .
and straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars , tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly , their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft .
the carven mountains , then , had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of inquanok , with right hands uplifted .
they had duties to perform , and were not remiss .
but it was horrible that they never spoke , and never even made a sound in walking .
meanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the , and the whole army soared higher into the air .
up toward the stars the grotesque column shot , till nothing stood out any longer against the sky ; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven mitred mountains that walked .
all was blackness beneath as the fluttering legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether , and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them .
the farther they went , the faster they flew , till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit .
carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them , but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties .
that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain , and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasized their northward focus ; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole , as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein .
then he noticed with terror that the wings of the were not flapping any more .
the horned and faceless steeds had folded their membranous appendages , and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on .
a force not of earth had seized on the army , and ghouls and alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned .
at length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead , thereafter rising steadily as they approached , and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars .
carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain , for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the air .
higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it , till all the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass .
lofty as the army was , that pale and sinister beacon rose above it , towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth , and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel .
no mountain known of man was that which loomed before them .
the high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills .
the groping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins .
scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven , black in eternal night , and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment clearer .
ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it , and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliff .
higher and higher rose the light , till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery .
all the north beneath it was blackness now ; dread , stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights , with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision .
carter studied the light more closely , and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the stars .
there were towers on that titan mountaintop ; horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man ; battlements and terraces of wonder and menace , all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight .
capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought , and in it glowed the .
then randolph carter knew that his quest was done , and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions ; the fabulous , the incredible home of the great ones atop unknown kadath .
even as he realised this thing , carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly party .
they were rising abruptly now , and it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone .
so close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward , and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it .
vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above , and carter could see that it was blasphemous in its immensity .
well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of inquanok , for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as air out on the steps of earth loftiest fortress .
the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow , sickly flare , so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx .
the pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers , and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse .
it was a strangely arched window , of a design wholly alien to earth .
the solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle , and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated .
vast walls shot up , and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept .
all was night in the titan courtyard , and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column .
vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx , and carter could never tell what cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless aerial twisting .
always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness , and never a sound , touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery .
large as the army of ghouls and was , it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle .
and when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon , it took carter long to discern the far walls and high , distant ceiling , and to realize that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside .
randolph carter had hoped to come into the of the great ones with poise and dignity , flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order , and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers .
he had known that the great ones themselves are not beyond a mortal power to cope with , and had trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment , as they had so often done before when men sought out earth gods in their home or on their mountains .
and with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were , knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters , and that own not nyarlathotep but only archaic nodens for their lord .
but now he saw that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels , and that the other gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild , feeble gods of earth .
void as they are of lordship over ghouls and , the mindless , shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must ; so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that randolph carter came into the great ones ' with his ghouls .
swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars , and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste , all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light , dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved .
before no golden dais had randolph carter come , nor was there any august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes , ears , thin nose , and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray .
save for the one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark , and the masters were not there .
carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold waste , but he had not found the gods .
yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors , and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin , curling mists .
earth gods were not there , it was true , but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack .
where the mild gods are absent , the other gods are not unrepresented ; and certainly , the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless .
in what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could by no means imagine .
he felt that his visit had been expected , and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
it is nyarlathotep , horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods , that the fungous moonbeasts serve ; and carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea .
reflecting upon these things , he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet .
three times pealed that frightful brazen scream , and when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw that he was alone .
whither , why and how the ghouls and night gaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him to divine .
he knew only that he was suddenly alone , and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earth friendly dreamland .
presently from the chamber uttermost reaches a new sound came .
this , too , was a rhythmic trumpeting ; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts .
in this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream ; exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence .
odours of incense came to match the golden notes ; and overhead a great light dawned , its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth spectrum , and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic harmonies .
torches flared in the distance , and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy .
out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin columns of giant black slaves with of iridescent silk .
upon their heads were strapped vast torches of glittering metal , from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals .
in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras , while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn .
armlets and anklets of gold they had , and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober gait .
that they were true black men of earth dreamland was at once apparent , but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth .
ten feet from carter the columns stopped , and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearer thick lips .
wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed , and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice .
then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode ; a tall , slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh , gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light .
close up to carter strode that regal figure ; whose proud carriage and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel , and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour .
it spoke , and in its mellow tones there rippled the wild music of lethean streams .
randolph carter , said the voice , you have come to see the great ones whom it is unlawful for men to see .
watchers have spoken of this thing , and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the whose name no lips dare speak aloud .
when barzai the wise climbed to see the greater ones dance and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned .
the other gods were there , and they did what was expected .
zenig of aphorat sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste , and his skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not name .
but you , randolph carter , have braved all things of earth dreamland , and burn still with the flame of quest .
you came not as one curious , but as one seeking his due , nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth .
yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your dreams , and wholly through their own small covetousness ; for verily , they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned , and vowed that henceforward no other spot should be their abode .
they are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your marvellous city .
all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day , and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades , arched bridges and fountains , and wide streets with urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows .
and when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew , and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars , or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the town steep northward slopes , where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles .
the gods love your marvellous city , and walk no more in the ways of the gods .
they have forgotten the high places of earth , and the mountains that knew their youth .
the earth has no longer any gods that are gods , and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered kadath .
far away in a valley of your own childhood , randolph carter , play the heedless great ones .
you have dreamed too well , o wise , for you have drawn dream gods away from the world of all men visions to that which is wholly yours ; having builded out of your boyhood small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone before .
it is not well that earth gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on , and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of others .
fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you , randolph carter , who are the cause of their upsetting , but that they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world .
in that dreamland which is yours , no power of uttermost night may pursue ; and only you can send the selfish great ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city , back through the northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold waste .
so .
randolph carter , in the name of the other gods i spare you and charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours , and to send thence the drowsy truant gods for whom the dream world waits .
not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods , that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals , that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming , and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous .
not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder , for truly , it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path .
behold !
it is not over unknown seas but back over years that your quest must go ; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes .
for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth .
it is the glory of boston hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset , of the common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the charles flows drowsily .
these things you saw , randolph carter , when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime , and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love .
and there is antique salem with its brooding years , and spectral marblehead scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries !
and the glory of salem towers and spires seen afar from marblehead pastures across the harbour against the setting sun .
there is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour , with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity , and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater .
arkham is there , with its gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it ; and antediluvian kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables , and the marvel of high cliffs and the ocean with tolling buoys beyond .
cool vales in concord , cobbled lands in portsmouth , twilight bends of rustic new hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking .
gloucester salt wharves and truro windy willows .
vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the north shore , hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in rhode island back country .
scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields ; spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn .
these , randolph carter , are your city ; for they are yourself .
new england bore you , and into your soul she poured a liquid loveliness which can not die .
this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last these endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
look !
through that window shine the stars of eternal night .
even now they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished , drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream .
there is is winking at this moment over the roofs of tremont street , and you could see him from your window on beacon hill .
out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me .
some day you too may traverse them , but if you are wise you will beware such folly ; for of those mortals who have been and returned , only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding , clawing horrors of the void .
terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space , and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater ; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands , whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter you , and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been elsewhere busy , and certain that you would yourself find the way .
shun then , the outer hells , and stick to the calm , lovely things of your youth .
seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant great ones , sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth , and which wait uneasy for their return .
easier even then the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for you .
see !
there comes hither a monstrous shantak , led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep invisible .
mount and be ready there !
yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror .
steer for that brightest star just south of the zenith it is vega , and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city .
steer for it only till you hear a singing in the high aether .
higher than that lurks madness , so rein your shantak when the first note lures .
look then back to earth , and you will see shining the deathless altar flame of from the sacred roof of a temple .
that temple is in your desiderate sunset city , so steer for it before you heed the singing and are lost .
when you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the outspread glory , prodding the shantak till he cry aloud .
that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces , and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your city wonders will not console them for the absence of kadath grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it .
then must you land amongst them with the shantak , and let them see and touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird ; meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown kadath , which you will so lately have left , and telling them how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted , where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance .
and the shantak will talk to them in the manner of shantaks , but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder days .
over and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home and youth , till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten .
thereat can you loose the waiting shantak , sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind ; hearing which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth , and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods , through the deep gulfs of heaven to kadath familiar towers and domes .
then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit for ever , and once more will earth gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat .
go now the casement is open and the stars await outside .
already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience .
steer for vega through the night , but turn when the singing sounds .
forget not this warning , lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness .
remember the other gods ; they are great and mindless and terrible , and lurk in the outer voids .
they are good gods to shun .
hei !
!
you are off !
send back earth gods to their haunts on unknown kadath , and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms .
farewell , randolph carter , and beware ; for i am nyarlathotep , the crawling chaos .
and randolph carter , gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak , shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega ; looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earth dreamland .
great polypous horrors slid darkly past , and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous around him , but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird .
the stars danced mockingly , almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared before ; and ever the winds of nether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos .
then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent , and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn .
trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible , there rose a timid hint of melody , droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not .
and as that music grew , the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead , and carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain .
it was a song , but not the song of any voice .
night and the spheres sang it , and it was old when space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were born .
faster flew the shantak , and lower bent the rider , drunk with the marvel of strange gulfs , and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic .
then came too late the warning of the evil one , the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song .
only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city ; only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at will .
for madness and the void wild vengeance are nyarlathotep only gifts to the presumptuous ; and frantick though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed , that leering , tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless , flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinity centre the mindless azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud .
unswerving and obedient to the foul legate orders , that hellish bird plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness , and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and pawed ; the nameless larvae of the other gods , that are like them blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts onward unswerving and relentless , and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the spheres had turned , that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider ; hurtling and shooting , cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses ; leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter , and darting through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time wherein azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled , maddening beat of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes .
onward onward through the screaming , cackling , and blackly populous gulfs and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to randolph carter the doomed .
too well had nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising , for he had brought up that which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface .
home new england beacon hill the waking world .
for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth the glory of boston hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset ; of the flower fragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the charles flows drowsily this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
onward onward dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered .
but the image and the thought had come , and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming , and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his infancy still lay .
words came again you need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
turn turn blackness on every side , but randolph carter could turn .
thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses , randolph carter could turn and move .
he could move , and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of nyarlathotep .
he could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down , those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos ' core .
he could turn and move and leap he could he would he would he would .
off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer , and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell .
aeons reeled , universes died and were born again , stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars , and still randolph carter fell through those endless voids of sentient blackness .
then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into another futile completion , and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before .
matter and light were born anew as space once had known them ; and comets , suns and worlds sprang flaming into life , though nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone , been and gone , always and always , back to no first beginning .
and there was a firmament again , and a wind , and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the falling dreamer .
there were gods and presences and wills ; beauty and evil , and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey .
for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamer boyhood , and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things .
out of the void the violet gas had pointed the way , and archaic nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps .
stars swelled to dawns , and dawns burst into fountains of gold , carmine , and purple , and still the dreamer fell .
cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside .
and hoary nodens raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep , close on his quarry , stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless to grey dust .
randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city , for he was come again to the fair new england world that had wrought him .
so to the organ chords of morning myriad whistles , and dawn blaze thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the state house on the hill , randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within his boston room .
birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared .
beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured , while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his master start and shriek had disturbed .
and vast infinities away , past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden lands and the cerenarian sea and the twilight reaches of inquanok , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste , and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city .
yes , he lived here but i do advise your doing anything .
your curiosity makes you irresponsible .
we never come here at night , and it only because of his will that we keep it this way .
you know what he did .
that abominable society took charge at last , and we do know where he is buried .
there was no way the law or anything else could reach the society .
i hope you wo stay till after dark .
and i beg of you to let that thing on the table the thing that looks like a alone .
we do know what it is , but we suspect it has something to do with what he did .
we even avoid looking at it very steadily .
after a time the man left me alone in the attic room .
it was very dingy and dusty , and only primitively furnished , but it had a neatness which showed it was not a quarters .
there were shelves full of theological and classical books , and another bookcase containing treatises on magic paracelsus , albertus magnus , trithemius , hermes trismegistus , borellus , and others in a strange alphabet whose titles i could not decipher .
the furniture was very plain .
there was a door , but it led only into a closet .
the only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude , steep staircase led .
the windows were of pattern , and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity .
plainly , this house was of the old world .
i seemed to know where i was , but can not recall what i then knew .
certainly the town was not london .
my impression is of a small seaport .
the small object on the table fascinated me intensely .
i seemed to know what to do with it , for i drew a pocket electric light or what looked like one out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes .
the light was not white but violet , and seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment .
i recall that i did not regard it as a common flashlight indeed , i had a common flashlight in another pocket .
it was getting dark , and the ancient roofs and outside looked very queer through the .
finally i summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it .
the light seemed now to be more like a rain of hail or small violet particles than like a continuous beam .
as the particles struck the glassy surface at the center of the strange device , they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed .
the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow , and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its center .
then i noticed that i was not alone in the room and put the ray projector back in my pocket .
but the newcomer did not speak nor did i hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments .
everything was shadowy pantomime , as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close , as if both near and distant , according to some abnormal geometry .
the newcomer was a thin , dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church .
he was apparently about thirty years old , with a sallow , olive complexion and fairly good features , but an abnormally high forehead .
his black hair was well cut and neatly brushed , and he was though with a heavy growth of beard .
he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows .
his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen , but he had a vastly higher forehead , and was darker and more also more subtly and concealedly .
at the present moment having just lighted a faint oil lamp he looked nervous , and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room ( where the wall slanted sharply ) which i had not noticed before .
the flames devoured the volumes greedily leaping up in strange colors and emitting indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element .
all at once i saw there were others in the room men in clerical costume , one of whom wore the bands and of a bishop .
though i could hear nothing , i could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the .
they seemed to hate and fear him at the same time , and he seemed to return these sentiments .
his face set itself into a grim expression , but i could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair .
the bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace ( where the flames had died down amidst a charred , mass ) , and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing .
the then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table .
everyone then seemed frightened .
the procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor , turning and making menacing gestures as they left .
the bishop was last to go .
the now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope .
mounting a chair , he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak , and began making a noose with the other end .
realizing he was about to hang himself , i started forward to dissuade or save him .
he saw me and ceased his preparations , looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me .
he slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark , face .
i felt somehow in deadly peril , and drew out the peculiar as a weapon of defense .
why i thought it could help me , i do not know .
i turned it on full in his face , and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light .
his expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear which did not , however , wholly displace the exultation .
he stopped in his tracks then , flailing his arms wildly in the air , began to stagger backwards .
i saw he was edging toward the open in the floor , and tried to shout a warning , but he did not hear me .
in another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view .
i found difficulty in moving toward the , but when i did get there i found no crushed body on the floor below .
instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns , for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken , and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally .
something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place .
had there been a noise i had not heard ?
presently the two people ( simple villagers , apparently ) farthest in the lead saw me and stood paralyzed .
one of them shrieked loudly and reverberantly ahrrh ! it , zur ?
again ?
then they all turned and fled frantically .
all , that is , but one .
when the crowd was gone i saw the man who had brought me to this place standing alone with a lantern .
he was gazing at me gaspingly and fascinatedly , but did not seem afraid .
then he began to ascend the stairs , and joined me in the attic .
he spoke so you did let it alone !
i sorry .
i know what has happened .
it happened once before , but the man got frightened and shot himself .
you ought not to have made him come back .
you know what he wants .
but you must get frightened like the other man he got .
something very strange and terrible has happened to you , but it did get far enough to hurt your mind and personality .
if you keep cool , and accept the need for making certain radical readjustments in your life , you can keep right on enjoying the world , and the fruits of your scholarship .
but you ca live here and i do think you wish to go back to london .
i advise america .
you must try anything more with that thing .
nothing can be put back now .
it would only make matters worse to do or summon anything .
you are not as badly off as you might be but you must get out of here at once and stay away .
you better thank heaven it did go further i going to prepare you as bluntly as i can .
there been a certain change in your personal appearance .
he always causes that .
but in a new country you can get used to it .
there a mirror up at the other end of the room , and i going to take you to it .
you get a shock though you will see nothing repulsive .
i was now shaking with a deadly fear , and the bearded man almost had to hold me up as he walked me across the room to the mirror , the faint lamp ( , that formerly on the table , not the still fainter lantern he had brought ) in his free hand .
this is what i saw in the glass a thin , dark man of medium stature attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church , apparently about thirty , and with rimless , steel bowed glasses glistening beneath a sallow , olive forehead of abnormal height .
it was the silent who had burned his books .
for all the rest of my life , in outward form , i was to be that man !
i have never heard an even approximately adequate explanation of the horror at martin beach .
despite the large number of witnesses , no two accounts agree ; and the testimony taken by local authorities contains the most amazing discrepancies .
perhaps this haziness is natural in view of the character of the horror itself , the almost paralytic terror of all who saw it , and the efforts made by the fashionable wavecrest inn to hush it up after the publicity created by ahon article are hypnotic powers confined to recognized humanity ?
against all these obstacles i am striving to present a coherent version ; for i beheld the hideous occurrence , and believe it should be known in view of the appalling possibilities it suggests .
martin beach is once more popular as a , but i shudder when i think of it .
indeed , i can not look at the ocean at all now without shuddering .
fate is not always without a sense of drama and climax , hence the terrible happening of august , , swiftly followed a period of minor and agreeably excitement at martin beach .
on may the crew of the fishing smack alma of gloucester , under capt .
james orne , killed , after a battle of nearly forty hours , a marine monster whose size and aspect produced the greatest possible stir in scientific circles and caused certain boston naturalists to take every precaution for its taxidermic preservation .
the object was some fifty feet in length , of roughly cylindrical shape , and about ten feet in diameter .
it was unmistakably a gilled fish in its major affiliations ; but with certain curious modifications such as rudimentary forelegs and feet in place of pectoral fins , which prompted the widest speculation .
its extraordinary mouth , its thick and scaly hide , and its single , eye were wonders scarcely less remarkable than its colossal dimensions ; and when the naturalists pronounced it an infant organism , which could not have been hatched more than a few days , public interest mounted to extraordinary heights .
capt .
orne , with typical yankee shrewdness , obtained a vessel large enough to hold the object in its hull , and arranged for the exhibition of his prize .
with judicious carpentry he prepared what amounted to an excellent marine museum , and , sailing south to the wealthy resort district of martin beach , anchored at the hotel wharf and reaped a harvest of admission fees .
the intrinsic marvelousness of the object , and the importance which it clearly bore in the minds of many scientific visitors from near and far , combined to make it the season sensation .
that it was absolutely unique unique to a scientifically revolutionary degree was well understood .
the naturalists had shown plainly that it radically differed from the similarly immense fish caught off the florida coast ; that , while it was obviously an inhabitant of almost incredible depths , perhaps thousands of feet , its brain and principal organs indicated a development startlingly vast , and out of all proportion to anything hitherto associated with the fish tribe .
on the morning of july the sensation was increased by the loss of the vessel and its strange treasure .
in the storm of the preceding night it had broken from its moorings and vanished forever from the sight of man , carrying with it the guard who had slept aboard despite the threatening weather .
capt .
orne , backed by extensive scientific interests and aided by large numbers of fishing boats from gloucester , made a thorough and exhaustive searching cruise , but with no result other than the prompting of interest and conversation .
by august hope was abandoned , and capt .
orne had returned to the wavecrest inn to wind up his business affairs at martin beach and confer with certain of the scientific men who remained there .
the horror came on august .
it was in the twilight , when grey hovered low near the shore and a rising moon began to make a glittering path across the waters .
the scene is important to remember , for every impression counts .
on the beach were several strollers and a few late bathers ; stragglers from the distant cottage colony that rose modestly on a green hill to the north , or from the adjacent inn whose imposing towers proclaimed its allegiance to wealth and grandeur .
well within viewing distance was another set of spectators , the loungers on the inn and veranda , who appeared to be enjoying the dance music from the sumptuous ballroom inside .
these spectators , who included capt .
orne and his group of scientific confreres , joined the beach group before the horror progressed far ; as did many more from the inn .
certainly there was no lack of witnesses , confused though their stories be with fear and doubt of what they saw .
there is no exact record of the time the thing began , although a majority say that the fairly round moon was about a foot above the vapors of the horizon .
they mention the moon because what they saw seemed subtly connected with it a sort of stealthy , deliberate , menacing ripple which rolled in from the far skyline along the shimmering lane of reflected moonbeams , yet which seemed to subside before it reached the shore .
many did not notice this ripple until reminded by later events ; but it seems to have been very marked , differing in height and motion from the normal waves around it .
some called it cunning and calculating .
and as it died away craftily by the black reefs afar out , there suddenly came belching up out of the brine a cry of death ; a scream of anguish and despair that moved pity even while it mocked it .
first to respond to the cry were the two life guards then on duty ; sturdy fellows in white bathing attire , with their calling proclaimed in large red letters across their chests .
accustomed as they were to rescue work , and to the screams of the drowning , they could find nothing familiar in the unearthly ululation ; yet with a trained sense of duty they ignored the strangeness and proceeded to follow their usual course .
hastily seizing an , which with its attached coil of rope lay always at hand , one of them ran swiftly along the shore to the scene of the gathering crowd ; whence , after whirling it about to gain momentum , he flung the hollow disc far out in the direction from which the sound had come .
as the cushion disappeared in the waves , the crowd curiously awaited a sight of the hapless being whose distress had been so great ; eager to see the rescue made by the massive rope .
but that rescue was soon acknowledged to be no swift and easy matter ; for , pull as they might on the rope , the two muscular guards could not move the object at the other end .
instead , they found that object pulling with equal or even greater force in the very opposite direction , till in a few seconds they were dragged off their feet and into the water by the strange power which had seized on the proffered .
one of them , recovering himself , called immediately for help from the crowd on the shore , to whom he flung the remaining coil of rope ; and in a moment the guards were seconded by all the hardier men , among whom capt .
orne was foremost .
more than a dozen strong hands were now tugging desperately at the stout line , yet wholly without avail .
hard as they tugged , the strange force at the other end tugged harder ; and since neither side relaxed for an instant , the rope became rigid as steel with the enormous strain .
the struggling participants , as well as the spectators , were by this time consumed with curiosity as to the nature of the force in the sea .
the idea of a drowning man had long been dismissed ; and hints of whales , submarines , monsters , and demons now passed freely around .
where humanity had first led the rescuers , wonder kept them at their task ; and they hauled with a grim determination to uncover the mystery .
it being decided at last that a whale must have swallowed the , capt .
orne , as a natural leader , shouted to those on shore that a boat must be obtained in order to approach , harpoon , and land the unseen leviathan .
several men at once prepared to scatter in quest of a suitable craft , while others came to supplant the captain at the straining rope , since his place was logically with whatever boat party might be formed .
his own idea of the situation was very broad , and by no means limited to whales , since he had to do with a monster so much stranger .
he wondered what might be the acts and manifestations of an adult of the species of which the creature had been the merest infant .
and now there developed with appalling suddenness the crucial fact which changed the entire scene from one of wonder to one of horror , and dazed with fright the assembled band of toilers and onlookers .
capt .
orne , turning to leave his post at the rope , found his hands held in their place with unaccountable strength ; and in a moment he realized that he was unable to let go of the rope .
his plight was instantly divined , and as each companion tested his own situation the same condition was encountered .
the fact could not be denied every struggler was irresistibly held in some mysterious bondage to the hempen line which was slowly , hideously , and relentlessly pulling them out to sea .
speechless horror ensued ; a horror in which the spectators were petrified to utter inaction and mental chaos .
their complete demoralization is reflected in the conflicting accounts they give , and the sheepish excuses they offer for their seemingly callous inertia .
i was one of them , and know .
even the strugglers , after a few frantic screams and futile groans , succumbed to the paralyzing influence and kept silent and fatalistic in the face of unknown powers .
there they stood in the pallid moonlight , blindly pulling against a spectral doom and swaying monotonously backward and forward as the water rose first to their knees , then to their hips .
the moon went partly under a cloud , and in the the line of swaying men resembled some sinister and gigantic centipede , writhing in the clutch of a terrible creeping death .
harder and harder grew the rope , as the tug in both directions increased , and the strands swelled with the undisturbed soaking of the rising waves .
slowly the tide advanced , till the sands so lately peopled by laughing children and whispering lovers were now swallowed by the inexorable flow .
the herd of watchers surged blindly backward as the water crept above their feet , while the frightful line of strugglers swayed hideously on , half submerged , and now at a substantial distance from their audience .
silence was complete .
the crowd , having gained a beyond reach of the tide , stared in mute fascination ; without offering a word of advice or encouragement , or attempting any kind of assistance .
there was in the air a nightmare fear of impending evils such as the world had never before known .
minutes seemed lengthened into hours , and still that human snake of swaying torsos was seen above the fast rising tide .
rhythmically it undulated ; slowly , horribly , with the seal of doom upon it .
thicker clouds now passed over the ascending moon , and the glittering path on the waters faded nearly out .
very dimly writhed the serpentine line of nodding heads , with now and then the livid face of a victim gleaming pale in the darkness .
faster and faster gathered the clouds , till at length their angry rifts shot down sharp tongues of febrile flame .
thunders rolled , softly at first , yet soon increasing to a deafening , maddening intensity .
then came a culminating crash a shock whose reverberations seemed to shake land and sea alike and on its heels a cloudburst whose drenching violence overpowered the darkened world as if the heavens themselves had opened to pour forth a vindictive torrent .
the spectators , instinctively acting despite the absence of conscious and coherent thought , now retreated up the cliff steps to the hotel veranda .
rumors had reached the guests inside , so that the refugees found a state of terror nearly equal to their own .
i think a few frightened words were uttered , but can not be sure .
some , who were staying at the inn , retired in terror to their rooms ; while others remained to watch the fast sinking victims as the line of bobbing heads showed above the mounting waves in the fitful lightning flashes .
i recall thinking of those heads , and the bulging eyes they must contain ; eyes that might well reflect all the fright , panic , and delirium of a malignant universe all the sorrow , sin , and misery , blasted hopes and unfulfilled desires , fear , loathing and anguish of the ages since time beginning ; eyes alight with all the pain of eternally blazing infernos .
and as i gazed out beyond the heads , my fancy conjured up still another eye ; a single eye , equally alight , yet with a purpose so revolting to my brain that the vision soon passed .
held in the clutches of an unknown vise , the line of the damned dragged on ; their silent screams and unuttered prayers known only to the demons of the black waves and the .
there now burst from the infuriate sky such a mad cataclysm of satanic sound that even the former crash seemed dwarfed .
amidst a blinding glare of descending fire the voice of heaven resounded with the blasphemies of hell , and the mingled agony of all the lost reverberated in one apocalyptic , peal of cyclopean din .
it was the end of the storm , for with uncanny suddenness the rain ceased and the moon once more cast her pallid beams on a strangely quieted sea .
there was no line of bobbing heads now .
the waters were calm and deserted , and broken only by the fading ripples of what seemed to be a whirlpool far out in the path of the moonlight whence the strange cry had first come .
but as i looked along that treacherous lane of silvery sheen , with fancy fevered and senses overwrought , there trickled upon my ears from some abysmal sunken waste the faint and sinister echoes of a laugh .
i v i not many weeks ago , on a street corner in the village of pascoag , rhode island , a tall , heavily built , and pedestrian furnished much speculation by a singular lapse of behaviour .
he had , it appears , been descending the hill by the road from chepachet ; and encountering the compact section , had turned to his left into the main thoroughfare where several modest business blocks convey a touch of the urban .
at this point , without visible provocation , he committed his astonishing lapse ; staring queerly for a second at the tallest of the buildings before him , and then , with a series of terrified , hysterical shrieks , breaking into a frantic run which ended in a stumble and fall at the next crossing .
picked up and dusted off by ready hands , he was found to be conscious , organically unhurt , and evidently cured of his sudden nervous attack .
he muttered some shamefaced explanations involving a strain he had undergone , and with downcast glance turned back up the chepachet road , trudging out of sight without once looking behind him .
it was a strange incident to befall so large , robust , , and a man , and the strangeness was not lessened by the remarks of a bystander who had recognised him as the boarder of a dairyman on the outskirts of chepachet .
he was , it developed , a new york police detective named thomas malone , now on a long leave of absence under medical treatment after some disproportionately arduous work on a gruesome local case which accident had made dramatic .
there had been a collapse of several old brick buildings during a raid in which he had shared , and something about the wholesale loss of life , both of prisoners and of his companions , had peculiarly appalled him .
as a result , he had acquired an acute and anomalous horror of any buildings even remotely suggesting the ones which had fallen in , so that in the end mental specialists forbade him the sight of such things for an indefinite period .
a police surgeon with relatives in chepachet had put forward that quaint hamlet of wooden colonial houses as an ideal spot for the psychological convalescence ; and thither the sufferer had gone , promising never to venture among the streets of larger villages till duly advised by the woonsocket specialist with whom he was put in touch .
this walk to pascoag for magazines had been a mistake , and the patient had paid in fright , bruises , and humiliation for his disobedience .
so much the gossips of chepachet and pascoag knew ; and so much , also , the most learned specialists believed .
but malone had at first told the specialists much more , ceasing only when he saw that utter incredulity was his portion .
thereafter he held his peace , protesting not at all when it was generally agreed that the collapse of certain squalid brick houses in the red hook section of brooklyn , and the consequent death of many brave officers , had unseated his nervous equilibrium .
he had worked too hard , all said , in trying to clean up those nests of disorder and violence ; certain features were shocking enough , in all conscience , and the unexpected tragedy was the last straw .
this was a simple explanation which everyone could understand , and because malone was not a simple person he perceived that he had better let it suffice .
to hint to unimaginative people of a horror beyond all human conception a horror of houses and blocks and cities leprous and cancerous with evil dragged from elder worlds would be merely to invite a padded cell instead of a restful rustication , and malone was a man of sense despite his mysticism .
he had the celt far vision of weird and hidden things , but the logician quick eye for the outwardly unconvincing ; an amalgam which had led him far afield in the years of his life , and set him in strange places for a dublin university man born in a georgian villa near phoenix park .
and now , as he reviewed the things he had seen and felt and apprehended , malone was content to keep unshared the secret of what could reduce a dauntless fighter to a quivering neurotic ; what could make old brick slums and seas of dark , subtle faces a thing of nightmare and eldritch portent .
it would not be the first time his sensations had been forced to bide uninterpreted for was not his very act of plunging into the polyglot abyss of new york underworld a freak beyond sensible explanation ?
what could he tell the prosaic of the antique witcheries and grotesque marvels discernible to sensitive eyes amidst the poison cauldron where all the varied dregs of unwholesome ages mix their venom and perpetuate their obscene terrors ?
he had seen the hellish green flame of secret wonder in this blatant , evasive welter of outward greed and inward blasphemy , and had smiled gently when all the he knew scoffed at his experiment in police work .
they had been very witty and cynical , deriding his fantastic pursuit of unknowable mysteries and assuring him that in these days new york held nothing but cheapness and vulgarity .
one of them had wagered him a heavy sum that he could not despite many poignant things to his credit in the dublin review even write a truly interesting story of new york low life ; and now , looking back , he perceived that cosmic irony had justified the prophet words while secretly confuting their flippant meaning .
the horror , as glimpsed at last , could not make a story for like the book cited by poe german authority , lässt sich nicht lesen it does not permit itself to be read . '
to malone the sense of latent mystery in existence was always present .
in youth he had felt the hidden beauty and ecstasy of things , and had been a poet ; but poverty and sorrow and exile had turned his gaze in darker directions , and he had thrilled at the imputations of evil in the world around .
daily life had for him come to be a phantasmagoria of macabre ; now glittering and leering with concealed rottenness as in beardsley best manner , now hinting terrors behind the commonest shapes and objects as in the subtler and less obvious work of gustave doré .
he would often regard it as merciful that most persons of high intelligence jeer at the inmost mysteries ; for , he argued , if superior minds were ever placed in fullest contact with the secrets preserved by ancient and lowly cults , the resultant abnormalities would soon not only wreck the world , but threaten the very integrity of the universe .
all this reflection was no doubt morbid , but keen logic and a deep sense of humour ably offset it .
malone was satisfied to let his notions remain as and forbidden visions to be lightly played with ; and hysteria came only when duty flung him into a hell of revelation too sudden and insidious to escape .
he had for some time been detailed to the butler street station in brooklyn when the red hook matter came to his notice .
red hook is a maze of hybrid squalor near the ancient waterfront opposite governor island , with dirty highways climbing the hill from the wharves to that higher ground where the decayed lengths of clinton and court streets lead off toward the borough hall .
its houses are mostly of brick , dating from the first quarter to the middle of the nineteenth century , and some of the obscurer alleys and byways have that alluring antique flavour which conventional reading leads us to call ' .
the population is a hopeless tangle and enigma ; syrian , spanish , italian , and negro elements impinging upon one another , and fragments of scandinavian and american belts lying not far distant .
it is a babel of sound and filth , and sends out strange cries to answer the lapping oily waves at its grimy piers and the monstrous organ litanies of the harbour whistles .
here long ago a brighter picture dwelt , with clear eyed mariners on the lower streets and homes of taste and substance where the larger houses line the hill .
one can trace the relics of this former happiness in the trim shapes of the buildings , the occasional graceful churches , and the evidences of original art and background in bits of detail here and there a worn flight of steps , a battered doorway , a wormy pair of decorative columns or pilasters , or a fragment of once green space with bent and rusted iron railing .
the houses are generally in solid blocks , and now and then a cupola arises to tell of days when the households of captains and watched the sea .
from this tangle of material and spiritual putrescence the blasphemies of an hundred dialects assail the sky .
hordes of prowlers reel shouting and singing along the lanes and thoroughfares , occasional furtive hands suddenly extinguish lights and pull down curtains , and swarthy , faces disappear from windows when visitors pick their way through .
policemen despair of order or reform , and seek rather to erect barriers protecting the outside world from the contagion .
the clang of the patrol is answered by a kind of spectral silence , and such prisoners as are taken are never communicative .
visible offences are as varied as the local dialects , and run the gamut from the smuggling of rum and prohibited aliens through diverse stages of lawlessness and obscure vice to murder and mutilation in their most abhorrent guises .
that these visible affairs are not more frequent is not to the neighbourhood credit , unless the power of concealment be an art demanding credit .
more people enter red hook than leave it or at least , than leave it by the landward side and those who are not loquacious are the likeliest to leave .
malone found in this state of things a faint stench of secrets more terrible than any of the sins denounced by citizens and bemoaned by priests and philanthropists .
he was conscious , as one who united imagination with scientific knowledge , that modern people under lawless conditions tend uncannily to repeat the darkest instinctive patterns of primitive savagery in their daily life and ritual observances ; and he had often viewed with an anthropologist shudder the chanting , cursing processions of and pockmarked young men which wound their way along in the dark small hours of morning .
one saw groups of these youths incessantly ; sometimes in leering vigils on street corners , sometimes in doorways playing eerily on cheap instruments of music , sometimes in stupefied dozes or indecent dialogues around cafeteria tables near borough hall , and sometimes in whispering converse around dingy taxicabs drawn up at the high stoops of crumbling and closely shuttered old houses .
they chilled and fascinated him more than he dared confess to his associates on the force , for he seemed to see in them some monstrous thread of secret continuity ; some fiendish , cryptical , and ancient pattern utterly beyond and below the sordid mass of facts and habits and haunts listed with such conscientious technical care by the police .
they must be , he felt inwardly , the heirs of some shocking and primordial tradition ; the sharers of debased and broken scraps from cults and ceremonies older than mankind .
their coherence and definiteness suggested it , and it shewed in the singular suspicion of order which lurked beneath their squalid disorder .
he had not read in vain such treatises as miss murray in western europe ; and knew that up to recent years there had certainly survived among peasants and furtive folk a frightful and clandestine system of assemblies and orgies descended from dark religions antedating the aryan world , and appearing in popular legends as black masses and witches ' sabbaths .
that these hellish vestiges of old magic and fertility cults were even now wholly dead he could not for a moment suppose , and he frequently wondered how much older and how much blacker than the very worst of the muttered tales some of them might really be .
it was the case of robert suydam which took malone to the heart of things in red hook .
suydam was a lettered recluse of ancient dutch family , possessed originally of barely independent means , and inhabiting the spacious but mansion which his grandfather had built in flatbush when that village was little more than a pleasant group of colonial cottages surrounding the steepled and reformed church with its yard of netherlandish gravestones .
in his lonely house , set back from martense street amidst a yard of venerable trees , suydam had read and brooded for some six decades except for a period a generation before , when he had sailed for the old world and remained there out of sight for eight years .
he could afford no servants , and would admit but few visitors to his absolute solitude ; eschewing close friendships and receiving his rare acquaintances in one of the three rooms which he kept in order a vast , library whose walls were solidly packed with tattered books of ponderous , archaic , and vaguely repellent aspect .
the growth of the town and its final absorption in the brooklyn district had meant nothing to suydam , and he had come to mean less and less to the town .
elderly people still pointed him out on the streets , but to most of the recent population he was merely a queer , corpulent old fellow whose unkempt white hair , stubbly beard , shiny black clothes , and cane earned him an amused glance and nothing more .
malone did not know him by sight till duty called him to the case , but had heard of him indirectly as a really profound authority on mediaeval superstition , and had once idly meant to look up an pamphlet of his on the kabbalah and the faustus legend , which a friend had quoted from memory .
suydam became a case when his distant and only relatives sought court pronouncements on his sanity .
their action seemed sudden to the outside world , but was really undertaken only after prolonged observation and sorrowful debate .
it was based on certain odd changes in his speech and habits ; wild references to impending wonders , and unaccountable hauntings of disreputable brooklyn neighbourhoods .
he had been growing shabbier and shabbier with the years , and now prowled about like a veritable mendicant ; seen occasionally by humiliated friends in subway stations , or loitering on the benches around borough hall in conversation with groups of swarthy , strangers .
when he spoke it was to babble of unlimited powers almost within his grasp , and to repeat with knowing leers such mystical words or names as ' , ' , and ' .
the court action revealed that he was using up his income and wasting his principal in the purchase of curious tomes imported from london and paris , and in the maintenance of a squalid basement flat in the red hook district where he spent nearly every night , receiving odd delegations of mixed rowdies and foreigners , and apparently conducting some kind of ceremonial service behind the green blinds of secretive windows .
detectives assigned to follow him reported strange cries and chants and prancing of feet filtering out from these nocturnal rites , and shuddered at their peculiar ecstasy and abandon despite the commonness of weird orgies in that sodden section .
when , however , the matter came to a hearing , suydam managed to preserve his liberty .
before the judge his manner grew urbane and reasonable , and he freely admitted the queerness of demeanour and extravagant cast of language into which he had fallen through excessive devotion to study and research .
he was , he said , engaged in the investigation of certain details of european tradition which required the closest contact with foreign groups and their songs and folk dances .
the notion that any low secret society was preying upon him , as hinted by his relatives , was obviously absurd ; and shewed how sadly limited was their understanding of him and his work .
triumphing with his calm explanations , he was suffered to depart unhindered ; and the paid detectives of the suydams , corlears , and van brunts were withdrawn in resigned disgust .
it was here that an alliance of federal inspectors and police , malone with them , entered the case .
the law had watched the suydam action with interest , and had in many instances been called upon to aid the private detectives .
in this work it developed that suydam new associates were among the blackest and most vicious criminals of red hook devious lanes , and that at least a third of them were known and repeated offenders in the matter of thievery , disorder , and the importation of illegal immigrants .
indeed , it would not have been too much to say that the old scholar particular circle coincided almost perfectly with the worst of the organized cliques which smuggled ashore certain nameless and unclassified asian dregs wisely turned back by ellis island .
in the teeming rookeries of parker place since renamed where suydam had his basement flat , there had grown up a very unusual colony of unclassified folk who used the arabic alphabet but were eloquently repudiated by the great mass of syrians in and around atlantic avenue .
they could all have been deported for lack of credentials , but legalism is , and one does not disturb red hook unless publicity forces one to .
these creatures attended a tumbledown stone church , used wednesdays as a , which reared its gothic buttresses near the vilest part of the waterfront .
it was nominally catholic ; but priests throughout brooklyn denied the place all standing and authenticity , and policemen agreed with them when they listened to the noises it emitted at night .
malone used to fancy he heard terrible cracked bass notes from a hidden organ far underground when the church stood empty and unlighted , whilst all observers dreaded the shrieking and drumming which accompanied the visible services .
suydam , when questioned , said he thought the ritual was some remnant of nestorian christianity tinctured with the shamanism of thibet .
most of the people , he conjectured , were of mongoloid stock , originating somewhere in or near kurdistan and malone could not help recalling that kurdistan is the land of the yezidis , last survivors of the persian .
however this may have been , the stir of the suydam investigation made it certain that these unauthorised newcomers were flooding red hook in increasing numbers ; entering through some marine conspiracy unreached by revenue officers and harbour police , overrunning parker place and rapidly spreading up the hill , and welcomed with curious fraternalism by the other assorted denizens of the region .
their squat figures and characteristic squinting physiognomies , grotesquely combined with flashy american clothing , appeared more and more numerously among the loafers and nomad gangsters of the borough hall section ; till at length it was deemed necessary to compute their numbers , ascertain their sources and occupations , and find if possible a way to round them up and deliver them to the proper immigration authorities .
to this task malone was assigned by agreement of federal and city forces , and as he commenced his canvass of red hook he felt poised upon the brink of nameless terrors , with the shabby , unkempt figure of robert suydam as and adversary .
police methods are varied and ingenious .
malone , through unostentatious rambles , carefully casual conversations , offers of liquor , and judicious dialogues with frightened prisoners , learned many isolated facts about the movement whose aspect had become so menacing .
the newcomers were indeed kurds , but of a dialect obscure and puzzling to exact philology .
such of them as worked lived mostly as and unlicenced pedlars , though frequently serving in greek restaurants and tending corner news stands .
most of them , however , had no visible means of support ; and were obviously connected with underworld pursuits , of which smuggling and ' were the least indescribable .
they had come in steamships , apparently tramp freighters , and had been unloaded by stealth on moonless nights in rowboats which stole under a certain wharf and followed a hidden canal to a secret subterranean pool beneath a house .
this wharf , canal , and house malone could not locate , for the memories of his informants were exceedingly confused , while their speech was to a great extent beyond even the ablest interpreters ; nor could he gain any real data on the reasons for their systematic importation .
they were reticent about the exact spot from which they had come , and were never sufficiently off guard to reveal the agencies which had sought them out and directed their course .
indeed , they developed something like acute fright when asked the reasons for their presence .
gangsters of other breeds were equally taciturn , and the most that could be gathered was that some god or great priesthood had promised them powers and supernatural glories and rulerships in a strange land .
the attendance of both newcomers and old gangsters at suydam closely guarded nocturnal meetings was very regular , and the police soon learned that the erstwhile recluse had leased additional flats to accommodate such guests as knew his password ; at last occupying three entire houses and permanently harbouring many of his queer companions .
he spent but little time now at his flatbush home , apparently going and coming only to obtain and return books ; and his face and manner had attained an appalling pitch of wildness .
malone twice interviewed him , but was each time brusquely repulsed .
he knew nothing , he said , of any mysterious plots or movements ; and had no idea how the kurds could have entered or what they wanted .
his business was to study undisturbed the folklore of all the immigrants of the district ; a business with which policemen had no legitimate concern .
malone mentioned his admiration for suydam old brochure on the kabbalah and other myths , but the old man softening was only momentary .
he sensed an intrusion , and rebuffed his visitor in no uncertain way ; till malone withdrew disgusted , and turned to other channels of information .
what malone would have unearthed could he have worked continuously on the case , we shall never know .
as it was , a stupid conflict between city and federal authority suspended the investigations for several months , during which the detective was busy with other assignments .
but at no time did he lose interest , or fail to stand amazed at what began to happen to robert suydam .
just at the time when a wave of kidnappings and disappearances spread its excitement over new york , the unkempt scholar embarked upon a metamorphosis as startling as it was absurd .
one day he was seen near borough hall with face , hair , and tastefully immaculate attire , and on every day thereafter some obscure improvement was noticed in him .
he maintained his new fastidiousness without interruption , added to it an unwonted sparkle of eye and crispness of speech , and began little by little to shed the corpulence which had so long deformed him .
now frequently taken for less than his age , he acquired an elasticity of step and buoyancy of demeanour to match the new tradition , and shewed a curious darkening of the hair which somehow did not suggest dye .
as the months passed , he commenced to dress less and less conservatively , and finally astonished his new friends by renovating and redecorating his flatbush mansion , which he threw open in a series of receptions , summoning all the acquaintances he could remember , and extending a special welcome to the fully forgiven relatives who had so lately sought his restraint .
some attended through curiosity , others through duty ; but all were suddenly charmed by the dawning grace and urbanity of the former hermit .
he had , he asserted , accomplished most of his allotted work ; and having just inherited some property from a half forgotten european friend , was about to spend his remaining years in a brighter second youth which ease , care , and diet had made possible to him .
less and less was he seen at red hook , and more and more did he move in the society to which he was born .
policemen noted a tendency of the gangsters to congregate at the old stone church and instead of at the basement flat in parker place , though the latter and its recent annexes still overflowed with noxious life .
then two incidents occurred wide enough apart , but both of intense interest in the case as malone envisaged it .
one was a quiet announcement in the eagle of robert suydam engagement to miss cornelia gerritsen of bayside , a young woman of excellent position , and distantly related to the elderly ; whilst the other was a raid on the church by city police , after a report that the face of a kidnapped child had been seen for a second at one of the basement windows .
malone had participated in this raid , and studied the place with much care when inside .
nothing was found in fact , the building was entirely deserted when visited but the sensitive celt was vaguely disturbed by many things about the interior .
there were crudely painted panels he did not like panels which depicted sacred faces with peculiarly worldly and sardonic expressions , and which occasionally took liberties that even a layman sense of decorum could scarcely countenance .
then , too , he did not relish the greek inscription on the wall above the pulpit ; an ancient incantation which he had once stumbled upon in dublin college days , and which read , literally translated , ' o friend and companion of night , thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood , who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs , who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals , gorgo , mormo , look favourably on our sacrifices ! '
when he read this he shuddered , and thought vaguely of the cracked bass organ notes he fancied he had heard beneath the church on certain nights .
he shuddered again at the rust around the rim of a metal basin which stood on the altar , and paused nervously when his nostrils seemed to detect a curious and ghastly stench from somewhere in the neighbourhood .
that organ memory haunted him , and he explored the basement with particular assiduity before he left .
the place was very hateful to him ; yet after all , were the blasphemous panels and inscriptions more than mere crudities perpetrated by the ignorant ?
by the time of suydam wedding the kidnapping epidemic had become a popular newspaper scandal .
most of the victims were young children of the lowest classes , but the increasing number of disappearances had worked up a sentiment of the strongest fury .
journals clamoured for action from the police , and once more the butler street station sent its men over red hook for clues , discoveries , and criminals .
malone was glad to be on the trail again , and took pride in a raid on one of suydam parker place houses .
there , indeed , no stolen child was found , despite the tales of screams and the red sash picked up in the areaway ; but the paintings and rough inscriptions on the peeling walls of most of the rooms , and the primitive chemical laboratory in the attic , all helped to convince the detective that he was on the track of something tremendous .
the paintings were appalling hideous monsters of every shape and size , and parodies on human outlines which can not be described .
the writing was in red , and varied from arabic to greek , roman , and hebrew letters .
malone could not read much of it , but what he did decipher was portentous and cabbalistic enough .
one frequently repeated motto was in a sort of hebraised hellenistic greek , and suggested the most terrible of the alexandrian decadence circles and pentagrams loomed on every hand , and told indubitably of the strange beliefs and aspirations of those who dwelt so squalidly here .
in the cellar , however , the strangest thing was found a pile of genuine gold ingots covered carelessly with a piece of burlap , and bearing upon their shining surfaces the same weird hieroglyphics which also adorned the walls .
during the raid the police encountered only a passive resistance from the squinting orientals that swarmed from every door .
finding nothing relevant , they had to leave all as it was ; but the precinct captain wrote suydam a note advising him to look closely to the character of his tenants and protégés in view of the growing public clamour .
v then came the june wedding and the great sensation .
flatbush was gay for the hour about high noon , and pennanted motors thronged the streets near the old dutch church where an awning stretched from door to highway .
no local event ever surpassed the nuptials in tone and scale , and the party which escorted bride and groom to the cunard pier was , if not exactly the smartest , at least a solid page from the social register .
at five adieux were waved , and the ponderous liner edged away from the long pier , slowly turned its nose seaward , discarded its tug , and headed for the widening water spaces that led to old world wonders .
by night the outer harbour was cleared , and late passengers watched the stars twinkling above an unpolluted ocean .
whether the tramp steamer or the scream was first to gain attention , no one can say .
probably they were simultaneous , but it is of no use to calculate .
the scream came from the suydam stateroom , and the sailor who broke down the door could perhaps have told frightful things if he had not forthwith gone completely mad as it is , he shrieked more loudly than the first victims , and thereafter ran simpering about the vessel till caught and put in irons .
the ship doctor who entered the stateroom and turned on the lights a moment later did not go mad , but told nobody what he saw till afterward , when he corresponded with malone in chepachet .
it was murder strangulation but one need not say that the on suydam throat could not have come from her husband or any other human hand , or that upon the white wall there flickered for an instant in hateful red a legend which , later copied from memory , seems to have been nothing less than the fearsome chaldee letters of the word ' .
one need not mention these things because they vanished so quickly as for suydam , one could at least bar others from the room until one knew what to think oneself .
the doctor has distinctly assured malone that he did not see .
the open porthole , just before he turned on the lights , was clouded for a second with a certain phosphorescence , and for a moment there seemed to echo in the night outside the suggestion of a faint and hellish tittering ; but no real outline met the eye .
as proof , the doctor points to his continued sanity .
then the tramp steamer claimed all attention .
a boat put off , and a horde of swart , insolent ruffians in officers ' dress swarmed aboard the temporarily halted cunarder .
they wanted suydam or his body they had known of his trip , and for certain reasons were sure he would die .
the captain deck was almost a pandemonium ; for at the instant , between the doctor report from the stateroom and the demands of the men from the tramp , not even the wisest and gravest seaman could think what to do .
suddenly the leader of the visiting mariners , an arab with a hatefully negroid mouth , pulled forth a dirty , crumpled paper and handed it to the captain .
it was signed by robert suydam , and bore the following odd message .
captain and doctor looked at each other , and the latter whispered something to the former .
finally they nodded rather helplessly and led the way to the suydam stateroom .
the doctor directed the captain glance away as he unlocked the door and admitted the strange seamen , nor did he breathe easily till they filed out with their burden after an unaccountably long period of preparation .
it was wrapped in bedding from the berths , and the doctor was glad that the outlines were not very revealing .
somehow the men got the thing over the side and away to their tramp steamer without uncovering it .
the cunarder started again , and the doctor and a ship undertaker sought out the suydam stateroorn to perform what last services they could .
once more the physician was forced to reticence and even to mendacity , for a hellish thing had happened .
when the undertaker asked him why he had drained off all of suydam blood , he neglected to affirm that he had not done so ; nor did he point to the vacant on the rack , or to the odour in the sink which shewed the hasty disposition of the bottles ' original contents .
the pockets of those men if men they were had bulged damnably when they left the ship .
two hours later , and the world knew by radio all that it ought to know of the horrible affair .
that same june evening , without having heard a word from the sea , malone was desperately busy among the alleys of red hook .
a sudden stir seemed to permeate the place , and as if apprised by telegraph ' of something singular , the denizens clustered expectantly around the church and the houses in parker place .
three children had just disappeared norwegians from the streets toward gowanus and there were rumours of a mob forming among the sturdy vikings of that section .
malone had for weeks been urging his colleagues to attempt a general cleanup ; and at last , moved by conditions more obvious to their common sense than the conjectures of a dublin dreamer , they had agreed upon a final stroke .
the unrest and menace of this evening had been the deciding factor , and just about midnight a raiding party recruited from three stations descended upon parker place and its environs .
doors were battered in , stragglers arrested , and candlelighted rooms forced to disgorge unbelievable throngs of mixed foreigners in figured robes , mitres , and other inexplicable devices .
much was lost in the melee , for objects were thrown hastily down unexpected shafts , and betraying odours deadened by the sudden kindling of pungent incense .
but spattered blood was everywhere , and malone shuddered whenever he saw a brazier or altar from which the smoke was still rising .
he wanted to be in several places at once , and decided on suydam basement flat only after a messenger had reported the complete emptiness of the dilapidated church .
the flat , he thought , must hold some clue to a cult of which the occult scholar had so obviously become the centre and leader ; and it was with real expectancy that he ransacked the musty rooms , noted their vaguely charnel odour , and examined the curious books , instruments , gold ingots , and bottles scattered carelessly here and there .
once a lean , cat edged between his feet and tripped him , overturning at the same time a beaker half full of a red liquid .
the shock was severe , and to this day malone is not certain of what he saw ; but in dreams he still pictures that cat as it scuttled away with certain monstrous alterations and peculiarities .
then came the locked cellar door , and the search for something to break it down .
a heavy stool stood near , and its tough seat was more than enough for the antique panels .
a crack formed and enlarged , and the whole door gave way but from the other side ; whence poured a howling tumult of wind with all the stenches of the bottomless pit , and whence reached a sucking force not of earth or heaven , which , coiling sentiently about the paralysed detective , dragged him through the aperture and down unmeasured spaces filled with whispers and wails , and gusts of mocking laughter .
of course it was a dream .
all the specialists have told him so , and he has nothing to prove the contrary .
indeed , he would rather have it thus ; for then the sight of old brick slums and dark foreign faces would not eat so deeply into his soul .
but at the time it was all horribly real , and nothing can ever efface the memory of those nighted crypts , those titan arcades , and those shapes of hell that strode gigantically in silence holding things whose still surviving portions screamed for mercy or laughed with madness .
odours of incense and corruption joined in sickening concert , and the black air was alive with the cloudy , bulk of shapeless elemental things with eyes .
somewhere dark sticky water was lapping at onyx piers , and once the shivery tinkle of raucous little bells pealed out to greet the insane titter of a naked phosphorescent thing which swam into sight , scrambled ashore , and climbed up to squat leeringly on a carved golden pedestal in the background .
avenues of limitless night seemed to radiate in every direction , till one might fancy that here lay the root of a contagion destined to sicken and swallow cities , and engulf nations in the foetor of hybrid pestilence .
here cosmic sin had entered , and festered by unhallowed rites had commenced the grinning march of death that was to rot us all to fungous abnormalities too hideous for the grave holding .
satan here held his babylonish court , and in the blood of stainless childhood the leprous limbs of phosphorescent lilith were laved .
incubi and succubae howled praise to hecate , and headless bleated to the magna mater .
goats leaped to the sound of thin accursed flutes , and aegipans chased endlessly after misshapen fauns over rocks twisted like swollen toads .
moloch and ashtaroth were not absent ; for in this quintessence of all damnation the bounds of consciousness were let down , and man fancy lay open to vistas of every realm of horror and every forbidden dimension that evil had power to mould .
the world and nature were helpless against such assaults from unsealed wells of night , nor could any sign or prayer check the of horror which had come when a sage with the hateful key had stumbled on a horde with the locked and brimming coffer of transmitted .
suddenly a ray of physical light shot through these phantasms , and malone heard the sound of oars amidst the blasphemies of things that should be dead .
a boat with a lantern in its prow darted into sight , made fast to an iron ring in the slimy stone pier , and vomited forth several dark men bearing a long burden swathed in bedding .
they took it to the naked phosphorescent thing on the carved golden pedestal , and the thing tittered and pawed at the bedding .
then they unswathed it , and propped upright before the pedestal the gangrenous corpse of a corpulent old man with stubbly beard and unkempt white hair .
the phosphorescent thing tittered again , and the men produced bottles from their pockets and anointed its feet with red , whilst they afterward gave the bottles to the thing to drink from .
all at once , from an arcaded avenue leading endlessly away , there came the daemoniac rattle and wheeze of a blasphemous organ , choking and rumbling out the mockeries of hell in a cracked , sardonic bass .
in an instant every moving entity was electrified ; and forming at once into a ceremonial procession , the nightmare horde slithered away in quest of the sound goat , satyr , and aegipan , incubus , succubus and lemur , twisted toad and shapeless elemental , howler and silent strutter in darkness all led by the abominable naked phosphorescent thing that had squatted on the carved golden throne , and that now strode insolently bearing in its arms the corpse of the corpulent old man .
the strange dark men danced in the rear , and the whole column skipped and leaped with dionysiac fury .
malone staggered after them a few steps , delirious and hazy , and doubtful of his place in this or in any world .
then he turned , faltered , and sank down on the cold damp stone , gasping and shivering as the daemon organ croaked on , and the howling and drumming and tinkling of the mad procession grew fainter and fainter .
vaguely he was conscious of chanted horrors and shocking croakings afar off .
now and then a wail or whine of ceremonial devotion would float to him through the black arcade , whilst eventually there rose the dreadful greek incantation whose text he had read above the pulpit of that church .
as the chant closed , a general shout went up , and hissing sounds nearly drowned the croaking of the cracked bass organ .
then a gasp as from many throats , and a babel of barked and bleated words , great lilith , behold the bridegroom ! '
more cries , a clamour of rioting , and the sharp , clicking footfalls of a running figure .
the footfalls approached , and malone raised himself to his elbow to look .
the luminosity of the crypt , lately diminished , had now slightly increased ; and in that there appeared the fleeing form of that which should not flee or feel or breathe the , gangrenous corpse of the corpulent old man , now needing no support , but animated by some infernal sorcery of the rite just closed .
after it raced the naked , tittering , phosphorescent thing that belonged on the carven pedestal , and still farther behind panted the dark men , and all the dread crew of sentient loathsomenesses .
the corpse was gaining on its pursuers , and seemed bent on a definite object , straining with every rotting muscle toward the carved golden pedestal , whose necromantic importance was evidently so great .
another moment and it had reached its goal , whilst the trailing throng laboured on with more frantic speed .
but they were too late , for in one final spurt of strength which ripped tendon from tendon and sent its noisome bulk floundering to the floor in a state of jellyish dissolution , the staring corpse which had been robert suydam achieved its object and its triumph .
the push had been tremendous , but the force had held out ; and as the pusher collapsed to a muddy blotch of corruption the pedestal he had pushed tottered , tipped , and finally careened from its onyx base into the thick waters below , sending up a parting gleam of carven gold as it sank heavily to undreamable gulfs of lower tartarus .
in that instant , too , the whole scene of horror faded to nothingness before malone eyes ; and he fainted amidst a thunderous crash which seemed to blot out all the evil universe .
malone dream , experienced in full before he knew of suydam death and transfer at sea , was curiously supplemented by some odd realities of the case ; though that is no reason why anyone should believe it .
the three old houses in parker place , doubtless long rotten with decay in its most insidious form , collapsed without visible cause while half the raiders and most of the prisoners were inside ; and of both the greater number were instantly killed .
only in the basements and cellars was there much saving of life , and malone was lucky to have been deep below the house of robert suydam .
for he really was there , as no one is disposed to deny .
they found him unconscious by the edge of a pool , with a grotesquely horrible jumble of decay and bone , identifiable through dental work as the body of suydam , a few feet away .
the case was plain , for it was hither that the smugglers ' underground canal led ; and the men who took suydam from the ship had brought him home .
they themselves were never found , or at least never identified ; and the ship doctor is not yet satisfied with the simple certitudes of the police .
suydam was evidently a leader in extensive operations , for the canal to his house was but one of several subterranean channels and tunnels in the neighbourhood .
there was a tunnel from this house to a crypt beneath the church ; a crypt accessible from the church only through a narrow secret passage in the north wall , and in whose chambers some singular and terrible things were discovered .
the croaking organ was there , as well as a vast arched chapel with wooden benches and a strangely figured altar .
the walls were lined with small cells , in seventeen of which hideous to relate solitary prisoners in a state of complete idiocy were found chained , including four mothers with infants of disturbingly strange appearance .
these infants died soon after exposure to the light ; a circumstance which the doctors thought rather merciful .
nobody but malone , among those who inspected them , remembered the sombre question of old delrio sint unquam daemones incubi et succubae , et an ex tali congressu proles nasci queat ? '
before the canals were filled up they were thoroughly dredged , and yielded forth a sensational array of sawed and split bones of all sizes .
the kidnapping epidemic , very clearly , had been traced home ; though only two of the surviving prisoners could by any legal thread be connected with it .
these men are now in prison , since they failed of conviction as accessories in the actual murders .
the carved golden pedestal or throne so often mentioned by malone as of primary occult importance was never brought to light , though at one place under the suydam house the canal was observed to sink into a well too deep for dredging .
it was choked up at the mouth and cemented over when the cellars of the new houses were made , but malone often speculates on what lies beneath .
the police , satisfied that they had shattered a dangerous gang of maniacs and , turned over to the federal authorities the unconvicted kurds , who before their deportation were conclusively found to belong to the yezidi clan of .
the tramp ship and its crew remain an elusive mystery , though cynical detectives are once more ready to combat its smuggling and ventures .
malone thinks these detectives shew a sadly limited perspective in their lack of wonder at the myriad unexplainable details , and the suggestive obscurity of the whole case ; though he is just as critical of the newspapers , which saw only a morbid sensation and gloated over a minor sadist cult which they might have proclaimed a horror from the universe very heart .
but he is content to rest silent in chepachet , calming his nervous system and praying that time may gradually transfer his terrible experience from the realm of present reality to that of picturesque and remoteness .
robert suydam sleeps beside his bride in greenwood cemetery .
no funeral was held over the strangely released bones , and relatives are grateful for the swift oblivion which overtook the case as a whole .
the scholar connexion with the red hook horrors , indeed , was never emblazoned by legal proof ; since his death forestalled the inquiry he would otherwise have faced .
his own end is not much mentioned , and the suydams hope that posterity may recall him only as a gentle recluse who dabbled in harmless magic and folklore .
as for red hook it is always the same .
suydam came and went ; a terror gathered and faded ; but the evil spirit of darkness and squalor broods on amongst the mongrels in the old brick houses , and prowling bands still parade on unknown errands past windows where lights and twisted faces unaccountably appear and disappear .
horror is a hydra with a thousand heads , and the cults of darkness are rooted in blasphemies deeper than the well of democritus .
the soul of the beast is omnipresent and triumphant , and red hook legions of , pockmarked youths still chant and curse and howl as they file from abyss to abyss , none knows whence or whither , pushed on by blind laws of biology which they may never understand .
as of old , more people enter red hook than leave it on the landward side , and there are already rumours of new canals running underground to certain centres of traffic in liquor and less mentionable things .
the church is now mostly a , and queer faces have appeared at night at the windows .
lately a policeman expressed the belief that the crypt has been dug out again , and for no simply explainable purpose .
who are we to combat poisons older than history and mankind ?
apes danced in asia to those horrors , and the cancer lurks secure and spreading where furtiveness hides in rows of decaying brick .
malone does not shudder without cause for only the other day an officer overheard a swarthy squinting hag teaching a small child some whispered patois in the shadow of an areaway .
he listened , and thought it very strange when he heard her repeat over and over again .
' o friend and companion of night , thou who rejoicest in the baying of dogs and spilt blood , who wanderest in the midst of shades among the tombs , who longest for blood and bringest terror to mortals , gorgo , mormo , look favourably on our sacrifices ! '
in my tortured ears there sounds unceasingly a nightmare whirring and flapping , and a faint distant baying as of some gigantic hound .
it is not dream it is not , i fear , even madness for too much has already happened to give me these merciful doubts .
st john is a mangled corpse ; i alone know why , and such is my knowledge that i am about to blow out my brains for fear i shall be mangled in the same way .
down unlit and illimitable corridors of eldrith phantasy sweeps the black , shapeless nemesis that drives me to .
may heaven forgive the folly and morbidity which led us both to so monstrous a fate !
wearied with the commonplaces of a prosaic world ; where even the joys of romance and adventure soon grow stale , st john and i had followed enthusiastically every aesthetic and intellectual movement which promised respite from our devastating ennui .
the enigmas of the symbolists and the ecstasies of the all were ours in their time , but each new mood was drained too soon , of its diverting novelty and appeal .
only the somber philosophy of the decadents could help us , and this we found potent only by increasing gradually the depth and diablism of our penetrations .
baudelaire and huysmans were soon exhausted of thrills , till finally there remained for us only the more direct stimuli of unnatural personal experiences and adventures .
it was this frightful emotional need which led us eventually to that detestable course which even in my present fear i mention with shame and timidity that hideous extremity of human outrage , the abhorred practice of .
i can not reveal the details of our shocking expedition , or catalogue even partly the worst of the trophies adorning the nameless museum where we jointly dwelt , alone and servantless .
our museum was a blasphemous , unthinkable place , where with the satanic taste of neurotic virtuosi we had assembled an universe of terror and a secret room , far , far , underground ; where huge winged daemons carven of basalt and onyx vomited from wide grinning mouths weird green and orange light , and hidden pneumatic pipes ruffled into kaleidoscopic dances of death the line of red charnel things hand in hand woven in voluminous black hangings .
through these pipes came at will the odors our moods most craved ; sometimes the scent of pale funeral lilies ; sometimes the narcotic incense of imagined eastern shrines of the kingly dead , and sometimes how i shudder to recall it ! the frightful , stenches of the .
around the walls of this repellent chamber were cases of antique mummies alternating with comely , lifelike bodies perfectly stuffed and cured by the taxidermist art , and with headstones snatched from the oldest churchyards of the world .
niches here and there contained skulls of all shapes , and heads preserved in various stages of dissolution .
there one might find the rotting , bald pates of famous noblemen , and the flesh and radiantly golden heads of children .
statues and painting there were , all of fiendish subjects and some executed by st john and myself .
a locked portfolio , bound in tanned human skin , held certain unknown and unnameable drawings which it was rumored goya had perpetrated but dared not acknowledge .
there were nauseous musical instruments , stringed , brass , , on which st john and i sometimes produced dissonances of exquisite morbidity and cacodaemoniacal ghastliness ; whilst in a multitude of inlaid ebony cabinets reposed the most incredible and unimaginable variety of ever assembled by human madness and perversity .
it is of this loot in particular that i destroy it long before i thought of destroying myself !
the predatory excursions on which we collected our unmentionable treasures were always artistically memorable events .
we were no vulgar ghouls , but worked only under certain conditions of mood , landscape , environment , weather , season , and moonlight .
these pastimes were to us the most exquisite form of aesthetic expression , and we gave their details a fastidious technical care .
an inappropriate hour , a jarring lighting effect , or a clumsy manipulation of the damp sod , would almost totally destroy for us that ecstatic titillation which followed the exhumation of some ominous , grinning secret of the earth .
our quest for novel scenes and piquant conditions was feverish and insatiate st john was always the leader , and he it was who led the way at last to that mocking , accursed spot which brought us our hideous and inevitable doom .
by what malign fatality were we lured to that terrible holland churchyard ?
i think it was the dark rumor and legendry , the tales of one buried for five centuries , who had himself been a ghoul in his time and had stolen a potent thing from a mighty sepulchre .
i can recall the scene in these final moments the pale autumnal moon over the graves , casting long horrible shadows ; the grotesque trees , drooping sullenly to meet the neglected grass and the crumbling slabs ; the vast legions of strangely colossal bats that flew against the moon ; the antique ivied church pointing a huge spectral finger at the livid sky ; the phosphorescent insects that danced like under the yews in a distant corner ; the odors of mould , vegetation , and less explicable things that mingled feebly with the from over far swamps and seas ; and , worst of all , the faint baying of some gigantic hound which we could neither see nor definitely place .
as we heard this suggestion of baying we shuddered , remembering the tales of the peasantry ; for he whom we sought had centuries before been found in this self same spot , torn and mangled by the claws and teeth of some unspeakable beast .
i remember how we delved in the ghoul grave with our spades , and how we thrilled at the picture of ourselves , the grave , the pale watching moon , the horrible shadows , the grotesque trees , the titanic bats , the antique church , the dancing , the sickening odors , the gently moaning , and the strange , directionless baying of whose objective existence we could scarcely be sure .
then we struck a substance harder than the damp mould , and beheld a rotting oblong box crusted with mineral deposits from the long undisturbed ground .
it was incredibly tough and thick , but so old that we finally pried it open and feasted our eyes on what it held .
much amazingly much was left of the object despite the lapse of five hundred years .
the skeleton , though crushed in places by the jaws of the thing that had killed it , held together with surprising firmness , and we gloated over the clean white skull and its long , firm teeth and its eyeless sockets that once had glowed with a charnel fever like our own .
in the coffin lay an amulet of curious and exotic design , which had apparently been worn around the sleeper neck .
it was the oddly conventionalised figure of a crouching winged hound , or sphinx with a face , and was exquisitely carved in antique oriental fashion from a small piece of green jade .
the expression of its features was repellent in the extreme , savoring at once of death , bestiality and malevolence .
around the base was an inscription in characters which neither st john nor i could identify ; and on the bottom , like a maker seal , was graven a grotesque and formidable skull .
immediately upon beholding this amulet we knew that we must possess it ; that this treasure alone was our logical pelf from the centuried grave .
even had its outlines been unfamiliar we would have desired it , but as we looked more closely we saw that it was not wholly unfamiliar .
alien it indeed was to all art and literature which sane and balanced readers know , but we recognized it as the thing hinted of in the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred ; the ghastly of the cult of inaccessible leng , in central asia .
all too well did we trace the sinister lineaments described by the old arab daemonologist ; lineaments , he wrote , drawn from some obscure supernatural manifestation of the souls of those who vexed and gnawed at the dead .
seizing the green jade object , we gave a last glance at the bleached and face of its owner and closed up the grave as we found it .
as we hastened from the abhorrent spot , the stolen amulet in st john pocket , we thought we saw the bats descend in a body to the earth we had so lately rifled , as if seeking for some cursed and unholy nourishment .
but the autumn moon shone weak and pale , and we could not be sure .
so , too , as we sailed the next day away from holland to our home , we thought we heard the faint distant baying of some gigantic hound in the background .
but the autumn wind moaned sad and wan , and we could not be sure .
less than a week after our return to england , strange things began to happen .
we lived as recluses ; devoid of friends , alone , and without servants in a few rooms of an ancient on a bleak and unfrequented moor ; so that our doors were seldom disturbed by the knock of the visitor .
now , however , we were troubled by what seemed to be a frequent fumbling in the night , not only around the doors but around the windows also , upper as well as lower .
once we fancied that a large , opaque body darkened the library window when the moon was shining against it , and another time we thought we heard a whirring or flapping sound not far off .
on each occasion investigation revealed nothing , and we began to ascribe the occurrences to imagination which still prolonged in our ears the faint far baying we thought we had heard in the holland churchyard .
the jade amulet now reposed in a niche in our museum , and sometimes we burned a strangely scented candle before it .
we read much in alhazred necronomicon about its properties , and about the relation of ghosts ' souls to the objects it symbolized ; and were disturbed by what we read .
then terror came .
on the night of september , , i heard a knock at my chamber door .
fancying it st john , i bade the knocker enter , but was answered only by a shrill laugh .
there was no one in the corridor .
when i aroused st john from his sleep , he professed entire ignorance of the event , and became as worried as i .
it was the night that the faint , distant baying over the moor became to us a certain and dreaded reality .
four days later , whilst we were both in the hidden museum , there came a low , cautious scratching at the single door which led to the secret library staircase .
our alarm was now divided , for , besides our fear of the unknown , we had always entertained a dread that our grisly collection might be discovered .
extinguishing all lights , we proceeded to the door and threw it suddenly open ; whereupon we felt an unaccountable rush of air , and heard , as if receding far away , a queer combination of rustling , tittering , and articulate chatter .
whether we were mad , dreaming , or in our senses , we did not try to determine .
we only realized , with the blackest of apprehensions , that the apparently disembodied chatter was beyond a doubt in the dutch language .
after that we lived in growing horror and fascination .
mostly we held to the theory that we were jointly going mad from our life of unnatural excitements , but sometimes it pleased us more to dramatize ourselves as the victims of some creeping and appalling doom .
bizarre manifestations were now too frequent to count .
our lonely house was seemingly alive with the presence of some malign being whose nature we could not guess , and every night that daemoniac baying rolled over the moor , always louder and louder .
on october we found in the soft earth underneath the library window a series of footprints utterly impossible to describe .
they were as baffling as the hordes of great bats which haunted the old in unprecedented and increasing numbers .
the horror reached a culmination on november , when st john , walking home after dark from the dismal railway station , was seized by some frightful carnivorous thing and torn to ribbons .
his screams had reached the house , and i had hastened to the terrible scene in time to hear a whir of wings and see a vague black cloudy thing silhouetted against the rising moon .
my friend was dying when i spoke to him , and he could not answer coherently .
all he could do was to whisper , the amulet that damned thing then he collapsed , an inert mass of mangled flesh .
i buried him the next midnight in one of our neglected gardens , and mumbled over his body one of the devilish rituals he had loved in life .
and as i pronounced the last daemoniac sentence i heard afar on the moor the faint baying of some gigantic hound .
the moon was up , but i dared not look at it .
and when i saw on the moor a wide , nebulous shadow sweeping from mound to mound , i shut my eyes and threw myself face down upon the ground .
when i arose , trembling , i know not how much later , i staggered into the house and made shocking obeisances before the enshrined amulet of green jade .
being now afraid to live alone in the ancient house on the moor , i departed on the following day for london , taking with me the amulet after destroying by fire and burial the rest of the impious collection in the museum .
but after three nights i heard the baying again , and before a week was over felt strange eyes upon me whenever it was dark .
one evening as i strolled on victoria embankment for some needed air , i saw a black shape obscure one of the reflections of the lamps in the water .
a wind , stronger than the , rushed by , and i knew that what had befallen st john must soon befall me .
the next day i carefully wrapped the green jade amulet and sailed for holland .
what mercy i might gain by returning the thing to its silent , sleeping owner i knew not ; but i felt that i must try any step conceivably logical .
what the hound was , and why it had pursued me , were questions still vague ; but i had first heard the baying in that ancient churchyard , and every subsequent event including st john dying whisper had served to connect the curse with the stealing of the amulet .
accordingly i sank into the nethermost abysses of despair when , at an inn in rotterdam , i discovered that thieves had despoiled me of this sole means of salvation .
the baying was loud that evening , and in the morning i read of a nameless deed in the vilest quarter of the city .
the rabble were in terror , for upon an evil tenement had fallen a red death beyond the foulest previous crime of the neighborhood .
in a squalid thieves ' den an entire family had been torn to shreds by an unknown thing which left no trace , and those around had heard all night a faint , deep , insistent note as of a gigantic hound .
so at last i stood again in the unwholesome churchyard where a pale winter moon cast hideous shadows and leafless trees drooped sullenly to meet the withered , frosty grass and cracking slabs , and the ivied church pointed a jeering finger at the unfriendly sky , and the night wind howled maniacally from over frozen swamps and frigid seas .
the baying was very faint now , and it ceased altogether as i approached the ancient grave i had once violated , and frightened away an abnormally large horde of bats which had been hovering curiously around it .
i know not why i went thither unless to pray , or gibber out insane pleas and apologies to the calm white thing that lay within ; but , whatever my reason , i attacked the half frozen sod with a desperation partly mine and partly that of a dominating will outside myself .
excavation was much easier than i expected , though at one point i encountered a queer interruption ; when a lean vulture darted down out of the cold sky and pecked frantically at the until i killed him with a blow of my spade .
finally i reached the rotting oblong box and removed the damp nitrous cover .
this is the last rational act i ever performed .
for crouched within that centuried coffin , embraced by a closepacked nightmare retinue of huge , sinewy , sleeping bats , was the bony thing my friend and i had robbed ; not clean and placid as we had seen it then , but covered with caked blood and shreds of alien flesh and hair , and leering sentiently at me with phosphorescent sockets and sharp ensanguined fangs yawning twistedly in mockery of my inevitable doom .
and when it gave from those grinning jaws a deep , sardonic bay as of some gigantic hound , and i saw that it held in its gory filthy claw the lost and fateful amulet of green jade , i merely screamed and ran away idiotically , my screams soon dissolving into peals of hysterical laughter .
madness rides the claws and teeth sharpened on centuries of corpses dripping death astride a bacchanale of bats from nigh black ruins of buried temples of belial now , as the baying of that dead fleshless monstrosity grows louder and louder , and the stealthy whirring and flapping of those accursed closer and closer , i shall seek with my revolver the oblivion which is my only refuge from the unnamed and unnameable .
i .
the shadow on the chimney .
a passer in the storm .
what the red glare meant .
the horror in the eyes i .
the shadow on the chimney there was thunder in the air on the night i went to the deserted mansion atop tempest mountain to find the lurking fear .
i was not alone , for foolhardiness was not then mixed with that love of the grotesque and the terrible which has made my career a series of quests for strange horrors in literature and in life .
with me were two faithful and muscular men for whom i had sent when the time came ; men long associated with me in my ghastly explorations because of their peculiar fitness .
we had started quietly from the village because of the reporters who still lingered about after the eldritch panic of a month before the nightmare creeping death .
later , i thought , they might aid me ; but i did not want them then .
would to god i had let them share the search , that i might not have had to bear the secret alone so long ; to bear it alone for fear the world would call me mad or go mad itself at the demon implications of the thing .
now that i am telling it anyway , lest the brooding make me a maniac , i wish i had never concealed it .
for i , and i only , know what manner of fear lurked on that spectral and desolate mountain .
in a small we covered the miles of primeval forest and hill until the wooded ascent checked it .
the country bore an aspect more than usually sinister as we viewed it by night and without the accustomed crowds of investigators , so that we were often tempted to use the acetylene headlight despite the attention it might attract .
it was not a wholesome landscape after dark , and i believe i would have noticed its morbidity even had i been ignorant of the terror that stalked there .
of wild creatures there were none they are wise when death leers close .
the ancient trees seemed unnaturally large and twisted , and the other vegetation unnaturally thick and feverish , while curious mounds and hummocks in the weedy , earth reminded me of snakes and dead men skulls swelled to gigantic proportions .
fear had lurked on tempest mountain for more than a century .
this i learned at once from newspaper accounts of the catastrophe which first brought the region to the world notice .
the place is a remote , lonely elevation in that part of the catskills where dutch civilization once feebly and transiently penetrated , leaving behind as it receded only a few mined mansions and a degenerate squatter population inhabiting pitiful hamlets on isolated slopes .
normal beings seldom visited the locality till the state police were formed , and even now only infrequent troopers patrol it .
the fear , however , is an old tradition throughout the neighboring villages ; since it is a prime topic in the simple discourse of the poor mongrels who sometimes leave their valleys to trade handwoven baskets for such primitive necessities as they can not shoot , raise , or make .
the lurking fear dwelt in the shunned and deserted martense mansion , which crowned the high but gradual eminence whose liability to frequent thunderstorms gave it the name of tempest mountain .
for over a hundred years the antique , stone house had been the subject of stories incredibly wild and monstrously hideous ; stories of a silent colossal creeping death which stalked abroad in summer .
with whimpering insistence the squatters told tales of a demon which seized lone wayfarers after dark , either carrying them off or leaving them in a frightful state of gnawed dismemberment ; while sometimes they whispered of blood trails toward the distant mansion .
some said the thunder called the lurking fear out of its habitation , while others said the thunder was its voice .
no one outside the backwoods had believed these varying and conflicting stories , with their incoherent , extravagant descriptions of the fiend ; yet not a farmer or villager doubted that the martense mansion was ghoulishly haunted .
local history forbade such a doubt , although no ghostly evidence was ever found by such investigators as had visited the building after some especially vivid tale of the squatters .
grandmothers told strange myths of the martense spectre ; myths concerning the martense family itself , its queer hereditary dissimilarity of eyes , its long , unnatural annals , and the murder which had cursed it .
the terror which brought me to the scene was a sudden and portentous confirmation of the mountaineers ' wildest legends .
one summer night , after a thunderstorm of unprecedented violence , the countryside was aroused by a squatter stampede which no mere delusion could create .
the pitiful throngs of natives shrieked and whined of the unnamable horror which had descended upon them , and they were not doubted .
they had not seen it , but had heard such cries from one of their hamlets that they knew a creeping death had come .
in the morning citizens and state troopers followed the shuddering mountaineers to the place where they said the death had come .
death was indeed there .
the ground under one of the squatter villages had caved in after a lightning stroke , destroying several of the malodorous shanties ; but upon this property damage was superimposed an organic devastation which paled it to insignificance .
of a possible natives who had inhabited this spot , not one living specimen was visible .
the disordered earth was covered with blood and human debris bespeaking too vividly the ravages of demon teeth and talons ; yet no visible trail led away from the carnage .
that some hideous animal must be the cause , everyone quickly agreed ; nor did any tongue now revive the charge that such cryptic deaths formed merely the sordid murders common in decadent communities .
that charge was revived only when about of the estimated population were found missing from the dead ; and even then it was hard to explain the murder of fifty by half that number .
but the fact remained that on a summer night a bolt had come out of the heavens and left a dead village whose corpses were horribly mangled , chewed , and clawed .
the excited countryside immediately connected the horror with the haunted martense mansion , though the localities were over three miles apart .
the troopers were more skeptical ; including the mansion only casually in their investigations , and dropping it altogether when they found it thoroughly deserted .
country and village people , however i canvassed the place with infinite care ; overturning everything in the house , sounding ponds and brooks , beating down bushes , and ransacking the nearby forests .
all was in vain ; the death that had come had left no trace save destruction itself .
by the second day of the search the affair was fully treated by the newspapers , whose reporters overran tempest mountain .
they described it in much detail , and with many interviews to elucidate the horror history as told by local grandams .
i followed the accounts languidly at first , for i am a connoisseur in horrors ; but after a week i detected an atmosphere which stirred me oddly , so that on august , , i registered among the reporters who crowded the hotel at lefferts corners , nearest village to tempest mountain and acknowledged headquarters of the searchers .
three weeks more , and the dispersal of the reporters left me free to begin a terrible exploration based on the minute inquiries and surveying with which i had meanwhile busied myself .
so on this summer night , while distant thunder rumbled , i left a silent and tramped with two armed companions up the last reaches of tempest mountain , casting the beams of an electric torch on the spectral grey walls that began to appear through giant oaks ahead .
in this morbid night solitude and feeble shifting illumination , the vast boxlike pile displayed obscure hints of terror which day could not uncover ; yet i did not hesitate , since i had come with fierce resolution to test an idea .
i believed that the thunder called the out of some fearsome secret place ; and be that demon solid entity or vaporous pestilence , i meant to see it .
i had thoroughly searched the ruin before , hence knew my plan well ; choosing as the seat of my vigil the old room of jan martense , whose murder looms so great in the rural legends .
i felt subtly that the apartment of this ancient victim was best for my purposes .
the chamber , measuring about twenty feet square , contained like the other rooms some rubbish which had once been furniture .
it lay on the second story , on the southeast corner of the house , and had an immense east window and narrow south window , both devoid of panes or shutters .
opposite the large window was an enormous dutch fireplace with scriptural tiles representing the prodigal son , and opposite the narrow window was a spacious bed built into the wall .
as the thunder grew louder , i arranged my plan details .
first i fastened side by side to the ledge of the large window three rope ladders which i had brought with me .
i knew they reached a suitable spot on the grass outside , for i had tested them .
then the three of us dragged from another room a wide bedstead , crowding it laterally against the window .
having strewn it with fir boughs , all now rested on it with drawn automatics , two relaxing while the third watched .
from whatever direction the demon might come , our potential escape was provided .
if it came from within the house , we had the window ladders ; if from outside the door and the stairs .
we did not think , judging from precedent , that it would pursue us far even at worst .
i watched from midnight to one , when in spite of the sinister house , the unprotected window , and the approaching thunder and lightning , i felt singularly drowsy .
i was between my two companions , george bennett being toward the window and william tobey toward the fireplace .
bennett was asleep , having apparently felt the same anomalous drowsiness which affected me , so i designated tobey for the next watch although even he was nodding .
it is curious how intently i had been watching the fireplace .
the increasing thunder must have affected my dreams , for in the brief time i slept there came to me apocalyptic visions .
once i partly awaked , probably because the sleeper toward the window had restlessly flung an arm across my chest .
i was not sufficiently awake to see whether tobey was attending to his duties as sentinel , but felt a distinct anxiety on that score .
never before had the presence of evil so poignantly oppressed me .
later i must have dropped asleep again , for it was out of a phantasmal chaos that my mind leaped when the night grew hideous with shrieks beyond anything in my former experience or imagination .
in that shrieking the inmost soul of human fear and agony clawed hopelessly and insanely at the ebony gates of oblivion .
i awoke to red madness and the mockery of diabolism , as farther and farther down inconceivable vistas that phobic and crystalline anguish retreated and reverberated .
there was no light , but i knew from the empty space at my right that tobey was gone , god alone knew whither .
across my chest still lay the heavy arm of the sleeper at my left .
then came the devastating stroke of lightning which shook the whole mountain , lit the darkest crypts of the hoary grove , and splintered the patriarch of the twisted trees .
in the demon flash of a monstrous fireball the sleeper started up suddenly while the glare from beyond the window threw his shadow vividly upon the chimney above the fireplace from which my eyes had never strayed .
that i am still alive and sane , is a marvel i can not fathom .
i can not fathom it , for the shadow on that chimney was not that of george bennett or of any other human creature , but a blasphemous abnormality from hell nethermost craters ; a nameless , shapeless abomination which no mind could fully grasp and no pen even partly describe .
in another second i was alone in the accursed mansion , shivering and gibbering .
george bennett and william tobey had left no trace , not even of a struggle .
they were never heard of again .
.
a passer in the storm for days after that hideous experience in the mansion i lay nervously exhausted in my hotel room at lefferts corners .
i do not remember exactly how i managed to reach the , start it , and slip unobserved back to the village ; for i retain no distinct impression save of titan trees , demoniac mutterings of thunder , and charonian shadows athwart the low mounds that dotted and streaked the region .
as i shivered and brooded on the casting of that shadow , i knew that i had at last pried out one of earth supreme horrors one of those nameless blights of outer voids whose faint demon scratchings we sometimes hear on the farthest rim of space , yet from which our own finite vision has given us a merciful immunity .
the shadow i had seen , i hardly dared to analyse or identify .
something had lain between me and the window that night , but i shuddered whenever i could not cast off the instinct to classify it .
if it had only snarled , or bayed , or laughed titteringly even that would have relieved the abysmal hideousness .
but it was so silent .
it had rested a heavy arm or foreleg on my chest obviously it was organic , or had once been organic jan martense , whose room i had invaded , was buried in the near the mansion i must find bennett and tobey , if they lived why had it picked them , and left me for the last ? drowsiness is so stifling , and dreams are so horrible
in a short time i realised that i must tell my story to someone or break down completely .
i had already decided not to abandon the quest for the lurking fear , for in my rash ignorance it seemed to me that uncertainty was worse than enlightenment , however terrible the latter might prove to be .
accordingly i resolved in my mind the best course to pursue ; whom to select for my confidences , and how to track down the thing which had obliterated two men and cast a nightmare shadow .
my chief acquaintances at lefferts corners had been the affable reporters , of whom several had still remained to collect final echoes of the tragedy .
it was from these that i determined to choose a colleague , and the more i reflected the more my preference inclined toward one arthur munroe , a dark , lean man of about , whose education , taste , intelligence , and temperament all seemed to mark him as one not bound to conventional ideas and experiences .
on an afternoon in early september , arthur munroe listened to my story .
i saw from the beginning that he was both interested and sympathetic , and when i had finished he analysed and discussed the thing with the greatest shrewdness and judgement .
his advice , moreover , was eminently practical ; for he recommended a postponement of operations at the martense mansion until we might become fortified with more detailed historical and geographical data .
on his initiative we combed the countryside for information regarding the terrible martense family , and discovered a man who possessed a marvelously illuminating ancestral diary .
we also talked at length with such of the mountain mongrels as had not fled from the terror and confusion to remoter slopes , and slope again scanned for dens and caves , but all without result .
and yet , as i have said , vague new fears hovered menacingly over us ; as if giant gryphons looked on transcosmic gulfs .
as the afternoon advanced , it became increasingly difficult to see ; and we heard the rumble of a thunderstorm gathering over tempest mountain .
this sound in such a locality naturally stirred us , though less than it would have done at night .
as it was , we hoped desperately that the storm would last until well after dark ; and with that hope turned from our aimless hillside searching toward the nearest inhabited hamlet to gather a body of squatters as helpers in the investigation .
timid as they were , a few of the younger men were sufficiently inspired by our protective leadership to promise such help .
we had hardly more than turned , however , when there descended such a blinding sheet of torrential rain that shelter became imperative .
the extreme , almost nocturnal darkness of the sky caused us to stumble badly , but guided by the frequent flashes of lightning and by our minute knowledge of the hamlet we soon reached the least porous cabin of the lot ; an heterogeneous combination of logs and boards whose still existing door and single tiny window both faced maple hill .
barring the door after us against the fury of the wind and rain , we put in place the crude window shutter which our frequent searches had taught us where to find .
it was dismal sitting there on rickety boxes in the pitchy darkness , but we smoked pipes and occasionally flashed our pocket lamps about .
now and then we could see the lightning through cracks in the wall ; the afternoon was so incredibly dark that each flash was extremely vivid .
the stormy vigil reminded me shudderingly of my ghastly night on tempest mountain .
my mind turned to that odd question which had kept recurring ever since the nightmare thing had happened ; and again i wondered why the demon , approaching the three watchers either from the window or the interior , had begun with the men on each side and left the middle man till the last , when the titan fireball had scared it away .
why had it not taken its victims in natural order , with myself second , from whichever direction it had approached ?
with what manner of tentacles did it prey ?
or did it know that i was the leader , and saved me for a fate worse than that of my companions ?
in the midst of these reflections , as if dramatically arranged to intensify them , there fell nearby a terrific bolt of lightning followed by the sound of sliding earth .
at the same time the wolfish wind rose to demoniac crescendos of ululation .
we were sure that the one tree on maple hill had been struck again , and munroe rose from his box and went to the tiny window to ascertain the damage .
when he took down the shutter the wind , and rain howled deafeningly in , so that i could not hear what he said ; but i waited while he leaned out and tried to fathom nature pandemonium .
gradually a calming of the wind and dispersal of the unusual darkness told of the storm passing .
i had hoped it would last into the night to help our quest , but a furtive sunbeam from a knothole behind me removed the likelihood of such a thing .
suggesting to munroe that we had better get some light even if more showers came , i unbarred and opened the crude door .
the ground outside was a singular mass of mud and pools , with fresh heaps of earth from the slight landslide ; but i saw nothing to justify the interest which kept my companion silently leaning out the window .
crossing to where he leaned , i touched his shoulder ; but he did not move .
then , as i playfully shook him and turned him around , i felt the strangling tendrils of a cancerous horror whose roots reached into illimitable pasts and fathomless abysms of the night that broods beyond time .
for arthur munroe was dead .
and on what remained of his chewed and gouged head there was no longer a face .
.
what the red glare meant on the night of november , , with a lantern which cast charnel shadows , i stood digging alone and idiotically in the grave of jan martense .
i had begun to dig in the afternoon , because a thunderstorm was brewing , and now that it was dark and the storm had burst above the maniacally thick foliage i was glad .
i believe that my mind was partly unhinged by events since august ; the demon shadow in the mansion , the general strain and disappointment , and the thing that occurred at the hamlet in an october storm .
after that thing i had dug a grave for one whose death i could not understand .
i knew that others could not understand either , so let them think arthur munroe had wandered away .
they searched , but found nothing .
the squatters might have understood , but i dared not frighten them more .
i myself seemed strangely callous .
that shock at the mansion had done something to my brain , and i could think only of the quest for a horror now grown to cataclysmic stature in my imagination ; a quest which the fate of arthur munroe made me vow to keep silent and solitary .
the scene of my excavations would alone have been enough to unnerve any ordinary man .
baleful primal trees of unholy size , age , and grotesqueness leered above me like the pillars of some hellish druidic temple ; muffling the thunder , hushing the clawing wind , and admitting but little rain .
beyond the scarred trunks in the background , illumined by faint flashes of filtered lightning , rose the damp ivied stones of the deserted mansion , while somewhat nearer was the abandoned dutch garden whose walks and beds were polluted by a white , fungous , foetid , vegetation that never saw full daylight .
and nearest of all was the graveyard , where deformed trees tossed insane branches as their roots displaced unhallowed slabs and sucked venom from what lay below .
now and then , beneath the brown pall of leaves that rotted and festered in the antediluvian forest darkness , i could trace the sinister outlines of some of those low mounds which characterized the region .
history had led me to this archaic grave .
history , indeed , was all i had after everything else ended in mocking satanism .
i now believed that the lurking fear was no material being , but a ghost that rode the midnight lightning .
and i believed , because of the masses of local tradition i had unearthed in search with arthur munroe , that the ghost was that of jan martense , who died in .
this is why i was digging idiotically in his grave .
the martense mansion was built in by gerrit martense , a wealthy merchant who disliked the changing order under british rule , and had constructed this magnificent domicile on a remote woodland summit whose untrodden solitude and unusual scenery pleased him .
the only substantial disappointment encountered in this site was that which concerned the prevalence of violent thunderstorms in summer .
when selecting the hill and building his mansion , mynheer martense had laid these frequent natural outbursts to some peculiarity of the year ; but in time he perceived that the locality was especially liable to such phenomena .
at length , having found these storms injurious to his head , he fitted up a cellar into which he could retreat from their wildest pandemonium .
of gerrit martense descendants less is known than of himself ; since they were all reared in hatred of the english civilisation , and trained to shun such of the colonists as accepted it .
their life was exceedingly secluded , and people declared that their isolation had made them heavy of speech and comprehension .
in appearance all were marked by a peculiar inherited dissimilarity of eyes ; one generally being blue and the other brown .
their social contacts grew fewer and fewer , till at last they took to intermarrying with the numerous menial class about the estate .
many of the crowded family degenerated , moved across the valley , and merged with the mongrel population which was later to produce the pitiful squatters .
the rest had stuck sullenly to their ancestral mansion , becoming more and more clannish and taciturn , yet developing a nervous responsiveness to the frequent thunderstorms .
most of this information reached the outside world through young jan martense , who from some kind of restlessness joined the colonial army when news of the albany convention reached tempest mountain .
he was the first of gerrit descendants to see much of the world ; and when he returned in after six years of campaigning , he was hated as an outsider by his father , uncles , and brothers , in spite of his dissimilar martense eyes .
no longer could he share the peculiarities and prejudices of the martenses , while the very mountain thunderstorms failed to intoxicate him as they had before .
instead , his surroundings depressed him ; and he frequently wrote to a friend in albany of plans to leave the paternal roof .
in the spring of jonathan gifford , the albany friend of jan martense , became worried by his correspondent silence ; especially in view of the conditions and quarrels at the martense mansion .
determined to visit jan in person , he went into the mountains on horseback .
his diary states that he reached tempest mountain on september , finding the mansion in great decrepitude .
the sullen , martenses , whose unclean animal aspect shocked him , told him in broken gutterals that jan was dead .
he had , they insisted , been struck by lightning the autumn before ; and now lay buried behind the neglected sunken gardens .
they showed the visitor the grave , barren and devoid of markers .
something in the martenses ' manner gave gifford a feeling of repulsion and suspicion , and a week later he returned with spade and mattock to explore the sepulchral spot .
he found what he expected a skull crushed cruelly as if by savage blows so returning to albany he openly charged the martenses with the murder of their kinsman .
legal evidence was lacking , but the story spread rapidly round the countryside ; and from that time the martenses were ostracised by the world .
no one would deal with them , and their distant manor was shunned as an accursed place .
somehow they managed to live on independently by the product of their estate , for occasional lights glimpsed from hills attested their continued presence .
these lights were seen as late as , but toward the last they became very infrequent .
meanwhile there grew up about the mansion and the mountain a body of diabolic legendry .
the place was avoided with doubled assiduousness , and invested with every whispered myth tradition could supply .
it remained unvisited till , when the continued absence of lights was noticed by the squatters .
at that time a party made investigations , finding the house deserted and partly in ruins .
there were no skeletons about , so that departure rather than death was inferred .
the clan seemed to have left several years before , and improvised penthouses showed how numerous it had grown prior to its migration .
its cultural level had fallen very low , as proved by decaying furniture and scattered silverware which must have been long abandoned when its owners left .
but though the dreaded martenses were gone , the fear of the haunted house continued ; and grew very acute when new and strange stories arose among the mountain decadents .
there it stood ; deserted , feared , and linked with the vengeful ghost of jan martense .
there it still stood on the night i dug in jan martense grave .
i have described my protracted digging as idiotic , and such it indeed was in object and method .
the coffin of jan martense had soon been unearthed it now held only dust and nitre but in my fury to exhume his ghost i delved irrationally and clumsily down beneath where he had lain .
god knows what i expected to find i only felt that i was digging in the grave of a man whose ghost stalked by night .
it is impossible to say what monstrous depth i had attained when my spade , and soon my feet , broke through the ground beneath .
the event , under the circumstances , was tremendous ; for in the existence of a subterranean space here , my mad theories had terrible confirmation .
my slight fall had extinguished the lantern , but i produced an electric pocket lamp and viewed the small horizontal tunnel which led away indefinitely in both directions .
it was amply large enough for a man to wriggle through ; and though no sane person would have tried at that time , i forgot danger , reason , and cleanliness in my fever to unearth the lurking fear .
choosing the direction toward the house , i scrambled recklessly into the narrow burrow ; squirming ahead blindly and rapidly , and flashing but seldom the lamp i kept before me .
what language can describe the spectacle of a man lost in infinitely abysmal earth ; pawing , twisting , wheezing ; scrambling madly through sunken convolutions of immemorial blackness without an idea of time , safety , direction , or definite object ?
there is something hideous in it , but that is what i did .
i did it for so long that life faded to a far memory , and i became one with the moles and grubs of nighted depths .
indeed , it was only by accident that after interminable writhings i jarred my forgotten electric lamp alight , so that it shone eerily along the burrow of caked loam that stretched and curved ahead .
i had been scrambling in this way for some time , so that my battery had burned very low , when the passage suddenly inclined sharply upward , altering my mode of progress .
and as i raised my glance it was without preparation that i saw glistening in the distance two demoniac reflections of my expiring lamp ; two reflections glowing with a baneful and unmistakable effulgence , and provoking maddeningly nebulous memories .
i stopped automatically , though lacking the brain to retreat .
the eyes approached , yet of the thing that bore them i could distinguish only a claw .
but what a claw !
then far overhead i heard a faint crashing which i recognized .
it was the wild thunder of the mountain , raised to hysteric fury i must have been crawling upward for some time , so that the surface was now quite near .
and as the muffled thunder clattered , those eyes still stared with vacuous viciousness .
thank god i did not then know what it was , else i should have died .
but i was saved by the very thunder that had summoned it , for after a hideous wait there burst from the unseen outside sky one of those frequent mountainward bolts whose aftermath i had noticed here and there as gashes of disturbed earth and fulgurites of various sizes .
with cyclopean rage it tore through the soil above that damnable pit , blinding and deafening me , yet not wholly reducing me to a coma .
in the chaos of sliding , shifting earth i clawed and floundered helplessly till the rain on my head steadied me and i saw that i had come to the surface in a familiar spot ; a steep unforested place on the southwest slope of the mountain .
recurrent sheet lightnings illumed the tumbled ground and the remains of the curious low hummock which had stretched down from the wooded higher slope , but there was nothing in the chaos to show my place of egress from the lethal catacomb .
my brain was as great a chaos as the earth , and as a distant red glare burst on the landscape from the south i hardly realised the horror i had been through .
but when two days later the squatters told me what the red glare meant , i felt more horror than that which the and the claw and eyes had given ; more horror because of the overwhelming implications .
in a hamlet twenty miles away an orgy of fear had followed the bolt which brought me above ground , and a nameless thing had dropped from an overhanging tree into a cabin .
it had done a deed , but the squatters had fired the cabin in frenzy before it could escape .
it had been doing that deed at the very moment the earth caved in on the thing with the claw and eyes .
.
the horror in the eyes there can be nothing normal in the mind of one who , knowing what i knew of the horrors of tempest mountain , would seek alone for the fear that lurked there .
that at least two of the fear embodiments were destroyed , formed but a slight guarantee of mental and physical safety in this acheron of multiform diabolism ; yet i continued my quest with even greater zeal as events and revelations became more monstrous .
when , two days after my frightful crawl through that crypt of the eyes and claw , i learned that a thing had malignly hovered twenty miles away at the same instant the eyes were glaring at me , i experienced virtual convulsions of fright .
but that fright was so mixed with wonder and alluring grotesqueness , that it was almost a pleasant sensation .
sometimes , in the throes of a nightmare when unseen powers whirl one over the roofs of strange dead cities toward the grinning chasm of nis , it is a relief and even a delight to shriek wildly and throw oneself voluntarily along with the hideous vortex of into whatever bottomless gulf may yawn .
and so it was with the walking nightmare of tempest mountain ; the discovery that two monsters had haunted the spot gave me ultimately a mad craving to plunge into the very earth of the accursed region , and with bare hands dig out the death that leered from every inch of the poisonous soil .
as soon as possible i visited the grave of jan martense and dug vainly where i had dug before .
some extensive had obliterated all trace of the underground passage , while the rain had washed so much earth back into the excavation that i could not tell how deeply i had dug that other day .
i likewise made a difficult trip to the distant hamlet where the had been burnt , and was little repaid for my trouble .
in the ashes of the fateful cabin i found several bones , but apparently none of the monster .
the squatters said the thing had had only one victim ; but in this i judged them inaccurate , since besides the complete skull of a human being , there was another bony fragment which seemed certainly to have belonged to a human skull at some time .
though the rapid drop of the monster had been seen , no one could say just what the creature was like ; those who had glimpsed it called it simply a devil .
examining the great tree where it had lurked , i could discern no distinctive marks .
i tried to find some trail into the black forest , but on this occasion could not stand the sight of those morbidly large boles , or of those vast roots that twisted so malevolently before they sank into the earth .
my next step was to reexamine with microscopic care the deserted hamlet where death had come most abundantly , and where arthur munroe had seen something he never lived to describe .
though my vain previous searches had been exceedingly minute , i now had new data to test ; for my horrible convinced me that at least one of the phases of the monstrosity had been an underground creature .
this time , on the of november , my quest concerned itself mostly with the slopes of cone mountain and maple hill where they overlook the unfortunate hamlet , and i gave particular attention to the loose earth of the landslide region on the latter eminence .
the afternoon of my search brought nothing to light , and dusk came as i stood on maple hill looking down at the hamlet and across the valley to tempest mountain .
there had been a gorgeous sunset , and now the moon came up , nearly full and shedding a silver flood over the plain , the distant mountainside , and the curious low mounds that rose here and there .
it was a peaceful arcadian scene , but knowing what it hid i hated it .
i hated the mocking moon , the hypocritical plain , the festering mountain , and those sinister mounds .
everything seemed to me tainted with a loathsome contagion , and inspired by a noxious alliance with distorted hidden powers .
presently , as i gazed abstractedly at the moonlit panorama , my eye became attracted by something singular in the nature and arrangement of a certain topographical element .
without having any exact knowledge of geology , i had from the first been interested in the odd mounds and hummocks of the region .
i had noticed that they were pretty widely distributed around tempest mountain , though less numerous on the plain than near the hilltop itself , where prehistoric glaciation had doubtless found feebler opposition to its striking and fantastic caprices .
now , in the light of that low moon which cast long weird shadows , it struck me forcibly that the various points and lines of the mound system had a peculiar relation to the summit of tempest mountain .
that summit was undeniably a centre from which the lines or rows of points radiated indefinitely and irregularly , as if the unwholesome martense mansion had thrown visible tentacles of terror .
the idea of such tentacles gave me an unexplained thrill , and i stopped to analyse my reason for believing these mounds glacial phenomena .
the more i analysed the less i believed , and against my newly opened mind there began to beat grotesque and horrible analogies based on superficial aspects and upon my experience beneath the earth .
before i knew it i was uttering frenzied and disjointed words to myself ; my god ! molehills the damned place must be honeycombed how many that night at the mansion they took bennett and tobey first on each side of us then i was digging frantically into the mound which had stretched nearest me ; digging desperately , shiveringly , but almost jubilantly ; digging and at last shrieking aloud with some unplaced emotion as i came upon a tunnel or burrow just like the one through which i had crawled on the other demoniac night .
after that i recall running , spade in hand ; a hideous run across moon litten , meadows and through diseased , precipitous abysses of haunted hillside forest ; leaping screaming , panting , bounding toward the terrible martense mansion .
i recall digging unreasonably in all parts of the cellar ; digging to find the core and centre of that malignant universe of mounds .
and then i recall how i laughed when i stumbled on the passageway ; the hole at the base of the old chimney , where the thick weeds grew and cast queer shadows in the light of the lone candle i had happened to have with me .
what still remained down in that , lurking and waiting for the thunder to arouse it , i did not know .
two had been killed ; perhaps that had finished it .
but still there remained that burning determination to reach the innermost secret of the fear , which i had once more come to deem definite , material , and organic .
my indecisive speculation whether to explore the passage alone and immediately with my or to try to assemble a band of squatters for the quest , was interrupted after a time by a sudden rush of wind from the outside which blew out the candle and left me in stark blackness .
the moon no longer shone through the chinks and apertures above me , and with a sense of fateful alarm i heard the sinister and significant rumble of approaching thunder .
a confusion of associated ideas possessed my brain , leading me to grope back toward the farthest corner of the cellar .
my eyes , however , never turned away from the horrible opening at the base of the chimney ; and i began to get glimpses of the crumbling bricks and unhealthy weeds as faint glows of lightning penetrated the weeds outside and illumined the chinks in the upper wall .
every second i was consumed with a mixture of fear and curiosity .
