content you , gentlemen i will compound this strife is deeds must win the prize , and he of both that can assure my daughter greatest dower shall have my bianca love .
say , signior gremio , what can you assure her ?
first , as you know , my house within the city is richly furnished with plate and gold , basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands , my hangings all of tyrian tapestry , in ivory coffers i have stuff my crowns , in cypress chests my arras counterpoints , costly apparel , tents , and canopies , fine linen , turkey cushions boss with pearl , valance of venice gold in needlework , pewter and brass and all things that belong to house or housekeeping then , at my farm i have a hundred to the pail , sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls , and all things answerable to this portion .
myself am struck in years , i must confess , and if i die , this is hers , if whilst i live she will be only mine .
that ' came well in .
sir , list to me i am my father heir and only son if i may have your daughter to my wife , i leave her houses three or four as good , within rich pisa walls , as any one old signior gremio has in padua , besides two thousand ducats by the year of fruitful land , all which shall be her jointure .
what , have i pinch you , signior gremio ?
two thousand ducats by the year of land !
my land amounts not to so much in all that she shall have , besides an argosy that now is lying in marseilles ' road .
what , have i choked you with an argosy ?
gremio , is known my father hath no less than three great argosies , besides two galliases , and twelve tight galleys these i will assure her , and twice as much , thou next .
nay , i have offer all , i have no more , and she can have no more than all i have if you like me , she shall have me and mine .

that katharina and petruchio should be married , and yet we hear not of our .
what will be said ?
what mockery will it be , to want the bridegroom when the priest attends to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage !
what says lucentio to this shame of ours ?
no shame but mine i must , forsooth , be forced to give my hand opposed against my heart unto a rudesby full of spleen , who woo in haste and means to wed at leisure .
i told you , i , he was a frantic fool , hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior and , to be noted for a merry man , he woo a thousand , the day of marriage , make feasts , invite friends , and proclaim the banns , yet never means to wed where he hath woo .
now must the world point at poor katharina , and say , , there is mad petruchio wife , if it would please him come and marry her ! '
patience , good katharina , and baptista too .
upon my life , petruchio means but well , whatever fortune stays him from his word though he be blunt , i know him passing wise , though he be merry , yet withal he honest .
would katharina had never seen him though !

is it new and old too ?
how may that be ?
why , is it not news , to hear of petruchio coming ?
is he come ?
why , no , sir .
what then ?
he is coming .
when will he be here ?
when he stands where i am and sees you there .
but say , what to thine old news ?
why , petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old jerkin , a pair of old breeches thrice turned , a pair of boots that have been , one buckled , another laced , an old rusty sword out of the , with a broken hilt , and chapeless , with two broken points his horse hipped with an old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred , besides , possessed with the glanders and like to mose in the chine , troubled with the lampass , infected with the fashions , full of wingdalls , sped with spavins , rayed with yellows , past cure of the fives , stark spoiled with the staggers , begnawn with the bots , swayed in the back and , before and with , a bit and a of sheeps leather which , being restrained to keep him from stumbling , hath been often burst and now repaired with knots , one girth six time pieced and a woman crupper of velure , which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs , and here and there pieced with packthread .
who comes with him ?
o , sir , his lackey , for all the world caparisoned like the horse , with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey on the other , gartered with a red and blue list , an old hat and humour of forty fancies ' pricked i for a feather a monster , a very monster in apparel , and not like a christian footboy or a gentleman lackey .
is some odd humour pricks him to this fashion , yet oftentimes he goes but .
i am glad he come , he comes .
why , sir , he comes not .
didst thou not say he comes ?
who ?
that petruchio came ?
ay , that petruchio came .
no , sir , i say his horse comes , with him on his back .
why , that all one .
nay , by saint jamy , i hold you a penny , a horse and a man is more than one , and yet not many .
enter petruchio and grumio come , where be these gallants ?
who at home ?
you are welcome , sir .
and yet i come not well .
and yet you halt not .
not so well apparell as i wish you were .
were it better , i should rush in thus .
but where is kate ?
where is my lovely bride ?
how does my father ?
gentles , methinks you frown and wherefore gaze this goodly company , as if they saw some wondrous monument , some comet or unusual prodigy ?
why , sir , you know this is your first were we sad , fearing you would not come , now sadder , that you come so unprovided .
fie , doff this habit , shame to your estate , an to our solemn festival !
and tells us , what occasion of import hath all so long detain you from your wife , and sent you hither so unlike yourself ?
tedious it were to tell , and harsh to hear sufficeth i am come to keep my word , though in some part enforced to digress , which , at more leisure , i will so excuse as you shall well be satisfied withal .
but where is kate ?
i stay too long from her the morning wears , is time we were at church .
see not your bride in these unreverent robes go to my chamber , put on clothes of mine .
not i , believe me thus i visit her .
but thus , i trust , you will not marry her .
good sooth , even thus , therefore ha ' done with words to me she married , not unto my clothes could i repair what she will wear in me , as i can change these poor accoutrements , well for kate and better for myself .
but what a fool am i to chat with you , when i should bid good morrow to my bride , and seal the title with a lovely kiss !
exeunt petruchio and grumio he hath some meaning in his mad attire we will persuade him , be it possible , to put on better ere he go to church .
i after him , and see the event of this .
exeunt baptista , gremio , and attendants but to her love concerneth us to add her father liking which to bring to pass , as i before unparted to your worship , i am to get a man , he be , it skills not much .
we fit him to our turn , and he shall be vincentio of pisa , and make assurance here in padua of greater sums than i have promised .
so shall you quietly enjoy your hope , and marry sweet bianca with consent .
were it not that my doth watch bianca steps so narrowly , good , methinks , to steal our marriage , which once perform , let all the world say no , i keep mine own , despite of all the world .
that by degrees we mean to look into , and watch our vantage in this business we the greybeard , gremio , the father , minola , the quaint musician , amorous licio , all for my master sake , lucentio .
gremio signior gremio , came you from the church ?
as willingly as i came from school .
and is the bride and bridegroom coming home ?
a bridegroom say you ?
is a groom indeed , a grumbling groom , and that the girl shall find .
curster than she ?
why , is impossible .
why he a devil , a devil , a very fiend .
why , she a devil , a devil , the devil dam .
tut , she a lamb , a dove , a fool to him !
i tell you , sir lucentio when the priest should ask , if katharina should be his wife , , by , ' quoth he , and swore so loud , that , , the priest let fall the book , and , as he stoop again to take it up , the bridegroom took him such a cuff that down fell priest and book and book and priest take them up , ' quoth he , any list . '
what said the wench when he rose again ?
trembled and shook , for why , he stamp and swore , as if the vicar meant to cozen him .
but after many ceremonies done , he calls for wine ' a health ! '
quoth he , as if he had been aboard , carousing to his mates after a storm , quaff off the muscadel and threw the sops all in the sexton face , having no other reason but that his beard grew thin and hungerly and seem to ask him sops as he was drinking .
this done , he took the bride about the neck and kiss her lips with such a clamorous smack that at the parting all the church did echo and i seeing this came thence for very shame , and after me , i know , the rout is coming .
such a mad marriage never was before hark , hark !
i hear the minstrels play .
music petruchio , katharina , bianca , baptista , hortensio , grumio , and train gentlemen and friends , i thank you for your pains i know you think to dine with me , and have prepared great store of wedding cheer , but so it is , my haste doth call me hence , and therefore here i mean to take my leave .

away , you fool !
i am no beast .
am i but three inches ?
why , thy horn is a foot , and so long am i at the least .
but wilt thou make a fire , or shall i complain on thee to our mistress , whose hand , she being now at hand , thou shalt soon feel , to thy cold comfort , for being slow in thy hot office ?

and therefore is called a sensible tale and this cuff was but to knock at your ear , and beseech listening .
now i begin imprimis , we came down a foul hill , my master riding behind my mistress , both of one horse ?
what that to thee ?
why , a horse .
tell thou the tale but hadst thou not crossed me , thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she under her horse , thou shouldst have heard in how miry a place , how she was bemoiled , how he left her with the horse upon her , how he beat me because her horse stumbled , how she waded through the dirt to pluck him off me , how he swore , how she prayed , that never prayed before , how i cried , how the horses ran away , how her bridle was burst , how i lost my crupper , with many things of worthy memory , which now shall die in oblivion and thou return unexperienced to thy grave .
by this reckoning he is more shrew than she .
ay , and that thou and the proudest of you all shall find when he comes home .

what , do you grumble ?
i be with you straight .
i pray you , husband , be not so disquiet the meat was well , if you were so contented .
i tell thee , kate , was burnt and dried away , and i expressly am forbid to touch it , for it engenders choler , planteth anger , and better that both of us did fast , since , of ourselves , ourselves are choleric , than feed it with such flesh .
be patient , shall be mended , and , for this night , we fast for company come , i will bring thee to thy bridal chamber .
exeunt servants severally peter , didst ever see the like ?
he kills her in her own humour .
curtis where is he ?
in her chamber , making a sermon of continency to her , and rails , and swears , and rates , that she , poor soul , knows not which way to stand , to look , to speak , and sits as one from a dream .
away , away !
for he is coming hither .
exeunt petruchio thus have i politicly begun my reign , and is my hope to end successfully .
my falcon now is sharp and passing empty , and till she stoop she must not be , for then she never looks upon her lure .
another way i have to man my haggard , to make her come and know her keeper call , that is , to watch her , as we watch these kites that bate and beat and will not be obedient .
she eat no meat , nor none shall eat , last night she slept not , nor she shall not , as with the meat , some undeserved fault i find about the making of the bed , and here i fling the pillow , there the bolster , this way the coverlet , another way the sheets ay , and amid this hurly i intend that all is done in reverend care of her , and in conclusion she shall watch all night and if she chance to nod i rail and brawl and with the clamour keep her still awake .
this is a way to kill a wife with kindness , and thus i curb her mad and headstrong humour .
he that knows better how to tame a shrew , now let him speak is charity to show .

mistake no more i am not licio , nor a musician , as i seem to be , but one that scorn to live in this disguise , for such a one as leaves a gentleman , and makes a god of such a cullion know , sir , that i am call hortensio .
signior hortensio , i have often heard of your entire affection to bianca , and since mine eyes are witness of her lightness , i will with you , if you be so contented , forswear bianca and her love for ever .
see , how they kiss and court !
signior lucentio , here is my hand , and here i firmly vow never to woo her no more , but do forswear her , as one unworthy all the former favours that i have fondly flatter her withal .
and here i take the unfeigned oath , never to marry with her though she would entreat fie on her !
see , how beastly she doth court him !
would all the world but he had quite forsworn !
for me , that i may surely keep mine oath , i will be married to a wealthy widow , ere three days pass , which hath as long loved me as i have loved this proud disdainful haggard .
and so farewell , signior lucentio .
kindness in women , not their beauteous looks , shall win my love and so i take my leave , in resolution as i swore before .
exit mistress bianca , bless you with such grace as to a lover blessed case !
nay , i have you napping , gentle love , and have forsworn you with hortensio .
tranio , you jest but have you both forsworn me ?
mistress , we have .

or is the adder better than the eel , because his painted skin contents the eye ?
o , no , good kate , neither art thou the worse for this poor furniture and mean array .

bianca love made me exchange my state with tranio , while he did bear my countenance in the town , and happily i have arrived at the last unto the wished haven of my bliss .
what tranio did , myself enforced him to , then pardon him , sweet father , for my sake .
i slit the villain nose , that would have sent me to the gaol .

is that an answer ?
ay , and a kind one too pray god , sir , your wife send you not a worse .
i hope better .
sirrah biondello , go and entreat my wife to come to me forthwith .
exit biondello o , ho !

nay , then she must needs come .
i am afraid , sir , do what you can , yours will not be entreated .
biondello now , where my wife ?
she says you have some goodly jest in hand she will not come she bids you come to her .
worse and worse , she will not come !
o vile , intolerable , not to be endured !
sirrah grumio , go to your mistress , say , i command her to come to me .
exit grumio i know her answer .

she will not .
the fouler fortune mine , and there an end .
now , by my holidame , here comes katharina !
katarina what is your will , sir , that you send for me ?
where is your sister , and hortensio wife ?
they sit conferring by the parlor fire .
go fetch them hither if they deny to come .
swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands away , i say , and bring them hither straight .
exit katharina here is a wonder , if you talk of a wonder .
and so it is i wonder what it bodes .
marry , peace it bodes , and love and quiet life , and awful rule and right supremacy , and , to be short , what not , that sweet and happy ?
now , fair befal thee , good petruchio !
the wager thou hast won , and i will add unto their losses twenty thousand crowns , another dowry to another daughter , for she is changed , as she had never been .
nay , i will win my wager better yet and show more sign of her obedience , her virtue and obedience .
see where she comes and brings your froward wives as prisoners to her womanly persuasion .
katharina , with bianca and widow katharina , that cap of yours becomes you not off with that bauble , throw it .
lord , let me never have a cause to sigh , till i be brought to such a silly pass !
fie !
what a foolish duty call you this ?
i would your duty were as foolish too the wisdom of your duty , fair bianca , hath cost me an hundred crowns since .
the more fool you , for laying on my duty .
katharina , i charge thee , tell these headstrong women what duty they do owe their lords and husbands .
come , come , you mocking we will have no telling .
come on , i say , and first begin with her .
she shall not .
i say she shall and first begin with her .
fie , fie !
unknit that threatening unkind brow , and dart not scornful glances from those eyes , to wound thy lord , thy king , thy governor it blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads , confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds , and in no sense is meet or amiable .
a woman moved is like a fountain troubled , muddy , , thick , bereft of beauty , and while it is so , none so dry or thirsty will deign to sip or touch one drop of it .
thy husband is thy lord , thy life , thy keeper , thy head , thy sovereign , one that cares for thee , and for thy maintenance commits his body to painful labour both by sea and land , to watch the night in storms , the day in cold , whilst thou liest warm at home , secure and safe , and craves no other tribute at thy hands but love , fair looks and true obedience , too little payment for so great a debt .
such duty as the subject owes the prince even such a woman oweth to her husband , and when she is froward , peevish , sullen , sour , and not obedient to his honest will , what is she but a foul contending rebel and graceless traitor to her loving lord ?
i am ashamed that women are so simple to offer war where they should kneel for peace , or seek for rule , supremacy and sway , when they are bound to serve , love and obey .
why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth , unapt to toil and trouble in the world , but that our soft conditions and our hearts should well agree with our external parts ?
come , come , you froward and unable worms !
my mind hath been as big as one of yours , my heart as great , my reason haply more , to bandy word for word and frown for frown , but now i see our lances are but straws , our strength as weak , our weakness past compare , that seeming to be most which we indeed least are .
then vail your stomachs , for it is no boot , and place your hands below your husband foot in token of which duty , if he please , my hand is ready , may it do him ease .
why , there a wench !
come on , and kiss me , kate .
well , go thy ways , old lad , for thou shalt .
is a good hearing when children are toward .
but a harsh hearing when women are froward .
come , kate , we to bed .
we three are married , but you two are sped .
to lucentio was i won the wager , though you hit the white , and , being a winner , god give you good night !
exeunt petruchio and katharina now , go thy ways , thou hast tamed a curst shrew .
is a wonder , by your leave , she will be tamed so .
exeunt act i scene i .
on a ship at sea a tempestuous noise of thunder and lightning heard .
enter a master and a boatswain boatswain !
here , master what cheer ?
good , speak to the mariners fall , yarely , or we run ourselves aground bestir , bestir .
exit enter mariners heigh , my hearts !

where is the master , boatswain ?
do you not hear him ?
you mar our labour keep your cabins you do assist the storm .
nay , good , be patient .
when the sea is .
hence !
what cares these roarers for the name of king ?
to cabin silence !
trouble us not .
good , yet remember whom thou hast aboard .
none that i more love than myself .
you are a counsellor , if you can command these elements to silence , and work the peace of the present , we will not hand a rope more , use your authority if you can not , give thanks you have lived so long , and make yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of the hour , if it so hap .
cheerly , good hearts !
out of our way , i say .
exit i have great comfort from this fellow methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him , his complexion is perfect gallows .
stand fast , good fate , to his hanging make the rope of his destiny our cable , for our own doth little advantage .
if he be not born to be hanged , our case is miserable .
exeunt boatswain down with the topmast !
yare !
lower , lower !
bring her to try with .
a cry within a plague upon this howling !
they are louder than the weather or our office .
sebastian , antonio , and gonzalo yet again !
what do you here ?
shall we give and drown ?
have you a mind to sink ?
a pox o ' your throat , you bawling , blasphemous , incharitable dog !
work you then .
hang , cur !
hang , you whoreson , insolent noisemaker !
we are less afraid to be drowned than thou art .
i warrant him for drowning , though the ship were no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an unstanched wench .
lay her , !
set her two courses off to sea again , lay her off .
enter mariners wet all lost !
to prayers , to prayers !
all lost !
what , must our mouths be cold ?
the king and prince at prayers !
let assist them , for our case is as theirs .
i out of patience .
we are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards this rascal would thou mightst lie drowning the washing of ten tides !
he be hang yet , though every drop of water swear against it and gape at widest to glut him .
a confused noise within on us ! '
split , we split ! '
, my wife and children ! '
, brother ! '
split , we split , we split ! '
let all sink with the king .
let take leave of him .
exeunt antonio and sebastian now would i give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of barren ground , long heath , brown furze , any thing .
the wills above be done !
but i would fain die a dry death .
exeunt scene ii .
the island .
before prospero cell .
enter prospero and miranda if by your art , my dearest father , you have put the wild waters in this roar , allay them .
the sky , it seems , would pour down stinking pitch , but that the sea , mounting to the welkin cheek , dashes the fire out .
o , i have suffered with those that i saw suffer a brave vessel , who had , no doubt , some noble creature in her , dash all to pieces .
o , the cry did knock against my very heart .
poor souls , they perish .
had i been any god of power , i would have sunk the sea within the earth or ere it should the good ship so have swallow and the fraughting souls within her .
be collected no more amazement tell your piteous heart there no harm done .
o , woe the day !
no harm .
i have done nothing but in care of thee , of thee , my dear one , thee , my daughter , who art ignorant of what thou art , nought knowing of whence i am , nor that i am more better than prospero , master of a full poor cell , and thy no greater father .
more to know did never meddle with my thoughts .
is time i should inform thee farther .
lend thy hand , and pluck my magic garment from me .
so lays down his mantle lie there , my art .
wipe thou thine eyes , have comfort .
the direful spectacle of the wreck , which touch the very virtue of compassion in thee , i have with such provision in mine art so safely ordered that there is no soul no , not so much perdition as an hair betid to any creature in the vessel which thou cry , which thou sink .
sit down , for thou must now know farther .
you have often begun to tell me what i am , but stopp and left me to a bootless inquisition , concluding not yet . '
the hour now come , the very minute bids thee ope thine ear , obey and be attentive .
canst thou remember a time before we came unto this cell ?
i do not think thou canst , for then thou wast not out three years old .
certainly , sir , i can .
by what ?
by any other house or person ?
of any thing the image tell me that hath kept with thy remembrance .
is far off and rather like a dream than an assurance that my remembrance warrants .
had i not four or five women once that tended me ?
thou hadst , and more , miranda .
but how is it that this lives in thy mind ?
what seest thou else in the dark backward and abysm of time ?
if thou aught ere thou camest here , how thou camest here thou mayst .
but that i do not .
twelve year since , miranda , twelve year since , thy father was the duke of milan and a prince of power .
sir , are not you my father ?
thy mother was a piece of virtue , and she said thou wast my daughter , and thy father was duke of milan , and thou his only heir and princess no worse issued .
o the heavens !
what foul play had we , that we came from thence ?
or blessed we did ?
both , both , my girl by foul play , as thou , were we heaved thence , but blessedly holp hither .
o , my heart bleeds to think o ' the teen that i have turn you to , which is from my remembrance !
please you , farther .
my brother and thy uncle , call antonio i pray thee , mark me that a brother should be so perfidious ! he whom next thyself of all the world i loved and to him put the manage of my state , as at that time through all the signories it was the first and prospero the prime duke , being so reputed in dignity , and for the liberal arts without a parallel , those being all my study , the government i cast upon my brother and to my state grew stranger , being transported and rapt in secret studies .
thy false uncle dost thou attend me ?
sir , most heedfully .
being once perfected how to grant suits , how to deny them , who to advance and who to trash for , new created the creatures that were mine , i say , or changed , or else new form , having both the key of officer and office , set all hearts i ' the state to what tune pleased his ear , that now he was the ivy which had hid my princely trunk , and suck my verdure out o .
thou not .
o , good sir , i do .
i pray thee , mark me .
i , thus neglecting worldly ends , all dedicated to closeness and the bettering of my mind with that which , but by being so retired , all popular rate , in my false brother awaked an evil nature , and my trust , like a good parent , did beget of him a falsehood in its contrary as great as my trust was , which had indeed no limit , a confidence sans bound .
he being thus lorded , not only with what my revenue yielded , but what my power might else exact , like one who having into truth , by telling of it , made such a sinner of his memory , to credit his own lie , he did believe he was indeed the duke , out o ' the substitution and executing the outward face of royalty , with all prerogative hence his ambition growing dost thou hear ?
your tale , sir , would cure deafness .
to have no screen between this part he play and him he play it for , he needs will be absolute milan .
me , poor man , my library was dukedom large enough of temporal royalties he thinks me now incapable , confederates so dry he was for sway wi ' the king of naples to give him annual tribute , do him homage , subject his coronet to his crown and bend the dukedom yet unbow alas , poor milan ! to most ignoble stooping .
o the heavens !
mark his condition and the event , then tell me if this might be a brother .
i should sin to think but nobly of my grandmother good wombs have borne bad sons .
now the condition .
the king of naples , being an enemy to me inveterate , hearkens my brother suit , which was , that he , in lieu o ' the premises of homage and i know not how much tribute , should presently extirpate me and mine out of the dukedom and confer fair milan with all the honours on my brother whereon , a treacherous army levied , one midnight fated to the purpose did antonio open the gates of milan , and , i ' the dead of darkness , the ministers for the purpose hurried thence me and thy crying self .
alack , for pity !
i , not remembering how i cried out then , will cry it again it is a hint that wrings mine eyes .
hear a little further and then i bring thee to the present business which now upon , without the which this story were most impertinent .
wherefore did they not that hour destroy us ?
well demanded , wench my tale provokes that question .
dear , they durst not , so dear the love my people bore me , nor set a mark so bloody on the business , but with colours fairer painted their foul ends .
in few , they hurried us aboard a bark , bore us some leagues to sea , where they prepared a rotten carcass of a boat , not rigg , nor tackle , sail , nor mast , the very rats instinctively had quit it there they hoist us , to cry to the sea that roar to us , to sigh to the winds whose pity , sighing back again , did us but loving wrong .
alack , what trouble was i then to you !
o , a cherubim thou wast that did preserve me .
thou didst smile .
infused with a fortitude from heaven , when i have deck the sea with drops full salt , under my burthen groan , which raised in me an undergoing stomach , to bear up against what should ensue .
how came we ashore ?
by providence divine .
some food we had and some fresh water that a noble neapolitan , gonzalo , out of his charity , being then appointed master of this design , did give us , with rich garments , linens , stuffs and necessaries , which since have steaded much , so , of his gentleness , knowing i loved my books , he furnish me from mine own library with volumes that i prize above my dukedom .
would i might but ever see that man !
now i arise resumes his mantle sit still , and hear the last of our .
here in this island we arrived , and here have i , thy schoolmaster , made thee more profit than other princesses can that have more time for vainer hours and tutors not so careful .
heavens thank you !
and now , i pray you , sir , for still is beating in my mind , your reason for raising this ?
know thus far forth .
by accident most strange , bountiful fortune , now my dear lady , hath mine enemies brought to this shore , and by my prescience i find my zenith doth depend upon a most auspicious star , whose influence if now i court not but omit , my fortunes will ever after droop .
here cease more questions thou art inclined to sleep , is a good dulness , and give it way i know thou canst not choose .
miranda sleeps come away , servant , come .
i am ready now .
approach , my ariel , come .
enter ariel all hail , great master !
grave sir , hail !
i come to answer thy best pleasure , to fly , to swim , to dive into the fire , to ride on the curl clouds , to thy strong bidding task ariel and all his quality .
hast thou , spirit , perform to point the tempest that i bade thee ?
to every article .
i boarded the king ship , now on the beak , now in the waist , the deck , in every cabin , i flamed amazement sometime divide , and burn in many places , on the topmast , the yards and bowsprit , would i flame distinctly , then meet and join .
jove lightnings , the precursors o ' the dreadful , more momentary and were not , the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring the most mighty neptune seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble , yea , his dread trident shake .
my brave spirit !
who was so firm , so constant , that this coil would not infect his reason ?
not a soul but felt a fever of the mad and play some tricks of desperation .
all but mariners plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel , then all afire with me the king son , ferdinand , with hair , then like reeds , not hair , was the first man that leap , cried , is empty and all the devils are here . '
why that my spirit !
but was not this nigh shore ?
close by , my master .
but are they , ariel , safe ?
not a hair perish , on their sustaining garments not a blemish , but fresher than before and , as thou badest me , in troops i have dispersed them the isle .
the king son have i landed by himself , whom i left cooling of the air with sighs in an odd angle of the isle and sitting , his arms in this sad knot .
of the king ship the mariners say how thou hast disposed and all the rest o ' the fleet .
safely in harbour is the king ship , in the deep nook , where once thou me up at midnight to fetch dew from the bermoothes , there she hid the mariners all under hatches stow , who , with a charm join to their suffer labour , i have left asleep , and for the rest o ' the fleet which i dispersed , they all have met again and are upon the mediterranean flote , bound sadly home for naples , supposing that they saw the king ship wreck and his great person perish .
ariel , thy charge exactly is perform but there more work .
what is the time o ' the day ?
past the mid season .
at least two glasses .
the time six and now must by us both be spent most preciously .
is there more toil ?
since thou dost give me pains , let me remember thee what thou hast promised , which is not yet perform me .
how now ?
moody ?
what thou canst demand ?
my liberty .
before the time be out ?
no more !
i prithee , remember i have done thee worthy service , told thee no lies , made thee no mistakings , served without or grudge or grumblings thou didst promise to bate me a full year .
dost thou forget from what a torment i did free thee ?
no .
thou dost , and it much to tread the ooze of the salt deep , to run upon the sharp wind of the north , to do me business in the veins o ' the earth when it is baked with frost .
i do not , sir .
thou liest , malignant thing !
hast thou forgot the foul witch sycorax , who with age and envy was grown into a hoop ?
hast thou forgot her ?
no , sir .
thou hast .
where was she born ?
speak , tell me .
sir , in argier .
o , was she so ?
i must once in a month recount what thou hast been , which thou .
this damn witch sycorax , for mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible to enter human hearing , from argier , thou , was banish for one thing she did they would not take her life .
is not this true ?
ay , sir .
this hag was hither brought with child and here was left by the sailors .
thou , my slave , as thou thyself , wast then her servant , and , for thou wast a spirit too delicate to act her earthy and abhorr commands , refusing her grand hests , she did confine thee , by help of her more potent ministers and in her most unmitigable rage , into a cloven pine , within which rift imprison thou didst painfully remain a dozen years , within which space she died and left thee there , where thou didst vent thy groans as fast as strike .
then was this island save for the son that she did litter here , a freckled whelp not honour with a human shape .
yes , caliban her son .
dull thing , i say so , he , that caliban whom now i keep in service .
thou best what torment i did find thee in , thy groans did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts of ever angry bears it was a torment to lay upon the damn , which sycorax could not again undo it was mine art , when i arrived and heard thee , that made gape the pine and let thee out .
i thank thee , master .
if thou more , i will rend an oak and peg thee in his knotty entrails till thou hast howl away twelve winters .
pardon , master , i will be correspondent to command and do my spiriting gently .
do so , and after two days i will discharge thee .
that my noble master !
what shall i do ?
say what , what shall i do ?
go make thyself like a nymph o ' the sea be subject to no sight but thine and mine , invisible to every eyeball else .
go take this shape and hither come i go , hence with diligence !
exit ariel awake , dear heart , awake !
thou hast slept well , awake !
the strangeness of your story put heaviness in me .
shake it off .
come on , we visit caliban my slave , who never yields us kind answer .
is a villain , sir , i do not love to look on .
but , as is , we can not miss him he does make our fire , fetch in our wood and serves in offices that profit us .
what , ho !
slave !
caliban !
thou earth , thou !
speak .
within there wood enough within .
come forth , i say !
there other business for thee come , thou tortoise !
when ?
ariel like a fine apparition !
my quaint ariel , hark in thine ear .
my lord it shall be done .
exit thou poisonous slave , got by the devil himself upon thy wicked dam , come forth !
enter caliban as wicked dew as my mother brush with raven feather from unwholesome fen drop on you both !
a blow on ye and blister you all !
for this , be sure , thou shalt have cramps , that shall pen thy breath up , urchins shall , for that vast of night that they may work , all exercise on thee , thou shalt be pinch as thick as honeycomb , each pinch more stinging than bees that made .
i must eat my dinner .
this island mine , by sycorax my mother , which thou takest from me .
when thou camest first , thou strokedst me and madest much of me , wouldst give me water with berries i , and teach me how to name the bigger light , and how the less , that burn by day and night and then i loved thee and show thee all the qualities o ' the isle , the fresh springs , , barren place and fertile cursed be i that did so !
all the charms of sycorax , toads , beetles , bats , light on you !
for i am all the subjects that you have , which first was mine own king and here you sty me in this hard rock , whiles you do keep from me the rest o ' the island .
thou most lying slave , whom stripes may move , not kindness !
i have used thee , filth as thou art , with human care , and lodged thee in mine own cell , till thou didst seek to violate the honour of my child .
o ho , o ho !
had been done !
thou didst prevent me , i had peopled else this isle with calibans .
abhorred slave , which any print of goodness wilt not take , being capable of all ill !
i pitied thee , took pains to make thee speak , taught thee each hour one thing or other when thou didst not , savage , know thine own meaning , but wouldst gabble like a thing most brutish , i endow thy purposes with words that made them known .
but thy vile race , though thou didst learn , had that i which good natures could not abide to be with , therefore wast thou deservedly confined into this rock , who hadst deserved more than a prison .
you taught me language , and my profit o is , i know how to curse .
the red plague rid you for learning me your language !
, hence !
fetch us in fuel , and be quick , best , to answer other business .
thou , malice ?
if thou or dost unwillingly what i command , i rack thee with old cramps , fill all thy bones with aches , make thee roar that beasts shall tremble at thy din .
no , pray thee .
aside i must obey his art is of such power , it would control my dam god , setebos , and make a vassal of him .
so , slave , hence !
exit caliban ariel , invisible , playing and singing , ferdinand following ariel song .
come unto these yellow sands , and then take hands courtsied when you have and kiss the wild waves whist , foot it featly here and there , and , sweet sprites , the burthen bear .
hark , hark !
burthen dispersedly , within the bark !
burthen hark , hark !
i hear the strain of strutting chanticleer cry , .
where should this music be ?
i ' the air or the earth ?
it sounds no more and sure , it waits upon some god o ' the island .
sitting on a bank , weeping again the king my father wreck , this music crept by me upon the waters , allaying both their fury and my passion with its sweet air thence i have follow it , or it hath drawn me rather .
but is gone .
no , it begins again .
ariel sings full fathom five thy father lies , of his bones are coral made , those are pearls that were his eyes nothing of him that doth fade but doth suffer a into something rich and strange .
hourly ring his knell burthen hark !
now i hear them , , bell .
the ditty does remember my drown father .
this is no mortal business , nor no sound that the earth owes .
i hear it now above me .
the fringed curtains of thine eye advance and say what thou seest yond .
what ?
a spirit ?
lord , how it looks about !
believe me , sir , it carries a brave form .
but is a spirit .
no , wench , it eats and sleeps and hath such senses as we have , such .
this gallant which thou seest was in the wreck , and , but he something stain with grief that beauty canker , thou mightst call him a goodly person he hath lost his fellows and strays about to find .
i might call him a thing divine , for nothing natural i ever saw so noble .
aside it goes on , i see , as my soul prompts it .
spirit , fine spirit !
i free thee within two days for this .
most sure , the goddess on whom these airs attend !
vouchsafe my prayer may know if you remain upon this island , and that you will some good instruction give how i may bear me here my prime request , which i do last pronounce , is , o you wonder !
if you be maid or no ?
no wonder , sir , but certainly a maid .
my language !
heavens !
i am the best of them that speak this speech , were i but where is spoken .
how ?
the best ?
what wert thou , if the king of naples heard thee ?
a single thing , as i am now , that wonders to hear thee speak of naples .
he does hear me , and that he does i weep myself am naples , who with mine eyes , never since at ebb , beheld the king my father wreck .
alack , for mercy !
yes , faith , and all his lords , the duke of milan and his brave son being twain .
aside the duke of milan and his more braver daughter could control thee , if now fit to .
at the first sight they have changed eyes .
delicate ariel , i set thee free for this .
to ferdinand a word , good sir , i fear you have done yourself some wrong a word .
why speaks my father so ungently ?
this is the third man that i saw , the first that i sigh for pity move my father to be inclined my way !
o , if a virgin , and your affection not gone forth , i make you the queen of naples .
soft , sir !
one word more .
aside they are both in either powers , but this swift business i must uneasy make , lest too light winning make the prize light .
to ferdinand one word more , i charge thee that thou attend me thou dost here usurp the name thou owest not , and hast put thyself upon this island as a spy , to win it from me , the lord o .
no , as i am a man .
there nothing ill can dwell in such a temple if the ill spirit have so fair a house , good things will strive to dwell .
follow me .
speak not you for him , he a traitor .
come , i manacle thy neck and feet together shalt thou drink , thy food shall be the muscles , wither roots and husks wherein the acorn cradled .
follow .
no , i will resist such entertainment till mine enemy has more power .
draws , and is charmed from moving o dear father , make not too rash a trial of him , for he gentle and not fearful .
what ?
i say , my foot my tutor ?
put thy sword up , traitor , who makest a show but darest not strike , thy conscience is so possess with guilt come from thy ward , for i can here disarm thee with this stick and make thy weapon drop .
beseech you , father .
hence !
hang not on my garments .
sir , have pity , i be his surety .
silence !
one word more shall make me chide thee , if not hate thee .
what !
an advocate for an imposter !
hush !
thou there is no more such shapes as he , having seen but him and caliban foolish wench !
to the most of men this is a caliban and they to him are angels .
my affections are then most humble , i have no ambition to see a goodlier man .
come on , obey thy nerves are in their infancy again and have no vigour in them .
so they are , my spirits , as in a dream , are all bound up .
my father loss , the weakness which i feel , the wreck of all my friends , nor this man threats , to whom i am subdued , are but light to me , might i but through my prison once a day behold this maid all corners else o ' the earth let liberty make use of , space enough have i in such a prison .
aside it works .
to ferdinand come on .
thou hast done well , fine ariel !
to ferdinand follow me .
to ariel hark what thou else shalt do me .
be of comfort , my father of a better nature , sir , than he appears by speech this is unwonted which now came from him .
thou shalt be free as mountain winds but then exactly do all points of my command .
to the syllable .
come , follow .
speak not for him .
exeunt act ii scene i .
another part of the island .
enter alonso , sebastian , antonio , gonzalo , adrian , francisco , and others beseech you , sir , be merry , you have cause , so have we all , of joy , for our escape is much beyond our loss .
our hint of woe is common , every day some sailor wife , the masters of some merchant and the merchant have just our theme of woe , but for the miracle , i mean our preservation , few in millions can speak like us then wisely , good sir , weigh our sorrow with our comfort .
prithee , peace .
he receives comfort like cold porridge .
the visitor will not give him so .
look he winding up the watch of his wit , by and by it will strike .
sir , one tell .
when every grief is entertain that offer , comes to the entertainer a dollar .
dolour comes to him , indeed you have spoken truer than you purposed .
you have taken it wiselier than i meant you should .
therefore , my lord , fie , what a spendthrift is he of his tongue !
i prithee , spare .
well , i have done but yet , he will be talking .
which , of he or adrian , for a good wager , first begins to crow ?
the old cock .
the cockerel .
done .
the wager ?
a laughter .
a match !
though this island seem to be desert , ha , ha , ha !
so , you paid .
uninhabitable and almost inaccessible , yet , yet , he could not .
it must needs be of subtle , tender and delicate temperance .
temperance was a delicate wench .
ay , and a subtle , as he most learnedly delivered .
the air breathes upon us here most sweetly .
as if it had lungs and rotten ones .
or as perfumed by a fen .
here is everything advantageous to life .
true , save means to live .
of that there none , or little .
how lush and lusty the grass looks !
how green !
the ground indeed is tawny .
with an eye of green i .
he misses not much .
no , he doth but mistake the truth totally .
but the rarity of it is , which is indeed almost beyond credit , as many vouched rarities are .
that our garments , being , as they were , drenched in the sea , hold notwithstanding their freshness and glosses , being rather than stained with salt water .
if but one of his pockets could speak , would it not say he lies ?
ay , or very falsely pocket up his report methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we put them on first in afric , at the marriage of the king fair daughter claribel to the king of tunis .
was a sweet marriage , and we prosper well in our return .
tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to their queen .
not since widow dido time .
widow !
a pox o ' that !
how came that widow in ?
widow dido !
what if he had said aeneas ' too ?
good lord , how you take it !
dido ' said you ?
you make me study of that she was of carthage , not of tunis .
this tunis , sir , was carthage .
carthage ?
i assure you , carthage .
his word is more than the miraculous harp , he hath raised the wall and houses too .
what impossible matter will he make easy next ?
i think he will carry this island home in his pocket and give it his son for an apple .
and , sowing the kernels of it in the sea , bring forth more islands .
ay .
why , in good time .
sir , we were talking that our garments seem now as fresh as when we were at tunis at the marriage of your daughter , who is now queen .
and the rarest that came there .
bate , i beseech you , widow dido .
o , widow dido !
ay , widow dido .
is not , sir , my doublet as fresh as the first day i wore it ?
i mean , in a sort .
that sort was well fished for .
when i wore it at your daughter marriage ?
you cram these words into mine ears against the stomach of my sense .
would i had never married my daughter there !
for , coming thence , my son is lost and , in my rate , she too , who is so far from italy removed i again shall see her .
o thou mine heir of naples and of milan , what strange fish hath made his meal on thee ?
sir , he may live i saw him beat the surges under him , and ride upon their backs , he trod the water , whose enmity he flung aside , and breasted the surge most swoln that met him , his bold head the contentious waves he kept , and oar himself with his good arms in lusty stroke to the shore , that his basis bow , as stooping to relieve him i not doubt he came alive to land .
no , no , he gone .
sir , you may thank yourself for this great loss , that would not bless our europe with your daughter , but rather lose her to an african , where she at least is banish from your eye , who hath cause to wet the grief o .
prithee , peace .
you were kneel to and importuned otherwise by all of us , and the fair soul herself weigh between loathness and obedience , at which end o ' the beam should bow .
we have lost your son , i fear , for ever milan and naples have more widows in them of this business ' making than we bring men to comfort them the fault your own .
so is the o ' the loss .
my lord sebastian , the truth you speak doth lack some gentleness and time to speak it in you rub the sore , when you should bring the plaster .
very well .
and most chirurgeonly .
it is foul weather in us all , good sir , when you are cloudy .
foul weather ?
very foul .
had i plantation of this isle , my lord , with .
or docks , or mallows .
and were the king o , what would i do ?
being drunk for want of wine .
i ' the commonwealth i would by contraries execute all things , for no kind of traffic would i admit , no name of magistrate , letters should not be known , riches , poverty , and use of service , none , contract , succession , bourn , bound of land , tilth , vineyard , none , no use of metal , corn , or wine , or oil , no occupation , all men idle , all , and women too , but innocent and pure , no sovereignty , yet he would be king o .
the latter end of his commonwealth forgets the beginning .
all things in common nature should produce without sweat or endeavour treason , felony , sword , pike , knife , gun , or need of any engine , would i not have , but nature should bring forth , of its own kind , all foison , all abundance , to feed my innocent people .
no marrying his subjects ?
none , man , all idle whores and knaves .
i would with such perfection govern , sir , to excel the golden age .
god save his majesty !
long live gonzalo !
and , do you mark me , sir ?
prithee , no more thou dost talk nothing to me .
i do well believe your highness , and did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen , who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that they always use to laugh at nothing .
was you we laughed at .
who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing to you so you may continue and laugh at nothing still .
what a blow was there given !
an it had not fallen .
you are gentlemen of brave metal , you would lift the moon out of her sphere , if she would continue in it five weeks without changing .
enter ariel , invisible , playing solemn music we would so , and then go a .
nay , good my lord , be not angry .
no , i warrant you , i will not adventure my discretion so weakly .
will you laugh me asleep , for i am very heavy ?
go sleep , and hear us .
all sleep except alonso , sebastian , and antonio what , all so soon asleep !
i wish mine eyes would , with themselves , shut up my thoughts i find they are inclined to do so .
please you , sir , do not omit the heavy offer of it it seldom visits sorrow , when it doth , it is a comforter .
we two , my lord , will guard your person while you take your rest , and watch your safety .
thank you .
wondrous heavy .
alonso sleeps .
exit ariel what a strange drowsiness possesses them !
it is the quality o ' the climate .
why doth it not then our eyelids sink ?
i find not myself disposed to sleep .
nor i , my spirits are nimble .
they fell together all , as by consent , they dropp , as by a .
what might , worthy sebastian ?
o , what might ? no more and yet me thinks i see it in thy face , what thou shouldst be the occasion speaks thee , and my strong imagination sees a crown dropping upon thy head .
what , art thou waking ?
do you not hear me speak ?
i do , and surely it is a sleepy language and thou out of thy sleep .
what is it thou didst say ?
this is a strange repose , to be asleep with eyes wide open , standing , speaking , moving , and yet so fast asleep .
noble sebastian , thou thy fortune sleep die , rather , whiles thou art waking .
thou dost snore distinctly , there meaning in thy snores .
i am more serious than my custom you must be so too , if heed me , which to do trebles thee .
well , i am standing water .
i teach you how to flow .
do so to ebb hereditary sloth instructs me .
o , if you but knew how you the purpose cherish whiles thus you mock it !
how , in stripping it , you more invest it !
ebbing men , indeed , most often do so near the bottom run by their own fear or sloth .
prithee , say on the setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim a matter from thee , and a birth indeed which throes thee much to yield .
thus , sir although this lord of weak remembrance , this , who shall be of as little memory when he is earth , hath here almost persuade , for he a spirit of persuasion , only professes to persuade , the king his son alive , is as impossible that he undrown and he that sleeps here swims .
i have no hope that he undrown .
o , out of that hope ' what great hope have you !
no hope that way is another way so high a hope that even ambition can not pierce a wink beyond , but doubt discovery there .
will you grant with me that ferdinand is drown ?
he gone .
then , tell me , who the next heir of naples ?
claribel .
she that is queen of tunis , she that dwells ten leagues beyond man life , she that from naples can have no note , unless the sun were post the man i ' the moon too slow till chins be rough and razorable , she that from whom ?
we all were , though some cast again , and by that destiny to perform an act whereof what past is prologue , what to come in yours and my discharge .
what stuff is this !
how say you ?
is true , my brother daughter queen of tunis , so is she heir of naples , which regions there is some space .
a space whose every cubit seems to cry out , shall that claribel measure us back to naples ?
keep in tunis , and let sebastian wake . '
say , this were death that now hath seized them , why , they were no worse than now they are .
there be that can rule naples as well as he that sleeps , lords that can prate as amply and unnecessarily as this gonzalo , i myself could make a chough of as deep chat .
o , that you bore the mind that i do !
what a sleep were this for your advancement !
do you understand me ?
methinks i do .
and how does your content tender your own good fortune ?
i remember you did supplant your brother prospero .
true and look how well my garments sit upon me , much feater than before my brother servants were then my fellows , now they are my men .
but , for your conscience ?
ay , sir , where lies that ?
if a kibe , put me to my slipper but i feel not this deity in my bosom twenty consciences , that stand me and milan , candied be they and melt ere they molest !
here lies your brother , no better than the earth he lies upon , if he were that which now he like , that dead , whom i , with this obedient steel , three inches of it , can lay to bed for ever , whiles you , doing thus , to the perpetual wink for aye might put this ancient morsel , this sir prudence , who should not upbraid our course .
for all the rest , they take suggestion as a cat laps milk , they tell the clock to any business that we say befits the hour .
thy case , dear friend , shall be my precedent , as thou milan , i come by naples .
draw thy sword one stroke shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest , and i the king shall love thee .
draw together , and when i rear my hand , do you the like , to fall it on gonzalo .
o , but one word .
they talk apart ariel , invisible my master through his art foresees the danger that you , his friend , are in , and sends me forth for else his project dies to keep them living .
sings in gonzalo ear while you here do snoring lie , conspiracy his time doth take .
if of life you keep a care , shake off slumber , and beware awake , awake !
then let us both be sudden .
now , good angels preserve the king .
they wake why , how now ?
ho , awake !
why are you drawn ?
wherefore this ghastly looking ?
what the matter ?
whiles we stood here securing your repose , even now , we heard a hollow burst of bellowing like bulls , or rather lions not wake you ?
it struck mine ear most terribly .
i heard nothing .
o , was a din to fright a monster ear , to make an earthquake !
sure , it was the roar of a whole herd of lions .
heard you this , gonzalo ?
upon mine honour , sir , i heard a humming , and that a strange one too , which did awake me i shaked you , sir , and cried as mine eyes open , i saw their weapons drawn there was a noise , that verily .
is best we stand upon our guard , or that we quit this place , let draw our weapons .
lead off this ground , and let make further search for my poor son .
heavens keep him from these beasts !
for he is , sure , i ' the island .
lead away .
prospero my lord shall know what i have done so , king , go safely on to seek thy son .
exeunt scene ii .
another part of the island .
enter caliban with a burden of wood .
a noise of thunder heard all the infections that the sun sucks up from bogs , fens , flats , on prosper fall and make him by a disease !
his spirits hear me and yet i needs must curse .
but they nor pinch , fright me with urchin shows , pitch me i ' the mire , nor lead me , like a firebrand , in the dark out of my way , unless he bid , but for every trifle are they set upon me , sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me and after bite me , then like hedgehogs which lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount their pricks at my footfall , sometime am i all wound with adders who with cloven tongues do hiss me into madness .
enter trinculo lo , now , lo !
here comes a spirit of his , and to torment me for bringing wood in slowly .
i fall flat , perchance he will not mind me .
here neither bush nor shrub , to bear off any weather at all , and another storm brewing , i hear it sing i ' the wind yond same black cloud , yond huge one , looks like a foul bombard that would shed his liquor .
if it should thunder as it did before , i know not where to hide my head yond same cloud can not choose but fall by pailfuls .
what have we here ?
a man or a fish ?
dead or alive ?
a fish he smells like a fish , a very ancient and like smell , a kind of not of the newest john .
a strange fish !
were i in england now , as once i was , and had but this fish painted , not a holiday fool there but would give a piece of silver there would this monster make a man , any strange beast there makes a man when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame beggar , they will lazy out ten to see a dead indian .
legged like a man and his fins like arms !
warm o ' my troth !
i do now let loose my opinion , hold it no longer this is no fish , but an islander , that hath lately suffered by a thunderbolt .
thunder alas , the storm is come again !
my best way is to creep under his gaberdine , there is no other shelter hereabouts misery acquaints a man with strange .
i will here shroud till the dregs of the storm be past .
enter stephano , singing a bottle in his hand i shall no more to sea , to sea , here shall i die ashore this is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man funeral well , here my comfort .
drinks sings the master , the swabber , the boatswain and i , the gunner and his mate loved mall , meg and marian and margery , but none of us cared for kate , for she had a tongue with a tang , would cry to a sailor , go hang !
she loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch , yet a tailor might scratch her she did itch then to sea , boys , and let her go hang !
this is a scurvy tune too but here my comfort .
drinks do not torment me oh !
what the matter ?
have we devils here ?
do you put tricks upon with savages and men of ind , ha ?
i have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your four legs , for it hath been said , as proper a man as ever went on four legs can not make him give ground , and it shall be said so again while stephano breathes at nostrils .
the spirit torments me , oh !
this is some monster of the isle with four legs , who hath got , as i take it , an ague .
where the devil should he learn our language ?
i will give him some relief , if it be but for that .
if i can recover him and keep him tame and get to naples with him , he a present for any emperor that ever trod on neat leather .
do not torment me , prithee , i bring my wood home faster .
he in his fit now and does not talk after the wisest .
he shall taste of my bottle if he have never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his fit .
if i can recover him and keep him tame , i will not take too much for him , he shall pay for him that hath him , and that soundly .
thou dost me yet but little hurt , thou wilt anon , i know it by thy trembling now prosper works upon thee .
come on your ways , open your mouth , here is that which will give language to you , cat open your mouth , this will shake your shaking , i can tell you , and that soundly you can not tell who your friend open your chaps again .
i should know that voice it should be but he is drowned , and these are devils o defend me !
four legs and two voices a most delicate monster !
his forward voice now is to speak well of his friend , his backward voice is to utter foul speeches and to detract .
if all the wine in my bottle will recover him , i will help his ague .
come .
amen !
i will pour some in thy other mouth .
stephano !
doth thy other mouth call me ?
mercy , mercy !
this is a devil , and no monster i will leave him , i have no long spoon .
stephano !
if thou beest stephano , touch me and speak to me for i am trinculo be not afeard thy good friend trinculo .
if thou beest trinculo , come forth i pull thee by the lesser legs if any be trinculo legs , these are they .
thou art very trinculo indeed !
how camest thou to be the siege of this ?
can he vent trinculos ?
i took him to be killed with a .
but art thou not drowned , stephano ?
i hope now thou art not drowned .
is the storm overblown ?
i hid me under the dead gaberdine for fear of the storm .
and art thou living , stephano ?
o stephano , two neapolitans !
prithee , do not turn me about , my stomach is not constant .
aside these be fine things , an if they be not sprites .

i will kneel to him .
how didst thou ?
how camest thou hither ?
swear by this bottle how thou camest hither .
i escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors heaved , by this bottle , which i made of the bark of a tree with mine own hands since i was cast ashore .
i swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject , for the liquor is not earthly .
here , swear then how thou escapedst .
swum ashore .
man , like a duck i can swim like a duck , i be sworn .

though thou canst swim like a duck , thou art made like a goose .
o stephano .

how does thine ague ?
hast thou not dropp from heaven ?
out o ' the moon , i do assure thee i was the man i ' the moon when time was .
i have seen thee in her and i do adore thee my mistress show me thee and thy dog and thy bush .
come , swear to that , kiss the book i will furnish it anon with new contents swear .
by this good light , this is a very shallow monster !
i afeard of him !
a very weak monster !
the man i ' the moon !
a most poor credulous monster !
well drawn , monster , in good sooth !
i show thee every fertile inch o ' th ' island , and i will kiss thy foot i prithee , be my god .
by this light , a most perfidious and drunken monster !
when god asleep , he rob his bottle .

lead the way .
exeunt act iii scene i .
before prospero cell .
enter ferdinand , bearing a log there be some sports are painful , and their labour delight in them sets off some kinds of baseness are nobly undergone and most poor matters point to rich ends .
this my mean task would be as heavy to me as odious , but the mistress which i serve quickens what dead and makes my labours pleasures o , she is ten times more gentle than her father crabbed , and he composed of harshness .
i must remove some thousands of these logs and pile them up , upon a sore injunction my sweet mistress weeps when she sees me work , and says , such baseness had never like executor .
i forget but these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours , most busy lest , when i do it .
enter miranda , and prospero at a distance , unseen alas , now , pray you , work not so hard i would the lightning had burnt up those logs that you are enjoin to pile !
pray , set it down and rest you when this burns , weep for having wearied you .
my father is hard at study , pray now , rest yourself , he safe for these three hours .
o most dear mistress , the sun will set before i shall discharge what i must strive to do .
if you sit down , i bear your logs the while pray , give me that , i carry it to the pile .
no , precious creature , i had rather crack my sinews , break my back , than you should such dishonour undergo , while i sit lazy by .
it would become me as well as it does you and i should do it with much more ease , for my good will is to it , and yours it is against .
poor worm , thou art infected !
this visitation shows it .
you look wearily .
no , noble mistress , is fresh morning with me when you are by at night .
i do beseech you chiefly that i might set it in my prayers what is your name ?
o my father , i have broke your hest to say so !
admired miranda !
indeed the top of admiration !
worth what dearest to the world !
full many a lady i have eyed with best regard and many a time the harmony of their tongues hath into bondage brought my too diligent ear for several virtues have i liked several women , never any with so fun soul , but some defect in her did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed and put it to the foil but you , o you , so perfect and so peerless , are created of every creature best !
i do not know one of my sex , no woman face remember , save , from my glass , mine own , nor have i seen more that i may call men than you , good friend , and my dear father how features are abroad , i am skilless of , but , by my modesty , the jewel in my dower , i would not wish any companion in the world but you , nor can imagination form a shape , besides yourself , to like of .
but i prattle something too wildly and my father precepts i therein do forget .
i am in my condition a prince , miranda , i do think , a king , i would , not so ! and would no more endure this wooden slavery than to suffer the blow my mouth .
hear my soul speak the very instant that i saw you , did my heart fly to your service , there resides , to make me slave to it , and for your sake am i this patient log man .
do you love me ?
o heaven , o earth , bear witness to this sound and crown what i profess with kind event if i speak true !
if hollowly , invert what best is boded me to mischief !
i beyond all limit of what else i ' the world do love , prize , honour you .
i am a fool to weep at what i am glad of .
fair encounter of two most rare affections !
heavens rain grace on that which breeds between !
wherefore weep you ?
at mine unworthiness that dare not offer what i desire to give , and much less take what i shall die to want .
but this is trifling , and all the more it seeks to hide itself , the bigger bulk it shows .
hence , bashful cunning !
and prompt me , plain and holy innocence !
i am your wife , if you will marry me , if not , i die your maid to be your fellow you may deny me , but i be your servant , whether you will or no .
my mistress , dearest , and i thus humble ever .
my husband , then ?
ay , with a heart as willing as bondage of freedom here my hand .
and mine , with my heart i , and now farewell till half an hour hence .
a thousand thousand !
exeunt ferdinand and miranda severally so glad of this as they i can not be , who are surprised withal , but my rejoicing at nothing can be more .
i to my book , for yet ere must i perform much business appertaining .
exit scene ii .
another part of the island .
enter caliban , stephano , and trinculo tell not me , when the butt is out , we will drink water , not a drop before therefore bear up , and board .
, drink to me .
!
the folly of this island !
they say there but five upon this isle we are three of them , if th ' other two be brained like us , the state totters .
drink , , when i bid thee thy eyes are almost set in thy head .
where should they be set else ?
he were a brave monster indeed , if they were set in his tail .
my hath drown his tongue in sack for my part , the sea can not drown me , i swam , ere i could recover the shore , five and thirty leagues off and on .
by this light , thou shalt be my lieutenant , monster , or my standard .
your lieutenant , if you list , he no standard .
we not run , monsieur monster .
nor go neither , but you lie like dogs and yet say nothing neither .
, speak once in thy life , if thou beest a good .
how does thy honour ?
let me lick thy shoe .
i not serve him , he not valiant .
thou liest , most ignorant monster i am in case to justle a constable .
why , thou deboshed fish thou , was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much sack as i ?
wilt thou tell a monstrous lie , being but half a fish and half a monster ?
lo , how he mocks me !
wilt thou let him , my lord ?
' quoth he !
that a monster should be such a natural !
lo , lo , again !
bite him to death , i prithee .
trinculo , keep a good tongue in your head if you prove a mutineer , the next tree !
the poor monster my subject and he shall not suffer indignity .
i thank my noble lord .
wilt thou be pleased to hearken once again to the suit i made to thee ?
marry , will i kneel and repeat it , i will stand , and so shall trinculo .
enter ariel , invisible as i told thee before , i am subject to a tyrant , a sorcerer , that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island .
thou liest .
thou liest , thou jesting monkey , thou i would my valiant master would destroy thee !
i do not lie .
trinculo , if you trouble him any more in tale , by this hand , i will supplant some of your teeth .
why , i said nothing .
mum , then , and no more .
proceed .
i say , by sorcery he got this isle , from me he got it .
if thy greatness will revenge it on him , for i know thou darest , but this thing dare not , that most certain .
thou shalt be lord of it and i serve thee .
how now shall this be compassed ?
canst thou bring me to the party ?
yea , yea , my lord i yield him thee asleep , where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead .
thou liest , thou canst not .
what a pied ninny this !
thou scurvy patch !
i do beseech thy greatness , give him blows and take his bottle from him when that gone he shall drink nought but brine , for i not show him where the quick freshes are .
trinculo , run into no further danger interrupt the monster one word further , and , by this hand , i turn my mercy out o ' doors and make a of thee .
why , what did i ?
i did nothing .
i go farther off .
didst thou not say he lied ?
thou liest .
do i so ?
take thou that .
beats trinculo as you like this , give me the lie another time .
i did not give the lie .
out o ' your wits and bearing too ?
a pox o ' your bottle !
this can sack and drinking do .
a murrain on your monster , and the devil take your fingers !
ha , ha , ha !
now , forward with your tale .
prithee , stand farther off .
beat him enough after a little time i beat him too .
stand farther .
come , proceed .
why , as i told thee , is a custom with him , i ' th ' afternoon to sleep there thou mayst brain him , having first seized his books , or with a log batter his skull , or paunch him with a stake , or cut his wezand with thy knife .
remember first to possess his books , for without them he but a sot , as i am , nor hath not one spirit to command they all do hate him as rootedly as i .
burn but his books .
he has brave utensils , for so he calls them which when he has a house , he deck withal and that most deeply to consider is the beauty of his daughter , he himself calls her a nonpareil i never saw a woman , but only sycorax my dam and she , but she as far surpasseth sycorax as does least .
is it so brave a lass ?
ay , lord , she will become thy bed , i warrant .
and bring thee forth brave brood .
monster , i will kill this man his daughter and i will be king and queen save our graces ! and trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys .
dost thou like the plot , trinculo ?
excellent .
give me thy hand i am sorry i beat thee , but , while thou livest , keep a good tongue in thy head .
within this half hour will he be asleep wilt thou destroy him then ?
ay , on mine honour .
this will i tell my master .
thou makest me merry , i am full of pleasure let us be jocund will you troll the catch you taught me but ?
at thy request , monster , i will do reason , any reason .
come on , trinculo , let us sing .
sings flout and scout and scout and flout thought is free .
that not the tune .
ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe what is this same ?
this is the tune of our catch , played by the picture of nobody .
if thou beest a man , show thyself in thy likeness if thou beest a devil , as thou list .
o , forgive me my sins !
he that dies pays all debts i defy thee .
mercy upon us !
art thou afeard ?
no , monster , not i .
be not afeard , the isle is full of noises , sounds and sweet airs , that give delight and hurt not .
sometimes a thousand twangling instruments will hum about mine ears , and sometime voices that , if i then had waked after long sleep , will make me sleep again and then , in dreaming , the clouds methought would open and show riches ready to drop upon me that , when i waked , i cried to dream again .
this will prove a brave kingdom to me , where i shall have my music for nothing .
when prospero is destroyed .
that shall be by and by i remember the story .
the sound is going away , let follow it , and after do our work .
lead , monster , we follow .
i would i could see this tabourer , he lays it on .
wilt come ?
i follow , stephano .
exeunt scene iii .
another part of the island .
enter alonso , sebastian , antonio , gonzalo , adrian , francisco , and others by ' r lakin , i can go no further , sir , my old bones ache here a maze trod indeed through and meanders !
by your patience , i needs must rest me .
old lord , i can not blame thee , who am myself attach with weariness , to the dulling of my spirits sit down , and rest .
even here i will put off my hope and keep it no longer for my flatterer he is drown whom thus we stray to find , and the sea mocks our frustrate search on land .
well , let him go .
aside to sebastian i am right glad that he so out of hope .
do not , for one repulse , forego the purpose that you resolved to effect .
aside to antonio the next advantage will we take throughly .
aside to sebastian let it be , for , now they are oppress with travel , they will not , nor can not , use such vigilance as when they are fresh .
aside to antonio i say , no more .
solemn and strange music what harmony is this ?
my good friends , hark !
marvellous sweet music !
enter prospero above , invisible .
enter several strange shapes , bringing in a banquet , they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation , and , inviting the king , and to eat , they depart give us kind keepers , heavens !
what were these ?
a living drollery .
now i will believe that there are unicorns , that in arabia there is one tree , the phoenix ' throne , one phoenix at this hour reigning there .
i believe both , and what does else want credit , come to me , and i be sworn is true travellers did lie , though fools at home condemn .
if in naples i should report this now , would they believe me ?
if i should say , i saw such islanders for , certes , these are people of the island who , though they are of monstrous shape , yet , note , their manners are more than of our human generation you shall find many , nay , almost any .
aside honest lord , thou hast said well , for some of you there present are worse than devils .
i can not too much muse such shapes , such gesture and such sound , expressing , although they want the use of tongue , a kind of excellent dumb discourse .
aside praise in departing .
they vanish strangely .
no matter , since they have left their viands behind , for we have stomachs .
please you taste of what is here ?
not i .
faith , sir , you need not fear .
when we were boys , who would believe that there were mountaineers like bulls , whose throats had hanging at wallets of flesh ?
or that there were such men whose heads stood in their breasts ?
which now we find each of five for one will bring us good warrant of .
i will stand to and feed , although my last no matter , since i feel the best is past .
brother , my lord the duke , stand to and do as we .
thunder and lightning .
enter ariel , like a harpy , claps his wings upon the table , and , with a quaint device , the banquet vanishes you are three men of sin , whom destiny , that hath to instrument this lower world and what is i , the sea hath caused to belch up you , and on this island where man doth not inhabit , you men being most unfit to live .
i have made you mad , and even with valour men hang and drown their proper selves .
alonso , sebastian and draw their swords you fools !
i and my fellows are ministers of fate the elements , of whom your swords are temper , may as well wound the loud winds , or with stabs kill the waters , as diminish one dowle that in my plume my are like invulnerable .
if you could hurt , your swords are now too massy for your strengths and will not be uplifted .
but remember for that my business to you that you three from milan did supplant good prospero , exposed unto the sea , which hath requit it , him and his innocent child for which foul deed the powers , delaying , not forgetting , have incensed the seas and shores , yea , all the creatures , against your peace .
thee of thy son , alonso , they have bereft , and do pronounce by me lingering perdition , worse than any death can be at once , shall step by step attend you and your ways , whose wraths to guard you from which here , in this most desolate isle , else falls upon your heads is nothing but and a clear life ensuing .
he vanishes in thunder , then , to soft music enter the shapes again , and dance , with mocks and mows , and carrying out the table bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou perform , my ariel , a grace it had , devouring of my instruction hast thou nothing bated in what thou hadst to say so , with good life and observation strange , my meaner ministers their several kinds have done .
my high charms work and these mine enemies are all knit up in their distractions , they now are in my power , and in these fits i leave them , while i visit young ferdinand , whom they suppose is drown , and his and mine loved darling .
exit above i ' the name of something holy , sir , why stand you in this strange stare ?
o , it is monstrous , monstrous methought the billows spoke and told me of it , the winds did sing it to me , and the thunder , that deep and dreadful , pronounced the name of prosper it did bass my trespass .
therefore my son i ' the ooze is bedded , and i seek him deeper than plummet sounded and with him there lie mudded .
exit but one fiend at a time , i fight their legions .
i be thy second .
exeunt sebastian , and antonio all three of them are desperate their great guilt , like poison given to work a great time after , now to bite the spirits .
i do beseech you that are of suppler joints , follow them swiftly and hinder them from what this ecstasy may now provoke them to .
follow , i pray you .
exeunt act iv scene i .
before prospero cell .
enter prospero , ferdinand , and miranda if i have too austerely punish you , your compensation makes amends , for i have given you here a third of mine own life , or that for which i live , who once again i tender to thy hand all thy vexations were but my trials of thy love and thou hast strangely stood the test here , afore heaven , i ratify this my rich gift .
o ferdinand , do not smile at me that i boast her off , for thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise and make it halt behind her .
i do believe it against an oracle .
then , as my gift and thine own acquisition worthily purchased take my daughter but if thou dost break her before all sanctimonious ceremonies may with full and holy rite be minister , no sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall to make this contract grow but barren hate , disdain and discord shall bestrew the union of your bed with weeds so loathly that you shall hate it both therefore take heed , as hymen lamps shall light you .
as i hope for quiet days , fair issue and long life , with such love as is now , the murkiest den , the most opportune place , the suggestion .
our worser genius can , shall never melt mine honour into lust , to take away the edge of that day celebration when i shall think or phoebus ' steeds are founder , or night kept chain below .
fairly spoke .
sit then and talk with her , she is thine own .
what , ariel !
my industrious servant , ariel !
enter ariel what would my potent master ?
here i am .
thou and thy meaner fellows your last service did worthily perform , and i must use you in such another trick .
go bring the rabble , whom i give thee power , here to this place incite them to quick motion , for i must bestow upon the eyes of this young couple some vanity of mine art it is my promise , and they expect it from me .
presently ?
ay , with a twink .
before you can say ' and , ' and breathe twice and cry , so , ' each one , tripping on his toe , will be here with mop and mow .
do you love me , master ?
no ?
dearly my delicate ariel .
do not approach till thou dost hear me call .
well , i conceive .
exit look thou be true , do not give dalliance too much the rein the strongest oaths are straw to the fire i ' the blood be more abstemious , or else , good night your vow !
i warrant you sir , the white cold virgin snow upon my heart abates the ardour of my liver .
well .
now come , my ariel !

soft music enter iris ceres , most bounteous lady , thy rich leas of wheat , rye , barley , vetches , oats and pease , thy turfy mountains , where live nibbling sheep , and flat meads thatch with stover , them to keep , thy banks with pioned and twilled brims , which spongy april at thy hest betrims , to make cold nymphs chaste crowns , and thy broom , whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves , being thy vineyard , and thy , sterile and , where thou thyself dost air , the queen o ' the sky , whose watery arch and messenger am i , bids thee leave these , and with her sovereign grace , here on this , in this very place , to come and sport her peacocks fly amain approach , rich ceres , her to entertain .
enter ceres hail , messenger , that dost disobey the wife of jupiter , who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers diffusest , refreshing showers , and with each end of thy blue bow dost crown my bosky acres and my unshrubb down , rich scarf to my proud earth , why hath thy queen summon me hither , to this green ?
a contract of true love to celebrate , and some donation freely to estate on the blest lovers .
tell me , heavenly bow , if venus or her son , as thou dost know , do now attend the queen ?
since they did plot the means that dusky dis my daughter got , her and her blind boy scandal company i have forsworn .
of her society be not afraid i met her deity cutting the clouds towards paphos and her son with her .
here thought they to have done some wanton charm upon this man and maid , whose vows are , that no shall be paid till hymen torch be lighted but vain , mars hot minion is returned again , her son has broke his arrows , swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows and be a boy right out .
queen of state , great juno , comes , i know her by her gait .
enter juno how does my bounteous sister ?
go with me to bless this twain , that they may prosperous be and honour in their issue .
they sing honour , riches , , long continuance , and increasing , hourly joys be still upon you !
juno sings her blessings upon you .
earth increase , foison plenty , barns and garners never empty , vines and clustering bunches growing , plants with goodly burthen bowing , spring come to you at the farthest in the very end of harvest !
scarcity and want shall shun you , ceres ' blessing so is on you .
this is a most majestic vision , and harmoniously charmingly .
may i be bold to think these spirits ?
spirits , which by mine art i have from their confines call to enact my present fancies .
let me live here ever , so rare a wonder father and a wife makes this place paradise .
juno and ceres whisper , and send iris on employment sweet , now , silence !
juno and ceres whisper seriously , there something else to do hush , and be mute , or else our spell is marr .
you nymphs , call naiads , of the windring brooks , with your sedged crowns and looks , leave your crisp channels and on this green land answer your summons , juno does command come , temperate nymphs , and help to celebrate a contract of true love , be not too late .
enter certain nymphs you sunburnt sicklemen , of august weary , come hither from the furrow and be merry make holiday , your hats put on and these fresh nymphs encounter every one in country footing .
enter certain reapers , properly habited they join with the nymphs in a graceful dance , towards the end whereof prospero starts suddenly , and speaks , after which , to a strange , hollow , and confused noise , they heavily vanish aside i had forgot that foul conspiracy of the beast caliban and his confederates against my life the minute of their plot is almost come .
to the spirits well done !
avoid , no more !
this is strange your father in some passion that works him strongly .
never till this day saw i him touch with anger so distemper .
you do look , my son , in a moved sort , as if you were dismay be cheerful , sir .
our revels now are ended .
these our actors , as i foretold you , were all spirits and are melted into air , into thin air and , like the baseless fabric of this vision , the towers , the gorgeous palaces , the solemn temples , the great globe itself , ye all which it inherit , shall dissolve and , like this insubstantial pageant faded , leave not a rack behind .
we are such stuff as dreams are made on , and our little life is rounded with a sleep .
sir , i am vex , bear with my weakness , my , brain is troubled be not disturb with my infirmity if you be pleased , retire into my cell and there repose a turn or two i walk , to still my beating mind .
we wish your peace .
exeunt come with a thought i thank thee , ariel come .
enter ariel thy thoughts i cleave to .
what thy pleasure ?
spirit , we must prepare to meet with caliban .
ay , my commander when i presented ceres , i thought to have told thee of it , but i fear lest i might anger thee .
say again , where didst thou leave these varlets ?
i told you , sir , they were with drinking , so fun of valour that they smote the air for breathing in their faces , beat the ground for kissing of their feet , yet always bending towards their project .
then i beat my tabour , at which , like unback colts , they prick their ears , advanced their eyelids , lifted up their noses as they smelt music so i charm their ears that they my lowing follow through tooth briers , sharp furzes , pricking goss and thorns , which entered their frail shins at last i left them i ' the pool beyond your cell , there dancing up to the chins , that the foul lake their feet .
this was well done , my bird .
thy shape invisible retain thou still the trumpery in my house , go bring it hither , for stale to catch these thieves .
i go , i go .
exit a devil , a born devil , on whose nature nurture can never stick , on whom my pains , humanely taken , all , all lost , quite lost , and as with age his body uglier grows , so his mind cankers .
i will plague them all , even to roaring .
ariel , loaden with glistering apparel , and c come , hang them on this line .
prospero and ariel remain invisible .
enter caliban , stephano , and trinculo , all wet pray you , tread softly , that the blind mole may not hear a foot fall we now are near his cell .
monster , your fairy , which you say is a harmless fairy , has done little better than played the jack with us .
monster , i do smell all , at which my nose is in great indignation .
so is mine .
do you hear , monster ?
if i should take a displeasure against you , look you , thou wert but a lost monster .
good my lord , give me thy favour still .
be patient , for the prize i bring thee to shall hoodwink this mischance therefore speak softly .
all hush as midnight yet .
ay , but to lose our bottles in the pool , there is not only disgrace and dishonour in that , monster , but an infinite loss .
that more to me than my wetting yet this is your harmless fairy , monster .
i will fetch off my bottle , though i be ears for my labour .
prithee , my king , be quiet .
seest thou here , this is the mouth o ' the cell no noise , and enter .
do that good mischief which may make this island thine own for ever , and i , thy caliban , for aye thy .
give me thy hand .
i do begin to have bloody thoughts .
o king stephano !
o peer !
o worthy stephano !
look what a wardrobe here is for thee !
let it alone , thou fool , it is but trash .
o , ho , monster !
we know what belongs to a frippery .
o king stephano !
put off that gown , trinculo , by this hand , i have that gown .
thy grace shall have it .
the dropsy drown this fool i what do you mean to dote thus on such luggage ?
let alone and do the murder first if he awake , from toe to crown he fill our skins with pinches , make us strange stuff .
be you quiet , monster .
mistress line , is not this my jerkin ?
now is the jerkin under the line now , jerkin , you are like to lose your hair and prove a bald jerkin .
do , do we steal by line and level , a like your grace .
i thank thee for that jest , here a garment wit shall not go unrewarded while i am king of this country .
by line and level ' is an excellent pass of pate , there another garment .
monster , come , put some lime upon your fingers , and away with the rest .
i will have none o we shall lose our time , and all be turn to barnacles , or to apes with foreheads villanous low .
monster , your fingers help to bear this away where my hogshead of wine is , or i turn you out of my kingdom go to , carry this .
and this .
ay , and this .
a noise of hunters heard .
enter divers spirits , in shape of dogs and hounds , and hunt them about , prospero and ariel setting them on hey , mountain , hey !
silver i there it goes , silver !
fury , fury !
there , tyrant , there !
hark !
hark !
caliban , stephano , and trinculo , are driven out go charge my goblins that they grind their joints with dry convulsions , shorten up their sinews with aged cramps , and more make them than pard or cat o ' mountain .
hark , they roar !
let them be hunted soundly .
at this hour lie at my mercy all mine enemies shortly shall all my labours end , and thou shalt have the air at freedom for a little follow , and do me service .
exeunt act v scene i .
before prospero cell .
enter prospero in his magic robes , and ariel now does my project gather to a head my charms crack not , my spirits obey , and time goes upright with his carriage .
how the day ?
on the sixth hour , at which time , my lord , you said our work should cease .
i did say so , when first i raised the tempest .
say , my spirit , how fares the king and followers ?
confined together in the same fashion as you gave in charge , just as you left them , all prisoners , sir , in the which your cell , they can not budge till your release .
the king , his brother and yours , abide all three distracted and the remainder mourning over them , brimful of sorrow and dismay , but chiefly him that you term , sir , good old lord gonzalo , ' his tears run down his beard , like winter drops from eaves of reeds .
your charm so strongly works that if you now beheld them , your affections would become tender .
dost thou think so , spirit ?
mine would , sir , were i human .
and mine shall .
hast thou , which art but air , a touch , a feeling of their afflictions , and shall not myself , one of their kind , that relish all as sharply , passion as they , be kindlier moved than thou art ?
though with their high wrongs i am struck to the quick , yet with my nobler reason my fury do i take part the rarer action is in virtue than in vengeance they being penitent , the sole drift of my purpose doth extend not a frown further .
go release them , ariel my charms i break , their senses i restore , and they shall be themselves .
i fetch them , sir .
exit ye elves of hills , brooks , standing lakes and groves , and ye that on the sands with printless foot do chase the ebbing neptune and do fly him when he comes back , you that by moonshine do the green sour ringlets make , whereof the ewe not bites , and you whose pastime is to make midnight mushrooms , that rejoice to hear the solemn curfew , by whose aid , weak masters though ye be , i have bedimm the noontide sun , call forth the mutinous winds , and the green sea and the azured vault set roaring war to the dread rattling thunder have i given fire and rifted jove stout oak with his own bolt , the promontory have i made shake and by the spurs pluck up the pine and cedar graves at my command have waked their sleepers , oped , and let forth by my so potent art .
but this rough magic i here abjure , and , when i have required some heavenly music , which even now i do , to work mine end upon their senses that this airy charm is for , i break my staff , bury it certain fathoms in the earth , and deeper than did ever plummet sound i drown my book .
solemn music ariel before then alonso , with a frantic gesture , attended by gonzalo , sebastian and antonio in like manner , attended by adrian and francisco they all enter the circle which prospero had made , and there stand charmed , which prospero observing , speaks a solemn air and the best comforter to an unsettled fancy cure thy brains , now useless , boil within thy skull !
there stand , for you are .
holy gonzalo , honourable man , mine eyes , even sociable to the show of thine , fall fellowly drops .
the charm dissolves apace , and as the morning steals upon the night , melting the darkness , so their rising senses begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle their clearer reason .
o good gonzalo , my true preserver , and a loyal sir to him you !
i will pay thy graces home both in word and deed .
most cruelly didst thou , alonso , use me and my daughter thy brother was a furtherer in the act .
thou art pinch fort now , sebastian .
flesh and blood , you , brother mine , that entertain ambition , expell remorse and nature , who , with sebastian , whose inward pinches therefore are most strong , would here have kill your king , i do forgive thee , unnatural though thou art .
their understanding begins to swell , and the approaching tide will shortly fill the reasonable shore that now lies foul and muddy .
not one of them that yet looks on me , or would know me ariel , fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell i will discase me , and myself present as i was sometime milan quickly , spirit , thou shalt ere long be free .
ariel sings and helps to attire him where the bee sucks .
there suck i in a cowslip bell i lie , there i couch when owls do cry .
on the bat back i do fly after summer merrily .
merrily , merrily shall i live now under the blossom that hangs on the bough .
why , that my dainty ariel !
i shall miss thee but yet thou shalt have freedom so , so , so .
to the king ship , invisible as thou art there shalt thou find the mariners asleep under the hatches , the master and the boatswain being awake , enforce them to this place , and presently , i prithee .
i drink the air before me , and return or ere your pulse twice beat .
exit all torment , trouble , wonder and amazement inhabits here some heavenly power guide us out of this fearful country !
behold , sir king , the wronged duke of milan , prospero for more assurance that a living prince does now speak to thee , i embrace thy body , and to thee and thy company i bid a hearty welcome .
whether thou best he or no , or some enchanted trifle to abuse me , as late i have been , i not know thy pulse beats as of flesh and blood , and , since i saw thee , the affliction of my mind amends , with which , i fear , a madness held me this must crave , an if this be at all , a most strange story .
thy dukedom i resign and do entreat thou pardon me my wrongs .
but how should prospero be living and be here ?
first , noble friend , let me embrace thine age , whose honour can not be measured or confined .
whether this be or be not , i not swear .
you do yet taste some subtilties o ' the isle , that will not let you believe things certain .
welcome , my friends all !
aside to sebastian and antonio but you , my brace of lords , were i so minded , i here could pluck his highness ' frown upon you and justify you traitors at this time i will tell no tales .
aside the devil speaks in him .
no .
for you , most wicked sir , whom to call brother would even infect my mouth , i do forgive thy rankest fault , all of them , and require my dukedom of thee , which perforce , i know , thou must restore .
if thou prospero , give us particulars of thy preservation , how thou hast met us here , who three hours since were wreck upon this shore , where i have lost how sharp the point of this remembrance is ! my dear son ferdinand .
i am woe , sir .
irreparable is the loss , and patience says it is past her cure .
i rather think you have not sought her help , of whose soft grace for the like loss i have her sovereign aid and rest myself content .
you the like loss !
as great to me as late , and , supportable to make the dear loss , have i means much weaker than you may call to comfort you , for i have lost my daughter .
a daughter ?
o heavens , that they were living both in naples , the king and queen there !
that they were , i wish myself were mudded in that oozy bed where my son lies .
when did you lose your daughter ?
in this last tempest .
i perceive these lords at this encounter do so much admire that they devour their reason and scarce think their eyes do offices of truth , their words are natural breath but , you have been justled from your senses , know for certain that i am prospero and that very duke which was thrust forth of milan , who most strangely upon this shore , where you were wreck , was landed , to be the lord o .
no more yet of this , for is a chronicle of day by day , not a relation for a breakfast nor befitting this first meeting .
welcome , sir , this cell my court here have i few attendants and subjects none abroad pray you , look in .
my dukedom since you have given me again , i will requite you with as good a thing , at least bring forth a wonder , to content ye as much as me my dukedom .
here prospero discovers ferdinand and miranda playing at chess sweet lord , you play me false .
no , my love , i would not for the world .
yes , for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle , and i would call it , fair play .
if this prove a vision of the island , one dear son shall i twice lose .
a most high miracle !
though the seas threaten , they are merciful , i have cursed them without cause .
kneels now all the blessings of a glad father compass thee about !
arise , and say how thou camest here .
o , wonder !
how many goodly creatures are there here !
how beauteous mankind is !
o brave new world , that has such people i !
is new to thee .
what is this maid with whom thou wast at play ?
your acquaintance can not be three hours is she the goddess that hath sever us , and brought us thus together ?
sir , she is mortal , but by immortal providence she mine i chose her when i could not ask my father for his advice , nor thought i had one .
she is daughter to this famous duke of milan , of whom so often i have heard renown , but never saw before , of whom i have received a second life , and second father this lady makes him to me .
i am hers but , o , how oddly will it sound that i must ask my child forgiveness !
there , sir , stop let us not burthen our remembrance with a heaviness that gone .
i have inly wept , or should have spoke ere this .
look down , you god , and on this couple drop a blessed crown !
for it is you that have chalk forth the way which brought us hither .
i say , amen , gonzalo !
was milan thrust from milan , that his issue should become kings of naples ?
o , rejoice beyond a common joy , and set it down with gold on lasting pillars in one voyage did claribel her husband find at tunis , and ferdinand , her brother , found a wife where he himself was lost , prospero his dukedom in a poor isle and all of us ourselves when no man was his own .
to ferdinand and miranda give me your hands let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy !
be it so !
amen !
ariel , with the master and boatswain amazedly following o , look , sir , look , sir !
here is more of us i prophesied , if a gallows were on land , this fellow could not drown .
now , blasphemy , that grace , not an oath on shore ?
hast thou no mouth by land ?
what is the news ?
the best news is , that we have safely found our king and company , the next , our ship which , but three glasses since , we gave out split is tight and yare and bravely rigg as when we first put out to sea .
aside to prospero sir , all this service have i done since i went .
aside to ariel my tricksy spirit !
these are not natural events , they strengthen from strange to stranger .
say , how came you hither ?
if i did think , sir , i were well awake , strive to tell you .
we were dead of sleep , and how we know not all clapp under hatches , where but even now with strange and several noises of roaring , shrieking , howling , jingling chains , and more diversity of sounds , all horrible , we were awaked , straightway , at liberty , where we , in all her trim , freshly beheld our royal , good and gallant ship , our master capering to eye her on a trice , so please you , even in a dream , were we divided from them and were brought moping hither .
aside to prospero well done ?
aside to ariel bravely , my diligence .
thou shalt be free .
this is as strange a maze as men trod and there is in this business more than nature was ever conduct of some oracle must rectify our knowledge .
sir , my liege , do not infest your mind with beating on the strangeness of this business , at pick leisure which shall be shortly , single i resolve you , which to you shall seem probable , of every these happen accidents , till when , be cheerful and think of each thing well .
aside to ariel come hither , spirit set caliban and his companions free , untie the spell .
exit ariel how fares my gracious sir ?
there are yet missing of your company some few odd lads that you remember not .
ariel , driving in caliban , stephano and trinculo , in their stolen apparel every man shift for all the rest , and let no man take care for himself , for all is but fortune .
coragio , , coragio !
if these be true spies which i wear in my head , here a goodly sight .
o setebos , these be brave spirits indeed !
how fine my master is !
i am afraid he will chastise me .
ha , ha !
what things are these , my lord antonio ?
will money buy ?
very like , one of them is a plain fish , and , no doubt , marketable .
mark but the badges of these men , my lords , then say if they be true .
this knave , his mother was a witch , and one so strong that could control the moon , make flows and ebbs , and deal in her command without her power .
these three have robb me , and this for he a bastard one had plotted with them to take my life .
two of these fellows you must know and own , this thing of darkness !
acknowledge mine .
i shall be pinch to death .
is not this stephano , my drunken butler ?
he is drunk now where had he wine ?
and trinculo is reeling ripe where should they find this grand liquor that hath gilded ?
how camest thou in this pickle ?
i have been in such a pickle since i saw you last that , i fear me , will never out of my bones i shall not fear .
why , how now , stephano !
o , touch me not , i am not stephano , but a cramp .
be king o ' the isle , sirrah ?
i should have been a sore one then .
this is a strange thing as i look on .
pointing to caliban he is as disproportion in his manners as in his shape .
go , sirrah , to my cell , take with you your companions , as you look to have my pardon , trim it handsomely .
ay , that i will , and i be wise hereafter and seek for grace .
what a ass was i , to take this drunkard for a god and worship this dull fool !
go to , away !
hence , and bestow your luggage where you found it .
or stole it , rather .
exeunt caliban , stephano , and trinculo sir , i invite your highness and your train to my poor cell , where you shall take your rest for this one night , which , part of it , i waste with such discourse as , i not doubt , shall make it go quick away , the story of my life and the particular accidents gone by since i came to this isle and in the morn i bring you to your ship and so to naples , where i have hope to see the nuptial of these our solemnized , and thence retire me to my milan , where every third thought shall be my grave .
i long to hear the story of your life , which must take the ear strangely .
i deliver all , and promise you calm seas , auspicious gales and sail so expeditious that shall catch your royal fleet far off .
aside to ariel my ariel , chick , that is thy charge then to the elements be free , and fare thou well !
please you , draw near .
exeunt epilogue spoken by prospero now my charms are all , and what strength i have mine own , which is most faint now , is true , i must be here confined by you , or sent to naples .
let me not , since i have my dukedom got and pardon the deceiver , dwell in this bare island by your spell , but release me from my bands with the help of your good hands gentle breath of yours my sails must fill , or else my project fails , which was to please .
now i want spirits to enforce , art to enchant , and my ending is despair , unless i be relieved by prayer , which pierces so that it assaults mercy itself and frees all faults .
as you from crimes would pardon be , let your indulgence set me free .

a most incomparable man , breathed , as it were , to an untirable and continuate goodness he passes .
jeweller i have a jewel here o , pray , let for the lord timon , sir ?
jeweller if he will touch the estimate but , for that reciting to himself we for recompense have praised the vile , it stains the glory in that happy verse which aptly sings the good . '
is a good form .
looking at the jewel and rich here is a water , look ye .
you are rapt , sir , in some work , some dedication to the great lord .
a thing slipp idly from me .
our poesy is as a gum , which oozes from whence is nourish the fire i ' the flint shows not till it be struck , our gentle flame provokes itself and like the current flies each bound it chafes .
what have you there ?
a picture , sir .
when comes your book forth ?
upon the heels of my presentment , sir .
let see your piece .
is a good piece .
so is this comes off well and excellent .
indifferent .
admirable how this grace speaks his own standing !
what a mental power this eye shoots forth !
how big imagination moves in this lip !
to the dumbness of the gesture one might interpret .
it is a pretty mocking of the life .
here is a touch , good ?
i will say of it , it tutors nature artificial strife lives in these touches , livelier than life .
enter certain senators , and pass over how this lord is follow !
the senators of athens happy man !
look , more !
you see this confluence , this great flood of visitors .
i have , in this rough work , shaped out a man , whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug with amplest entertainment my free drift halts not particularly , but moves itself in a wide sea of wax no levell malice infects one comma in the course i hold , but flies an eagle flight , bold and forth on , leaving no tract behind .
how shall i understand you ?
i will unbolt to you .
you see how all conditions , how all minds , as well of glib and slippery creatures as of grave and austere quality , tender down their services to lord timon his large fortune upon his good and gracious nature hanging subdues and properties to his love and tendance all sorts of hearts , yea , from the flatterer to apemantus , that few things loves better than to abhor himself even he drops down the knee before him , and returns in peace most rich in timon nod .
i saw them speak together .
sir , i have upon a high and pleasant hill feign fortune to be throned the base o ' the mount is rank with all deserts , all kind of natures , that labour on the bosom of this sphere to propagate their states amongst them all , whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix , one do i personate of lord timon frame , whom fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her , whose present grace to present slaves and servants translates his rivals .
is conceived to scope .
this throne , this fortune , and this hill , methinks , with one man beckon from the rest below , bowing his head against the sleepy mount to climb his happiness , would be well express in our condition .
nay , sir , but hear me on .
all those which were his fellows but of late , some better than his value , on the moment follow his strides , his lobbies fill with tendance , rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear , make sacred even his stirrup , and through him drink the free air .
ay , marry , what of these ?
when fortune in her shift and change of mood spurns down her late beloved , all his dependants which labour after him to the mountain top even on their knees and hands , let him slip down , not one accompanying his declining foot .
is common a thousand moral paintings i can show that shall demonstrate these quick blows of fortune more pregnantly than words .
yet you do well to show lord timon that mean eyes have seen the foot above the head .
trumpets sound .
enter timon , addressing himself courteously to every suitor , a messenger from ventidius talking with him , lucilius and other servants following imprison is he , say you ?
ay , my good lord five talents is his debt , his means most short , his creditors most strait your honourable letter he desires to those have shut him up , which failing , periods his comfort .
noble ventidius !
well , i am not of that feather to shake off my friend when he must need me .
i do know him a gentleman that well deserves a help which he shall have i pay the debt , and free him .
your lordship ever binds him .
commend me to him i will send his ransom , and being enfranchised , bid him come to me .
is not enough to help the feeble up , but to support him after .
fare you well .
all happiness to your honour !

if in her marriage my consent be missing , i call the gods to witness , i will choose mine heir from forth the beggars of the world , and dispossess her all .

heavens , that i were a lord !
what wouldst do then , apemantus ?
as apemantus does now , hate a lord with my heart .
what , thyself ?
ay .
wherefore ?
that i had no angry wit to be a lord .

traffic thy god , and thy god confound thee !
trumpet sounds .

exeunt some attendants you must needs dine with me go not you hence till i have thank you when dinner done , show me this piece .
i am joyful of your sights .
enter alcibiades , with the rest most welcome , sir !
so , so , there !
aches contract and starve your supple joints !

the strain of man bred out into baboon and monkey .

ere we depart , we share a bounteous time in different pleasures .
pray you , let us in .

hang thyself !
no , i will do nothing at thy bidding make thy requests to thy friend .
away , unpeaceable dog , or i spurn thee hence !
i will fly , like a dog , the heels o ' the ass .
exit he opposite to humanity .
come , shall we in , and taste lord timon bounty ?
he outgoes the very heart of kindness .
he pours it out , plutus , the god of gold , is but his steward no meed , but he repays sevenfold above itself , no gift to him , but breeds the giver a return exceeding all use of quittance .
the noblest mind he carries that ever govern man .
long may he live in fortunes !
shall we in ?
i keep you company .
exeunt scene ii .
a in timon house .
hautboys playing loud music .
a great banquet served in , flavius and others attending , then enter timon , alcibiades , lords , senators , and ventidius .
then comes , dropping , after all , apemantus , discontentedly , like himself most honour timon , it hath pleased the gods to remember my father age , and call him to long peace .
he is gone happy , and has left me rich then , as in grateful virtue i am bound to your free heart , i do return those talents , doubled with thanks and service , from whose help i derived liberty .
o , by no means , honest ventidius , you mistake my love i gave it freely ever , and there none can truly say he gives , if he receives if our betters play at that game , we must not dare to imitate them , faults that are rich are fair .
a noble spirit !
nay , my lords , they all stand ceremoniously looking on timon ceremony was but devised at first to set a gloss on faint deeds , hollow welcomes , recanting goodness , sorry ere is shown , but where there is true friendship , there needs none .
pray , sit , more welcome are ye to my fortunes than my fortunes to me .
they sit my lord , we always have confess it .
ho , ho , confess it !
hang it , have you not ?
o , apemantus , you are welcome .
no , you shall not make me welcome i come to have thee thrust me out of doors .
fie , a churl , ye got a humour there does not become a man is much to blame .
they say , my lords , furor brevis est , ' but yond man is ever angry .
go , let him have a table by himself , for he does neither affect company , nor is he fit , indeed .
let me stay at thine apperil , timon i come to observe , i give thee warning o .
i take no heed of thee , an athenian , therefore welcome i myself would have no power , prithee , let my meat make thee silent .
i scorn thy meat , choke me , for i should flatter thee .
o you gods , what a number of men eat timon , and he sees not !
it grieves me to see so many dip their meat in one man blood , and all the madness is , he cheers them up too .
i wonder men dare trust themselves with men methinks they should invite them without knives , good for their meat , and safer for their lives .
there much example , the fellow that sits next him now , parts bread with him , pledges the breath of him in a divided draught , is the readiest man to kill him has been proved .
if i were a huge man , i should fear to drink at meals , lest they should spy my windpipe dangerous notes great men should drink with harness on their throats .
my lord , in heart , and let the health go round .
let it flow this way , my good lord .
flow this way !
a brave fellow !
he keeps his tides well .
those healths will make thee and thy state look ill , timon .
here that which is too weak to be a sinner , honest water , which left man i ' the mire this and my food are equals , there no odds feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods .
apemantus ' grace .
immortal gods , i crave no pelf , i pray for no man but myself grant i may never prove so fond , to trust man on his oath or bond , or a harlot , for her weeping , or a dog , that seems or a keeper with my freedom , or my friends , if i should need .
amen .
so fall rich men sin , and i eat root .
eats and drinks much good dich thy good heart , apemantus !
captain alcibiades , your heart in the field now .
my heart is ever at your service , my lord .
you had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a dinner of friends .
so the were , my lord , there no meat like i could wish my best friend at such a feast .
would all those fatterers were thine enemies then , that then thou mightst kill and bid me to !
might we but have that happiness , my lord , that you would once use our hearts , whereby we might express some part of our zeals , we should think ourselves for ever perfect .
o , no doubt , my good friends , but the gods themselves have provided that i shall have much help from you how had you been my friends else ?
why have you that charitable title from thousands , did not you chiefly belong to my heart ?
i have told more of you to myself than you can with modesty speak in your own behalf , and thus far i confirm you .
o you gods , think i , what need we have any friends , if we should have need of ?
they were the most needless creatures living , should we have use for , and would most resemble sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their sounds to themselves .
why , i have often wished myself poorer , that i might come nearer to you .
we are born to do benefits and what better or properer can we can our own than the riches of our friends ?
o , what a precious comfort is , to have so many , like brothers , commanding one another fortunes !
o joy , made away ere can be born !
mine eyes can not hold out water , methinks to forget their faults , i drink to you .
thou weepest to make them drink , timon .
joy had the like conception in our eyes and at that instant like a babe sprung up .
ho , ho !
i laugh to think that babe a bastard .
i promise you , my lord , you moved me much .
much !
tucket , within what means that trump ?
enter a servant how now ?
please you , my lord , there are certain ladies most desirous of admittance .
ladies !
what are their wills ?
there comes with them a forerunner , my lord , which bears that office , to signify their pleasures .
i pray , let them be admitted .
enter cupid hail to thee , worthy timon , and to all that of his bounties taste !
the five best senses acknowledge thee their patron , and come freely to gratulate thy plenteous bosom th ' ear , taste , touch and smell , pleased from thy tale rise , they only now come but to feast thine eyes .
they welcome all , let have kind admittance music , make their welcome !
exit cupid you see , my lord , how ample you beloved .
music .
cupid with a mask of ladies as amazons , with lutes in their hands , dancing and playing , what a sweep of vanity comes this way !
they dance !
they are mad women .
like madness is the glory of this life .
as this pomp shows to a little oil and root .
we make ourselves fools , to disport ourselves , and spend our flatteries , to drink those men upon whose age we void it up again , with poisonous spite and envy .
who lives that not depraved or depraves ?
who dies , that bears not one spurn to their graves of their friends ' gift ?
i should fear those that dance before me now would one day stamp upon me has been done , men shut their doors against a setting sun .
the lords rise from table , with much adoring of timon , and to show their loves , each singles out an amazon , and all dance , men with women , a lofty strain or two to the hautboys , and cease you have done our pleasures much grace , fair ladies , set a fair fashion on our entertainment , which was not half so beautiful and kind , you have added worth unto and lustre , and entertain me with mine own device , i am to thank you for .
my lord , you take us even at the best .
, for the worst is filthy , and would not hold taking , i doubt me .
ladies , there is an idle banquet attends you please you to dispose yourselves .
most thankfully , my lord .
exeunt cupid and ladies flavius .
my lord ?
the little casket bring me hither .
yes , my lord .
more jewels yet !
there is no crossing him in humour , aside else i should tell him , well , i ' faith i should , when all spent , he be cross then , an he could .
is pity bounty had not eyes behind , that man might be wretched for his mind .
exit where be our men ?
here , my lord , in readiness .
our horses !
flavius , with the casket o my friends , i have one word to say to you look you , my good lord , i must entreat you , honour me so much as to advance this jewel , accept it and wear it , kind my lord .
i am so far already in your gifts , so are we all .
enter a servant my lord , there are certain nobles of the senate newly alighted , and come to visit you .
they are fairly welcome .
i beseech your honour , vouchsafe me a word , it does concern you near .
near !
why then , another time i hear thee i prithee , let be provided to show them entertainment .
aside i scarce know how .
enter a second servant may it please your honour , lord lucius , out of his free love , hath presented to you four horses , trapp in silver .
i shall accept them fairly , let the presents be worthily entertain .
enter a third servant how now !
what news ?
please you , my lord , that honourable gentleman , lord lucullus , entreats your company to hunt with him , and has sent your honour two brace of greyhounds .
i hunt with him , and let them be received , not without fair reward .
aside what will this come to ?
he commands us to provide , and give great gifts , and all out of an empty coffer nor will he know his purse , or yield me this , to show him what a beggar his heart is , being of no power to make his wishes good his promises fly so beyond his state that what he speaks is all in debt , he owes for every word he is so kind that he now pays interest for , his land put to their books .
well , would i were gently put out of office before i were forced out !
happier is he that has no friend to feed than such that do enemies exceed .
i bleed inwardly for my lord .
exit you do yourselves much wrong , you bate too much of your own merits here , my lord , a trifle of our love .
with more than common thanks i will receive it .
o , he the very soul of bounty !
and now i remember , my lord , you gave good words the other day of a bay courser i rode on it is yours , because you liked it .
o , i beseech you , pardon me , my lord , in that .
you may take my word , my lord , i know , no man can justly praise but what he does affect i weigh my friend affection with mine own , i tell you true .
i call to you .
o , none so welcome .
i take all and your several visitations so kind to heart , is not enough to give , methinks , i could deal kingdoms to my friends , and be weary .
alcibiades , thou art a soldier , therefore seldom rich , it comes in charity to thee for all thy living is the dead , and all the lands thou hast lie in a pitch field .
ay , defiled land , my lord .
we are so virtuously bound and so am i to you .
so infinitely endear all to you .
lights , more lights !
the best of happiness , honour and fortunes , keep with you , lord timon !
ready for his friends .
exeunt all but apemantus and timon what a coil here !
serving of becks and of bums !
i doubt whether their legs be worth the sums that are given for .
friendship full of dregs methinks , false hearts should never have sound legs , thus honest fools lay out their wealth on .
now , apemantus , if thou wert not sullen , i would be good to thee .
no , i nothing for if i should be bribed too , there would be none left to rail upon thee , and then thou wouldst sin the faster .
thou givest so long , timon , i fear me thou wilt give away thyself in paper shortly what need these feasts , pomps and ?
nay , an you begin to rail on society once , i am sworn not to give regard to you .
farewell , and come with better music .
exit so thou wilt not hear me now , thou shalt not then i lock thy heaven from thee .
o , that men ears should be to counsel deaf , but not to flattery !
exit act ii scene i .
a senator house .
enter senator , with papers in his hand and late , five thousand to varro and to isidore he owes nine thousand , besides my former sum , which makes it five and twenty .
still in motion of raging waste ?
it can not hold , it will not .
if i want gold , steal but a beggar dog , and give it timon , why , the dog coins gold .
if i would sell my horse , and buy twenty more better than he , why , give my horse to timon , ask nothing , give it him , it foals me , straight , and able horses .
no porter at his gate , but rather one that smiles and still invites all that pass by .
it can not hold no reason can found his state in safety .
caphis , ho !
caphis , i say !
enter caphis here , sir , what is your pleasure ?
get on your cloak , and haste you to lord timon , importune him for my moneys , be not ceased with slight denial , nor then silenced when me to your master ' and the cap plays in the right hand , thus but tell him , my uses cry to me , i must serve my turn out of mine own , his days and times are past and my reliances on his fracted dates have smit my credit i love and honour him , but must not break my back to heal his finger , immediate are my needs , and my relief must not be toss and turn to me in words , but find supply immediate .
get you gone put on a most importunate aspect , a visage of demand , for , i do fear , when every feather sticks in his own wing , lord timon will be left a naked gull , which flashes now a phoenix .
get you gone .
i go , sir .
' i go , sir ! '
take the bonds along with you , and have the dates in contempt .
i will , sir .

exeunt alcibiades and lords to flavius come hither pray you , how goes the world , that i am thus encounter with clamourous demands of bonds , and the detention of debts , against my honour ?
please you , gentlemen , the time is unagreeable to this business your importunacy cease till after dinner , that i may make his lordship understand wherefore you are not paid .

exit enter apemantus and fool stay , stay , here comes the fool with apemantus let ha ' some sport with .
varro servant hang him , he abuse us .
isidore servant a plague upon him , dog !
varro servant how dost , fool ?
dost dialogue with thy shadow ?
varro servant i speak not to thee .
no , is to thyself .
to the fool come away .
isidore servant there the fool hangs on your back already .
no , thou single , not on him yet .
where the fool now ?
he last asked the question .
poor rogues , and usurers ' men !
bawds between gold and want !
what are we , apemantus ?
asses .
why ?
that you ask me what you are , and do not know yourselves .
speak to , fool .
how do you , gentlemen ?
gramercies , good fool how does your mistress ?
she setting on water to scald such chickens as you are .
would we could see you at corinth !
good !
gramercy .
enter page look you , here comes my mistress ' page .
to the fool why , how now , captain !
what do you in this wise company ?
how dost thou , apemantus ?
would i had a rod in my mouth , that i might answer thee profitably .
prithee , apemantus , read me the superscription of these letters i know not which is which .
canst not read ?
no .
there will little learning die then , that day thou art hanged .
this is to lord timon , this to alcibiades .
go , thou wast born a bastard , and die a bawd .
thou wast whelped a dog , and thou shalt famish a dog death .
answer not , i am gone .
exit so thou outrunnest grace .
fool , i will go with you to lord timon .
will you leave me there ?
if timon stay at home .
you three serve three usurers ?
ay , would they served us !
so would i , as good a trick as ever hangman served thief .
are you three usurers ' men ?
ay , fool .
i think no usurer but has a fool to his servant my mistress is one , and i am her fool .
when men come to borrow of your masters , they approach sadly , and go away merry , but they enter my mistress ' house merrily , and go away sadly the reason of this ?
varro servant i could render one .
do it then , that we may account thee a whoremaster and a knave , which , thou shalt be no less esteemed .
varro servant what is a whoremaster , fool ?
a fool in good clothes , and something like thee .
is a spirit appears like a lord , sometime like a lawyer , sometime like a philosopher , with two stones moe than artificial one he is very often like a knight , and , generally , in all shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore to thirteen , this spirit walks in .
varro servant thou art not altogether a fool .
nor thou altogether a wise man as much foolery as i have , so much wit thou lackest .
that answer might have become apemantus .
aside , aside , here comes lord timon .
timon and flavius come with me , fool , come .
i do not always follow lover , elder brother and woman , sometime the philosopher .
exeunt apemantus and fool pray you , walk near i speak with you anon .
exeunt servants you make me marvel wherefore ere this time had you not fully laid my state before me , that i might so have rated my expense , as i had leave of means ?
you would not hear me , at many leisures i proposed .
go to perchance some single vantages you took .
when my indispos ition put you back and that unaptness made your minister , thus to excuse yourself .
o my good lord , at many times i brought in my accounts , laid them before you , you would throw them off , and say , you found them in mine honesty .
when , for some trifling present , you have bid me return so much , i have shook my head and wept , yea , the authority of manners , pray you to hold your hand more close i did endure not seldom , nor no slight cheques , when i have prompted you in the ebb of your estate and your great flow of debts .
my loved lord , though you hear now , too late yet now a time the greatest of your having lacks a half to pay your present debts .
let all my land be sold .
is all engaged , some forfeited and gone , and what remains will hardly stop the mouth of present dues the future comes apace what shall defend the interim ?
and at length how goes our reckoning ?
to lacedaemon did my land extend .
o my good lord , the world is but a word were it all yours to give it in a breath , how quickly were it gone !
you tell me true .
if you suspect my husbandry or falsehood , call me before the exactest auditors and set me on the proof .
so the gods bless me , when all our offices have been oppress with riotous feeders , when our vaults have wept with drunken spilth of wine , when every room hath blazed with lights and bray with minstrelsy , i have retired me to a wasteful cock , and set mine eyes at flow .
prithee , no more .
heavens , have i said , the bounty of this lord !
how many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants this night englutted !
who is not timon ?

come , sermon me no further no villanous bounty yet hath pass my heart , unwisely , not ignobly , have i given .
why dost thou weep ?
canst thou the conscience lack , to think i shall lack friends ?
secure thy heart , if i would broach the vessels of my love , and try the argument of hearts by borrowing , men and men fortunes could i frankly use as i can bid thee speak .

hum !
go you , sir , to the senators of whom , even to the state best health , i have deserved this hearing bid send o ' the instant a thousand talents to me .
i have been bold for that i knew it the most general way to them to use your signet and your name , but they do shake their heads , and i am here no richer in return .
true ?
ca be ?
they answer , in a joint and corporate voice , that now they are at fall , want treasure , can not do what they would , are sorry you are honourable , but yet they could have wish they know not something hath been amiss a noble nature may catch a wrench would all were well is pity , and so , intending other serious matters , after distasteful looks and these hard fractions , with certain and nods they froze me into silence .
you gods , reward them !
prithee , man , look cheerly .
these old fellows have their ingratitude in them hereditary their blood is caked , is cold , it seldom flows , is lack of kindly warmth they are not kind , and nature , as it grows again toward earth , is fashion for the journey , dull and heavy .
to a servant go to ventidius .
to flavius prithee , be not sad , thou art true and honest , ingeniously i speak .
no blame belongs to thee .
to servant ventidius lately buried his father , by whose death he stepp into a great estate when he was poor , imprison and in scarcity of friends , i clear him with five talents greet him from me , bid him suppose some good necessity touches his friend , which craves to be remember with those five talents .
exit servant to flavius that had , these fellows to whom is instant due .
speak , or think , that timon fortunes his friends can sink .
i would i could not think it that thought is bounty foe , being free itself , it thinks all others so .
exeunt act iii scene i .
a room in lucullus ' house .
flaminius waiting .
enter a servant to him i have told my lord of you , he is coming down to you .
i thank you , sir .
enter lucullus here my lord .
aside one of lord timon men ?
a gift , i warrant .
why , this hits right , i dreamt of a silver basin and ewer .
flaminius , honest flaminius , you are very respectively welcome , sir .
fill me some wine .
exit servants and how does that honourable , complete , gentleman of athens , thy very bountiful good lord and master ?
his health is well sir .
i am right glad that his health is well , sir and what hast thou there under thy cloak , pretty flaminius ?
, nothing but an empty box , sir , which , in my lord behalf , i come to entreat your honour to supply , who , having great and instant occasion to use fifty talents , hath sent to your lordship to furnish him , nothing doubting your present assistance therein .
la , la , la , la !
doubting , ' says he ?
alas , good lord !
a noble gentleman is , if he would not keep so good a house .
many a time and often i ha ' dined with him , and told him o , and come again to supper to him , of purpose to have him spend less , and yet he would embrace no counsel , take no warning by my coming .
every man has his fault , and honesty is his i ha ' told him o , but i could get him .
servant , with wine please your lordship , here is the wine .
flaminius , i have noted thee always wise .
here to thee .
your lordship speaks your pleasure .
i have observed thee always for a towardly prompt spirit give thee thy due and one that knows what belongs to reason , and canst use the time well , if the time use thee well good parts in thee .
to servant get you gone , sirrah .
exit servant draw nearer , honest flaminius .
thy lord a bountiful gentleman but thou art wise , and thou knowest well enough , although thou comest to me , that this is no time to lend money , especially upon bare friendship , without security .
here three solidares for thee good boy , wink at me , and say thou sawest me not .
fare thee well .
possible the world should so much differ , and we alive that lived ?
fly , damned baseness , to him that worships thee !
throwing the money back ha !
now i see thou art a fool , and fit for thy master .
exit may these add to the number that may scald thee !
let moulten coin be thy damnation , thou disease of a friend , and not himself !
has friendship such a faint and milky heart , it turns in less than two nights ?
o you gods , i feel master passion !
this slave , unto his honour , has my lord meat in him why should it thrive and turn to nutriment , when he is turn to poison ?
o , may diseases only work upo !
and , when he sick to death , let not that part of nature which my lord paid for , be of any power to expel sickness , but prolong his hour !
exit scene ii .
a public place .
enter lucilius , with three strangers who , the lord timon ?
he is my very good friend , and an honourable gentleman .
we know him for no less , though we are but strangers to him .
but i can tell you one thing , my lord , and which i hear from common rumours now lord timon happy hours are done and past , and his estate shrinks from him .
fie , no , do not believe it , he can not want for money .
but believe you this , my lord , that , not long ago , one of his men was with the lord lucullus to borrow so many talents , nay , urged extremely and showed what necessity belonged , and yet was denied .
how !
i tell you , denied , my lord .
what a strange case was that !
now , before the gods , i am ashamed o .
denied that honourable man !
there was very little honour showed i .
for my own part , i must needs confess , i have received some small kindnesses from him , as money , plate , jewels and trifles , nothing comparing to his , yet , had he mistook him and sent to me , i should have denied his occasion so many talents .
enter servilius see , by good hap , yonder my lord , i have sweat to see his honour .
my honoured lord , to lucius servilius !
you are kindly met , sir .
fare thee well commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord , my very exquisite friend .
may it please your honour , my lord hath sent ha !
what has he sent ?
i am so much endeared to that lord , he ever sending how shall i thank him , thinkest thou ?
and what has he sent now ?
has only sent his present occasion now , my lord , requesting your lordship to supply his instant use with so many talents .
i know his lordship is but merry with me , he can not want fifty five hundred talents .
but in the mean time he wants less , my lord .
if his occasion were not virtuous , i should not urge it half so faithfully .
dost thou speak seriously , servilius ?
upon my soul , is true , sir .
what a wicked beast was i to disfurnish myself against such a good time , when i might ha ' shown myself honourable !
how unluckily it happened , that i should purchase the day before for a little part , and undo a great deal of honoured !
servilius , now , before the gods , i am not able to do , the more beast , i say i was sending to use lord timon myself , these gentlemen can witness !
but i would not , for the wealth of athens , i had now .
commend me bountifully to his good lordship , and i hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me , because i have no power to be kind and tell him this from me , i count it one of my greatest afflictions , say , that i can not pleasure such an honourable gentleman .
good servilius , will you befriend me so far , as to use mine own words to him ?
yes , sir , i shall .
i look you out a good turn , servilius .
exit servilius true as you said , timon is shrunk indeed , and he that once denied will hardly speed .
exit do you observe this , hostilius ?
ay , too well .
why , this is the world soul , and just of the same piece is every flatterer spirit .
who can call him his friend that dips in the same dish ?
for , in my knowing , timon has been this lord father , and kept his credit with his purse , supported his estate , nay , timon money has paid his men their wages he drinks , but timon silver treads upon his lip , and yet o , see the monstrousness of man when he looks out in an ungrateful shape ! he does deny him , in respect of his , what charitable men afford to beggars .
religion groans at it .
for mine own part , i never tasted timon in my life , nor came any of his bounties over me , to mark me for his friend , yet , i protest , for his right noble mind , illustrious virtue and honourable carriage , had his necessity made use of me , i would have put my wealth into donation , and the best half should have return to him , so much i love his heart but , i perceive , men must learn now with pity to dispense , for policy sits above conscience .
exeunt scene iii .
a room in sempronius ' house .
enter sempronius , and a servant of timon must he needs trouble me in , hum ! all others ?
he might have tried lord lucius or lucullus , and now ventidius is wealthy too , whom he redeem from prison all these owe their estates unto him .
my lord , they have all been touch and found base metal , for they have au denied him .
how !
have they denied him ?
has ventidius and lucullus denied him ?
and does he send to me ?
three ?
hum !
it shows but little love or judgment in him must i be his last refuge !
his friends , like physicians , thrive , give him over must i take the cure upon me ?
has much disgraced me i , i angry at him , that might have known my place i see no sense , but his occasion might have woo me first , for , in my conscience , i was the first man that received gift from him and does he think so backwardly of me now , that i requite its last ?
no so it may prove an argument of laughter to the rest , and lords i be thought a fool .
rather than the worth of thrice the sum , had sent to me first , but for my mind sake , i such a courage to do him good .
but now return , and with their faint reply this answer join , who bates mine honour shall not know my coin .
exit excellent !
your lordship a goodly villain .
the devil knew not what he did when he made man politic , he crossed himself by and i can not think but , in the end , the villainies of man will set him clear .
how fairly this lord strives to appear foul !
takes virtuous copies to be wicked , like those that under hot ardent zeal would set whole realms on fire of such a nature is his politic love .
this was my lord best hope , now all are fled , save only the gods now his friends are dead , doors , that were acquainted with their wards many a bounteous year must be employ now to guard sure their master .
and this is all a liberal course allows , who can not keep his wealth must keep his house .

a hall in timon house .
enter two servants of varro , and the servant of lucius , meeting titus , hortensius , and other servants of timon creditors , waiting his coming out well met , good morrow , titus and hortensius .
the like to you kind varro .
lucius !
what , do we meet together ?
lucilius ' servant ay , and i think one business does command us all , for mine is money .
so is theirs and ours .
enter philotus lucilius ' servant and sir philotus too !
good day at once .
lucilius ' servant welcome , good brother .
what do you think the hour ?
labouring for nine .
lucilius ' servant so much ?
is not my lord seen yet ?
lucilius ' servant not yet .
i wonder o , he was wont to shine at seven .
lucilius ' servant ay , but the days are wax shorter with him you must consider that a prodigal course is like the sun , but not , like his , recoverable .
i fear is deepest winter in lord timon purse , that is one may reach deep enough , and yet find little .
i am of your fear for that .
i show you how to observe a strange event .
your lord sends now for money .
most true , he does .
and he wears jewels now of timon gift , for which i wait for money .
it is against my heart .
lucilius ' servant mark , how strange it shows , timon in this should pay more than he owes and as if your lord should wear rich jewels , and send for money for .
i weary of this charge , the gods can witness i know my lord hath spent of timon wealth , and now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth .
yes , mine three thousand crowns what yours ?
lucilius ' servant five thousand mine .
is much deep and it should seem by the sun , your master confidence was above mine , else , surely , his had equall .
enter flaminius .
one of lord timon men .
lucilius ' servant flaminius !
sir , a word pray , is my lord ready to come forth ?
no , indeed , he is not .
we attend his lordship , pray , signify so much .
i need not tell him that , he knows you are too diligent .
exit enter flavius in a cloak , muffled lucilius ' servant ha !
is not that his steward muffled so ?
he goes away in a cloud call him , call him .
do you hear , sir ?
by your leave , sir , what do ye ask of me , my friend ?
we wait for certain money here , sir .
ay , if money were as certain as your waiting , sure enough .
why then preferr you not your sums and bills , when your false masters eat of my lord meat ?
then they could smile and fawn upon his debts and take down the interest into their gluttonous maws .
you do yourselves but wrong to stir me up , let me pass quietly believe , my lord and i have made an end , i have no more to reckon , he to spend .
lucilius ' servant ay , but this answer will not serve .
if not serve , is not so base as you , for you serve knaves .
exit how !
what does his cashiered worship mutter ?
no matter what , he poor , and that revenge enough .
who can speak broader than he that has no house to put his head in ?
such may rail against great buildings .
enter servilius o , here servilius , now we shall know some answer .
if i might beseech you , gentlemen , to repair some other hour , i should derive much , for , of my soul , my lord leans wondrously to discontent his comfortable temper has forsook him , he much out of health , and keeps his chamber .
lucilius ' servant many do keep their chambers are not sick and , if it be so far beyond his health , methinks he should the sooner pay his debts , and make a clear way to the gods .
good gods !
we can not take this for answer , sir .
within servilius , help !
my lord !
my lord !
enter timon , in a rage , flaminius following what , are my doors opposed against my passage ?
have i been ever free , and must my house be my retentive enemy , my gaol ?
the place which i have feasted , does it now , like all mankind , show me an iron heart ?
lucilius ' servant put in now , titus .
my lord , here is my bill .
lucilius ' servant here mine .
and mine , my lord .
both varro servants and ours , my lord .
all our bills .
knock me down with cleave me to the girdle .
lucilius ' servant alas , my lord , - cut my heart in sums .
mine , fifty talents .
tell out my blood .
lucilius ' servant five thousand crowns , my lord .
five thousand drops pays that .
what yours ? and yours ?
my lord , my lord , tear me , take me , and the gods fall upon you !
exit , i perceive our masters may throw their caps at their money these debts may well be called desperate ones , for a madman owes .
exeunt timon and flavius they have put my breath from me , the slaves .
creditors ?
devils !
my dear lord , what if it should be so ?
my lord , i have it so .
my steward !
here , my lord .
so fitly ?
go , bid all my friends again , lucius , lucullus , and sempronius all , sirrah , all i once more feast the rascals .
o my lord , you only speak from your distracted soul , there is not so much left , to furnish out a moderate table .
not in thy care , go , i charge thee , invite them all let in the tide of knaves once more , my cook and i provide .
exeunt scene the same .
the .
the senate sitting .
my lord , you have my voice to it , the fault bloody , is necessary he should die nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy .
most true , the law shall bruise him .
enter alcibiades , with attendants honour , health , and compassion to the senate !
now , captain ?
i am an humble suitor to your virtues , for pity is the virtue of the law , and none but tyrants use it cruelly .
it pleases time and fortune to lie heavy upon a friend of mine , who , in hot blood , hath stepp into the law , which is past depth to those that , without heed , do plunge into .
he is a man , setting his fate aside , of comely virtues nor did he soil the fact with cowardice an honour in him which buys out his fault but with a noble fury and fair spirit , seeing his reputation touch to death , he did oppose his foe and with such sober and unnoted passion he did behave his anger , ere was spent , as if he had but proved an argument .
you undergo too strict a paradox , striving to make an ugly deed look fair your words have took such pains as if they labour to bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling upon the head of valour , which indeed is valour misbegot and came into the world when sects and factions were newly born he truly valiant that can wisely suffer the worst that man can breathe , and make his wrongs his outsides , to wear them like his raiment , carelessly , and prefer his injuries to his heart , to bring it into danger .
if wrongs be evils and enforce us kill , what folly is to hazard life for ill !
my lord , you can not make gross sins look clear to revenge is no valour , but to bear .
my lords , then , under favour , pardon me , if i speak like a captain .
why do fond men expose themselves to battle , and not endure all threats ?
sleep upo , and let the foes quietly cut their throats , without repugnancy ?
if there be such valour in the bearing , what make we abroad ?
why then , women are more valiant that stay at home , if bearing carry it , and the ass more captain than the lion , the felon loaden with irons wiser than the judge , if wisdom be in suffering .
o my lords , as you are great , be pitifully good who can not condemn rashness in cold blood ?
to kill , i grant , is sin extremest gust , but , in defence , by mercy , is most just .
to be in anger is impiety , but who is man that is not angry ?
weigh but the crime with this .
you breathe in vain .
in vain !
his service done at lacedaemon and byzantium were a sufficient briber for his life .
what that ?
i say , my lords , he has done fair service , and slain in fight many of your enemies how full of valour did he bear himself in the last conflict , and made plenteous wounds !
he has made too much plenty with , he a sworn rioter he has a sin that often drowns him , and takes his valour prisoner if there were no foes , that were enough to overcome him in that beastly fury he has been known to commit outrages , and cherish factions is inferr to us , his days are foul and his drink dangerous .
he dies .
hard fate !
he might have died in war .
my lords , if not for any parts in him though his right arm might purchase his own time and be in debt to none yet , more to move you , take my deserts to his , and join both and , for i know your reverend ages love security , i pawn my victories , all my honours to you , upon his good returns .
if by this crime he owes the law his life , why , let the war receive in valiant gore for law is strict , and war is nothing more .
we are for law he dies , urge it no more , on height of our displeasure friend or brother , he forfeits his own blood that spills another .
must it be so ?
it must not be .
my lords , i do beseech you , know me .
how !
call me to your remembrances .
what !
i can not think but your age has forgot me , it could not else be , i should prove so base , to sue , and be denied such common grace my wounds ache at you .
do you dare our anger ?
is in few words , but spacious in effect , we banish thee for ever .
banish me !
banish your dotage , banish usury , that makes the senate ugly .
if , after two days ' shine , athens contain thee , attend our weightier judgment .
and , not to swell our spirit , he shall be executed presently .
exeunt senators now the gods keep you old enough , that you may live only in bone , that none may look on you !
i worse than mad i have kept back their foes , while they have told their money and let out their coin upon large interest , i myself rich only in large hurts .
all those for this ?
is this the balsam that the usuring senate pours into captains ' wounds ?
banishment !
it comes not ill , i hate not to be banish , it is a cause worthy my spleen and fury , that i may strike at athens .
i cheer up my discontented troops , and lay for hearts .
is honour with most lands to be at odds , soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods .

enter divers lords , senators and others , at several doors the good time of day to you , sir .
i also wish it to you .
i think this honourable lord did but try us this other day .
upon that were my thoughts tiring , when we encountered i hope it is not so low with him as he made it seem in the trial of his several friends .
it should not be , by the persuasion of his new feasting .
i should think so he hath sent me an earnest inviting , which many my near occasions did urge me to put off , but he hath conjured me beyond them , and i must needs appear .
in like manner was i in debt to my importunate business , but he would not hear my excuse .
i am sorry , when he sent to borrow of me , that my provision was out .
i am sick of that grief too , as i understand how all things go .
every man here so .
what would he have borrowed of you ?
a thousand pieces .
a thousand pieces !
what of you ?
he sent to me , sir , here he comes .
enter timon and attendants with all my heart , gentlemen both , and how fare you ?
ever at the best , hearing well of your lordship .
the swallow follows not summer more willing than we your lordship .
aside nor more willingly leaves winter , such are men .
gentlemen , our dinner will not recompense this long stay feast your ears with the music awhile , if they will fare so harshly o ' the trumpet sound , we shall to presently .
i hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship that i returned you an empty messenger .
o , sir , let it not trouble you .
my noble lord , ah , my good friend , what cheer ?
my most honourable lord , i am sick of shame , that , when your lordship this other day sent to me , i was so unfortunate a beggar .
think not on , sir .
if you had sent but two hours before , let it not cumber your better remembrance .
the banquet brought in come , bring in all together .
all covered dishes !
royal cheer , i warrant you .
doubt not that , if money and the season can yield it .
how do you ?
what the news ?
alcibiades is banished hear you of it ?
alcibiades banished !
is so , be sure of it .
how !
how !
i pray you , upon what ?
my worthy friends , will you draw near ?
i tell you more anon .
here a noble feast toward .
this is the old man still .
will hold ?
will hold ?
it does but time will and so i do conceive .
each man to his stool , with that spur as he would to the lip of his mistress your diet shall be in all places alike .
make not a city feast of it , to let the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place sit , sit .
the gods require our thanks .
you great benefactors , sprinkle our society with thankfulness .
for your own gifts , make yourselves praised but reserve still to give , lest your deities be despised .
lend to each man enough , that one need not lend to another , for , were your godheads to borrow of men , men would forsake the gods .
make the meat be beloved more than the man that gives it .
let no assembly of twenty be without a score of villains if there sit twelve women at the table , let a dozen of them be as they are .
the rest of your fees , o gods the senators of athens , together with the common lag of people what is amiss in them , you gods , make suitable for destruction .
for these my present friends , as they are to me nothing , so in nothing bless them , and to nothing are they welcome .
uncover , dogs , and lap .
the dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water what does his lordship mean ?
i know not .
may you a better feast never behold , you knot of i smoke and lukewarm water is your perfection .
this is timon last , who , stuck and spangled with your flatteries , washes it off , and sprinkles in your faces your reeking villany .
throwing the water in their faces live loathed and long , most smiling , smooth , detested parasites , courteous destroyers , affable wolves , meek bears , you fools of fortune , , time flies , cap and knee slaves , vapours , and !
of man and beast the infinite malady crust you quite !
what , dost thou go ?
soft !
take thy physic first thou too and thou , stay , i will lend thee money , borrow none .
throws the dishes at them , and drives them out what , all in motion ?
henceforth be no feast , whereat a villain not a welcome guest .
burn , house !
sink , athens !
henceforth hated be of timon man and all humanity !
exit the lords , senators , and c how now , my lords !
know you the quality of lord timon fury ?

did you see my cap ?
i have lost my gown .
he but a mad lord , and nought but humour sways him .
he gave me a jewel th ' other day , and now he has beat it out of my hat did you see my jewel ?

o thou wall , that girdlest in those wolves , dive in the earth , and fence not athens !
matrons , turn incontinent !
obedience fail in children !
slaves and fools , pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench , and minister in their steads !
to general filths convert o ' the instant , green virginity , do in your parents ' eyes !

son of sixteen , pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire , with it beat out his brains !
piety , and fear , religion to the gods , peace , justice , truth , domestic awe , , and neighbourhood , instruction , manners , mysteries , and trades , degrees , observances , customs , and laws , decline to your confounding contraries , and let confusion live !
plagues , incident to men , your potent and infectious fevers heap on athens , ripe for stroke !
thou cold sciatica , cripple our senators , that their limbs may halt as lamely as their manners .
lust and liberty creep in the minds and marrows of our youth , that the stream of virtue they may strive , and drown themselves in riot !
itches , blains , sow all the athenian bosoms , and their crop be general leprosy !
breath infect breath , at their society , as their friendship , may merely poison !
nothing i bear from thee , but nakedness , thou detestable town !
take thou that too , with multiplying bans !
timon will to the woods , where he shall find the unkindest beast more kinder than mankind .

are we undone ?
cast off ?
nothing remaining ?
alack , my fellows , what should i say to you ?
let me be recorded by the righteous gods , i am as poor as you .
such a house broke !
so noble a master !
all gone !
and not one friend to take his fortune by the arm , and go along with him !
as we do turn our backs from our companion thrown into his grave , so his familiars to his buried fortunes slink all away , leave their false vows with him , like empty purses pick , and his poor self , a dedicated beggar to the air , with his disease of poverty , walks , like contempt , alone .
more of our fellows .
enter other servants all broken implements of a ruin house .
yet do our hearts wear timon livery , that see i by our faces , we are fellows still , serving alike in sorrow leak is our bark , and we , poor mates , stand on the dying deck , hearing the surges threat we must all part into this sea of air .
good fellows all , the latest of my wealth i share amongst you .
wherever we shall meet , for timon sake , let yet be fellows , let shake our heads , and say , as a knell unto our master fortunes , have seen better days . '
let each take some , nay , put out all your hands .
not one word more thus part we rich in sorrow , parting poor .
servants embrace , and part several ways o , the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us !
who would not wish to be from wealth exempt , since riches point to misery and contempt ?
who would be so mock with glory ?
or to live but in a dream of friendship ?
to have his pomp and all what state compounds but only painted , like his varnish friends ?
poor honest lord , brought low by his own heart , undone by goodness !
strange , unusual blood , when man worst sin is , he does too much good !
who , then , dares to be half so kind again ?
for bounty , that makes gods , does still mar men .
my dearest lord , bless , to be most accursed , rich , only to be wretched , thy great fortunes are made thy chief afflictions .
alas , kind lord !
he flung in rage from this ingrateful seat of monstrous friends , nor has he with him to supply his life , or that which can command it .
i follow and inquire him out i ever serve his mind with my best will , whilst i have gold , i be his steward still .

enter timon , from the cave o blessed breeding sun , draw from the earth rotten humidity , below thy sister orb infect the air !
twinn brothers of one womb , whose procreation , residence , and birth , scarce is dividant , touch them with several fortunes , the greater scorns the lesser not nature , to whom all sores lay siege , can bear great fortune , but by contempt of nature .
raise me this beggar , and deny that lord , the senator shall bear contempt hereditary , the beggar native honour .
it is the pasture lards the rother sides , the want that makes him lean .
who dares , who dares , in purity of manhood stand upright , and say man a flatterer ? '
if one be , so are they all , for every grise of fortune is smooth by that below the learned pate ducks to the golden fool all is oblique , there nothing level in our cursed natures , but direct villany .
therefore , be abhorr all feasts , societies , and throngs of men !
his semblable , yea , himself , timon disdains destruction fang mankind !
earth , yield me roots !
digging who seeks for better of thee , sauce his palate with thy most operant poison !
what is here ?
gold ?
yellow , glittering , precious gold ?
no , gods , i am no idle votarist roots , you clear heavens !
thus much of this will make black white , foul fair , wrong right , base noble , old young , coward valiant .
ha , you gods !
why this ?
what this , you gods ?
why , this will lug your priests and servants from your sides , pluck stout men pillows from below their heads this yellow slave will knit and break religions , bless the accursed , make the hoar leprosy adored , place thieves and give them title , knee and approbation with senators on the bench this is it that makes the wappen widow wed again , she , whom the and ulcerous sores would cast the gorge at , this embalms and spices to the april day again .
come , damned earth , thou common whore of mankind , that odds among the route of nations , i will make thee do thy right nature .
march afar off ha !
a drum ?
quick , but yet i bury thee go , strong thief , when gouty keepers of thee can not stand .
nay , stay thou out for earnest .
keeping some gold enter alcibiades , with drum and fife , in warlike manner , phrynia and timandra what art thou there ?
speak .
a beast , as thou art .
the canker gnaw thy heart , for showing me again the eyes of man !
what is thy name ?
is man so hateful to thee , that art thyself a man ?
i am misanthropos , and hate mankind .
for thy part , i do wish thou wert a dog , that i might love thee something .
i know thee well , but in thy fortunes am unlearn and strange .
i know thee too , and more than that i know thee , i not desire to know .
follow thy drum , with man blood paint the ground , gules , gules religious canons , civil laws are cruel , then what should war be ?
this fell whore of thine hath in her more destruction than thy sword , for all her cherubim look .
thy lips rot off !
i will not kiss thee , then the rot returns to thine own lips again .
how came the noble timon to this change ?
as the moon does , by wanting light to give but then renew i could not , like the moon , there were no suns to borrow of .
noble timon , what friendship may i do thee ?
none , but to maintain my opinion .
what is it , timon ?
promise me friendship , but perform none if thou wilt not promise , the gods plague thee , for thou art a man !
if thou dost perform , confound thee , for thou art a man !
i have heard in some sort of thy miseries .
thou them , when i had prosperity .
i see them now , then was a blessed time .
as thine is now , held with a brace of harlots .
is this the athenian minion , whom the world voiced so regardfully ?
art thou timandra ?
yes .
be a whore still they love thee not that use thee , give them diseases , leaving with thee their lust .
make use of thy salt hours season the slaves for tubs and baths , bring down youth to the and the diet .
hang thee , monster !
pardon him , sweet timandra , for his wits are drown and lost in his calamities .
i have but little gold of late , brave timon , the want whereof doth daily make revolt in my penurious band i have heard , and grieved , how cursed athens , mindless of thy worth , forgetting thy great deeds , when neighbour states , but for thy sword and fortune , trod upon them , i prithee , beat thy drum , and get thee gone .
i am thy friend , and pity thee , dear timon .
how dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble ?
i had rather be alone .
why , fare thee well here is some gold for thee .
keep it , i can not eat it .
when i have laid proud athens on a heap , thou athens ?
ay , timon , and have cause .
the gods confound them all in thy conquest , and thee after , when thou hast conquer !
why me , timon ?
that , by killing of villains , thou wast born to conquer my country .
put up thy gold go on , here gold , go on , be as a planetary plague , when jove will some city hang his poison in the sick air let not thy sword skip one pity not honour age for his white beard , he is an usurer strike me the counterfeit matron , it is her habit only that is honest , herself a bawd let not the virgin cheek make soft thy trenchant sword , for those , that through the bore at men eyes , are not within the leaf of pity writ , but set them down horrible traitors spare not the babe , whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy , think it a bastard , whom the oracle hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut , and mince it sans remorse swear against objects , put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes , whose proof , nor yells of mothers , maids , nor babes , nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding , shall pierce a jot .
there gold to pay soldiers make large confusion , and , thy fury spent , confounded be thyself !
speak not , be gone .
hast thou gold yet ?
i take the gold thou givest me , not all thy counsel .
dost thou , or dost thou not , heaven curse upon thee !
give us some gold , good timon hast thou more ?
enough to make a whore forswear her trade , and to make whores , a bawd .
hold up , you sluts , your aprons mountant you are not oathable , although , i know , you swear , terribly swear into strong shudders and to heavenly agues the immortal gods that hear you , spare your oaths , i trust to your conditions be whores still , and he whose pious breath seeks to convert you , be strong in whore , allure him , burn him up , let your close fire predominate his smoke , and be no turncoats yet may your pains , six months , be quite contrary and thatch your poor thin roofs with burthens of the dead , some that were hang , no matter wear them , betray with them whore still , paint till a horse may mire upon your face , a pox of wrinkles !
well , more gold what then ?
, that we do any thing for gold .
consumptions sow in hollow bones of man , strike their sharp shins , and mar men spurring .
crack the lawyer voice , that he may never more false title plead , nor sound his quillets shrilly hoar the flamen , that scolds against the quality of flesh , and not believes himself down with the nose , down with it flat , take the bridge quite away of him that , his particular to foresee , smells from the general weal make ruffians bald , and let the unscarr braggarts of the war derive some pain from you plague all , that your activity may defeat and quell the source of all erection .
there more gold do you damn others , and let this damn you , and ditches grave you all !
more counsel with more money , bounteous timon .
more whore , more mischief first , i have given you earnest .
strike up the drum towards athens !
farewell , timon if i thrive well , i visit thee again .
if i hope well , i never see thee more .
i never did thee harm .
yes , thou spokest well of me .
thou that harm ?
men daily find it .
get thee away , and take thy beagles with thee .
we but offend him .
strike !
drum beats .
exeunt alcibiades , phrynia , and timandra that nature , being sick of man unkindness , should yet be hungry !
common mother , thou , digging whose womb unmeasurable , and infinite breast , teems , and feeds all , whose mettle , whereof thy proud child , arrogant man , is puff , engenders the black toad and adder blue , the gilded newt and eyeless venom worm , with all the abhorred births below crisp heaven whereon hyperion quickening fire doth shine , yield him , who all thy human sons doth hate , from forth thy plenteous bosom , one poor root !
ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb , let it no more bring out ingrateful man !
go great with tigers , dragons , wolves , and bears , teem with new monsters , whom thy upward face hath to the marbled mansion all above never presented ! o , a root , dear thanks ! dry up thy marrows , vines , and leas , whereof ungrateful man , with liquorish draughts and morsels unctuous , greases his pure mind , that from it all consideration slips !
enter apemantus more man ?
plague , plague !
i was directed hither men report thou dost affect my manners , and dost use them .
is , then , because thou dost not keep a dog , whom i would imitate consumption catch thee !
this is in thee a nature but infected , a poor unmanly melancholy sprung from change of fortune .
why this spade ?
this place ?
this habit ?
and these looks of care ?
thy flatterers yet wear silk , drink wine , lie soft , hug their diseased perfumes , and have forgot that ever timon was .
shame not these woods , by putting on the cunning of a carper .
be thou a flatterer now , and seek to thrive by that which has undone thee hinge thy knee , and let his very breath , whom observe , blow off thy cap , praise his most vicious strain , and call it excellent thou wast told thus , thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome to knaves and all approachers is most just that thou turn rascal , hadst thou wealth again , rascals should have .
do not assume my likeness .
were i like thee , throw away myself .
thou hast cast away thyself , being like thyself , a madman so long , now a fool .
what , that the bleak air , thy boisterous chamberlain , will put thy shirt on warm ?
will these moss trees , that have outlived the eagle , page thy heels , and skip where thou out ?
will the cold brook , candied with ice , caudle thy morning taste , to cure thy surfeit ?
call the creatures whose naked natures live in an the spite of wreakful heaven , whose bare unhoused trunks , to the conflicting elements exposed , answer mere nature , bid them flatter thee , o , thou shalt find a fool of thee depart .
i love thee better now than i did .
i hate thee worse .
why ?
thou misery .
i flatter not , but say thou art a caitiff .
why dost thou seek me out ?
to vex thee .
always a villain office or a fool .
dost please thyself i ?
ay .
what !
a knave too ?
if thou didst put this habit on to castigate thy pride , well but thou dost it enforcedly , courtier be again , wert thou not beggar .
willing misery outlives encertain pomp , is crown before the one is filling still , never complete , the other , at high wish best state , contentless , hath a distracted and most wretched being , worse than the worst , content .
thou shouldst desire to die , being miserable .
not by his breath that is more miserable .
thou art a slave , whom fortune tender arm with favour never clasp , but bred a dog .
hadst thou , like us from our first swath , proceeded the sweet degrees that this brief world affords to such as may the passive drugs of it freely command , thou wouldst have plunged thyself in general riot , melted down thy youth in different beds of lust , and never learn the icy precepts of respect , but follow the sugar game before thee .
but myself , who had the world as my confectionary , the mouths , the tongues , the eyes and hearts of men at duty , more than i could frame employment , that numberless upon me stuck as leaves do on the oak , hive with one winter brush fell from their boughs and left me open , bare for every storm that blows i , to bear this , that never knew but better , is some burden thy nature did commence in sufferance , time hath made thee hard i .
why shouldst thou hate men ?
they never flatter thee what hast thou given ?
if thou wilt curse , thy father , that poor rag , must be thy subject , who in spite put stuff to some she beggar and compounded thee poor rogue hereditary .
hence , be gone !
if thou hadst not been born the worst of men , thou hadst been a knave and flatterer .
art thou proud yet ?
ay , that i am not thee .
i , that i was no prodigal .
i , that i am one now were all the wealth i have shut up in thee , give thee leave to hang it .
get thee gone .
that the whole life of athens were in this !
thus would i eat it .
eating a root here , i will mend thy feast .
offering him a root first mend my company , take away thyself .
so i shall mend mine own , by the lack of thine .
is not well mended so , it is but botch , if not , i would it were .
what wouldst thou have to athens ?
thee thither in a whirlwind .
if thou wilt , tell them there i have gold , look , so i have .
here is no use for gold .
the best and truest , for here it sleeps , and does no hired harm .
where liest o ' nights , timon ?
under that above me .
where thou o ' days , apemantus ?
where my stomach finds meat , or , rather , where i eat it .
would poison were obedient and knew my mind !
where wouldst thou send it ?
to sauce thy dishes .
the middle of humanity thou never knewest , but the extremity of both ends when thou wast in thy gilt and thy perfume , they mocked thee for too much curiosity , in thy rags thou knowest none , but art despised for the contrary .
there a medlar for thee , eat it .
on what i hate i feed not .
dost hate a medlar ?
ay , though it look like thee .
an thou hadst hated meddlers sooner , thou shouldst have loved thyself better now .
what man didst thou ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means ?
who , without those means thou talkest of , didst thou ever know beloved ?
myself .
i understand thee , thou hadst some means to keep a dog .
what things in the world canst thou nearest compare to thy flatterers ?
women nearest , but men , men are the things themselves .
what wouldst thou do with the world , apemantus , if it lay in thy power ?
give it the beasts , to be rid of the men .
wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of men , and remain a beast with the beasts ?
ay , timon .
a beastly ambition , which the gods grant thee t ' attain to !
if thou wert the lion , the fox would beguile thee , if thou wert the lamb , the fox would eat three if thou wert the fox , the lion would suspect thee , when peradventure thou wert accused by the ass if thou wert the ass , thy dulness would torment thee , and still thou livedst but as a breakfast to the wolf if thou wert the wolf , thy greediness would afflict thee , and oft thou shouldst hazard thy life for thy dinner wert thou the unicorn , pride and wrath would confound thee and make thine own self the conquest of thy fury wert thou a bear , thou wouldst be killed by the horse wert thou a horse , thou wouldst be seized by the leopard wert thou a leopard , thou wert german to the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on thy life all thy safety were remotion and thy defence absence .
what beast couldst thou be , that were not subject to a beast ?
and what a beast art thou already , that seest not thy loss in transformation !
if thou couldst please me with speaking to me , thou mightst have hit upon it here the commonwealth of athens is become a forest of beasts .
how has the ass broke the wall , that thou art out of the city ?
yonder comes a poet and a painter the plague of company light upon thee !
i will fear to catch it and give way when i know not what else to do , i see thee again .
when there is nothing living but thee , thou shalt be welcome .
i had rather be a beggar dog than apemantus .
thou art the cap of all the fools alive .
would thou wert clean enough to spit upon !
a plague on thee !
thou art too bad to curse .
all villains that do stand by thee are pure .
there is no leprosy but what thou .
if i name thee .
i beat thee , but i should infect my hands .
i would my tongue could rot them off !
away , thou issue of a mangy dog !
choler does kill me that thou art alive , i swound to see thee .
would thou wouldst burst !
away , thou tedious rogue !
i am sorry i shall lose a stone by thee .
throws a stone at him beast !
slave !
toad !
rogue , rogue , rogue !
i am sick of this false world , and will love nought but even the mere necessities upon .
then , timon , presently prepare thy grave , lie where the light foam the sea may beat thy daily make thine epitaph , that death in me at others ' lives may laugh .
to the gold o thou sweet , and dear divorce natural son and sire !
thou bright defiler of hymen purest bed !
thou valiant mars !
thou ever young , fresh , loved and delicate wooer , whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow that lies on dian lap !
thou visible god , that close impossibilities , and makest them kiss !
that with every tongue , to every purpose !
o thou touch of hearts !
think , thy slave man rebels , and by thy virtue set them into confounding odds , that beasts may have the world in empire !
would so !
but not till i am dead .
i say gold thou wilt be throng to shortly .
throng to !
ay .
thy back , i prithee .
live , and love thy misery .
long live so , and so die .
exit apemantus i am quit .
moe things like men !
eat , timon , and abhor them .
enter banditti where should he have this gold ?
it is some poor fragment , some slender sort of his remainder the mere want of gold , and the of his friends , drove him into this melancholy .
it is noised he hath a mass of treasure .
let us make the assay upon him if he care not , he will supply us easily , if he covetously reserve it , how shall get it ?
true , for he bears it not about him , is hid .
is not this he ?
where ?
is his description .
he , i know him .
save thee , timon .
now , thieves ?
soldiers , not thieves .
both too , and women sons .
we are not thieves , but men that much do want .
your greatest want is , you want much of meat .
why should you want ?
behold , the earth hath roots , within this mile break forth a hundred springs , the oaks bear mast , the briers scarlet hips , the bounteous housewife , nature , on each bush lays her full mess before you .
want !
why want ?
we can not live on grass , on berries , water , as beasts and birds and fishes .
nor on the beasts themselves , the birds , and fishes , you must eat men .
yet thanks i must you con that you are thieves profess , that you work not in holier shapes for there is boundless theft in limited professions .
rascal thieves , here gold .
go , suck the subtle blood o ' the grape , till the high fever seethe your blood to froth , and so hanging trust not the physician , his antidotes are poison , and he slays moe than you rob take wealth and lives together , do villany , do , since you protest to , like workmen .
i example you with thievery .
the sun a thief , and with his great attraction robs the vast sea the moon an arrant thief , and her pale fire she snatches from the sun the sea a thief , whose liquid surge resolves the moon into salt tears the earth a thief , that feeds and breeds by a composture stolen from general excrement each thing a thief the laws , your curb and whip , in their rough power have uncheque theft .
love not yourselves away , rob one another .
there more gold .
cut throats all that you meet are thieves to athens go , break open shops , nothing can you steal , but thieves do lose it steal no less for this i give you , and gold confound you !
amen .
has almost charmed me from my profession , by persuading me to it .
is in the malice of mankind that he thus advises us , not to have us thrive in our mystery .
i believe him as an enemy , and give over my trade .
let us first see peace in athens there is no time so miserable but a man may be true .
exeunt banditti enter flavius o you gods !
is yond despised and ruinous man my lord ?
full of decay and failing ?
o monument and wonder of good deeds evilly bestow !
what an alteration of honour has desperate want made !
what viler thing upon the earth than friends who can bring noblest minds to basest ends !
how rarely does it meet with this time guise , when man was wish to love his enemies !
grant i may ever love , and rather woo those that would mischief me than those that do !
has caught me in his eye i will present my honest grief unto him , and , as my lord , still serve him with my life .
my dearest master !
away !
what art thou ?
have you forgot me , sir ?
why dost ask that ?
i have forgot all men , then , if thou a man , i have forgot thee .
an honest poor servant of yours .
then i know thee not i never had honest man about me , i , all i kept were knaves , to serve in meat to villains .
the gods are witness , did poor steward wear a truer grief for his undone lord than mine eyes for you .
what , dost thou weep ?
come nearer .
then i love thee , because thou art a woman , and flinty mankind , whose eyes do never give but thorough lust and laughter .
pity sleeping strange times , that weep with laughing , not with weeping !
i beg of you to know me , good my lord , to accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts to entertain me as your steward still .
had i a steward so true , so just , and now so comfortable ?
it almost turns my dangerous nature mild .
let me behold thy face .
surely , this man was born of woman .
forgive my general and exceptless rashness , you gods !
i do proclaim one honest man mistake me not but one , no more , i pray , and he a steward .
how fain would i have hated all mankind !
and thou thyself but all , save thee , i fell with curses .
methinks thou art more honest now than wise , for , by oppressing and betraying me , thou mightst have sooner got another service for many so arrive at second masters , upon their first lord neck .
but tell me true for i must ever doubt , though so sure is not thy kindness subtle , covetous , if not a usuring kindness , and , as rich men deal gifts , expecting in return twenty for one ?
no , my most worthy master , in whose breast doubt and suspect , alas , are placed too late you should have fear false times when you did feast suspect still comes where an estate is least .
that which i show , heaven knows , is merely love , duty and zeal to your unmatched mind , care of your food and living , and , believe it , my most honour lord , for any benefit that points to me , either in hope or present , exchange for this one wish , that you had power and wealth to requite me , by making rich yourself .
look thee , is so !
thou singly honest man , here , take the gods out of my misery have sent thee treasure .
go , live rich and happy , but thus condition thou shalt build from men , hate all , curse all , show charity to none , but let the famish flesh slide from the bone , ere thou relieve the beggar , give to dogs what thou to men , let prisons swallow , debts wither to nothing , be men like blasted woods , and may diseases lick up their false bloods !
and so farewell and thrive .
o , let me stay , and comfort you , my master .
if thou hatest curses , stay not , fly , whilst thou art blest and free see thou man , and let me see thee .
exit flavius .
timon retires to his cave act v scene i .
the woods .
before timon cave .
enter poet and painter , timon watching them from his cave as i took note of the place , it can not be far where he abides .
what to be thought of him ?
does the rumour hold for true , that he so full of gold ?
certain alcibiades reports it , phrynia and timandra had gold of him he likewise enriched poor straggling soldiers with great quantity is said he gave unto his steward a mighty sum .
then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends .
nothing else you shall see him a palm in athens again , and flourish with the highest .
therefore is not amiss we tender our loves to him , in this supposed distress of his it will show honestly in us , and is very likely to load our purposes with what they travail for , if it be a just true report that goes of his having .
what have you now to present unto him ?
nothing at this time but my visitation only i will promise him an excellent piece .
i must serve him so too , tell him of an intent that coming toward him .
good as the best .
promising is the very air o ' the time it opens the eyes of expectation performance is ever the duller for his act , and , but in the plainer and simpler kind of people , the deed of saying is quite out of use .
to promise is most courtly and fashionable performance is a kind of will or testament which argues a great sickness in his judgment that makes it .
timon comes from his cave , behind aside excellent workman !
thou canst not paint a man so bad as is thyself .
i am thinking what i shall say i have provided for him it must be a personating of himself , a satire against the softness of prosperity , with a discovery of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency .
aside must thou needs stand for a villain in thine own work ?
wilt thou whip thine own faults in other men ?
do so , i have gold for thee .
nay , let seek him then do we sin against our own estate , when we may profit meet , and come too late .
true , when the day serves , before night , find what thou by free and offer light .
come .
aside i meet you at the turn .
what a god gold , that he is worshipp in a baser temple than where swine feed !
is thou that the bark and the foam , settlest admired reverence in a slave to thee be worship !
and thy saints for aye be crown with plagues that thee alone obey !
fit i meet them .
coming forward hail , worthy timon !
our late noble master !
have i once lived to see two honest men ?
sir , having often of your open bounty tasted , hearing you were retired , your friends off , whose thankless natures o abhorred spirits ! not all the whips of heaven are large enough what !
to you , whose nobleness gave life and influence to their whole being !
i am rapt and can not cover the monstrous bulk of this ingratitude with any size of words .
let it go naked , men may the better you that are honest , by being what you are , make them best seen and known .
he and myself have travail in the great shower of your gifts , and sweetly felt it .
ay , you are honest men .
we are hither come to offer you our service .
most honest men !
why , how shall i requite you ?
can you eat roots , and drink cold water ?
no .
what we can do , we do , to do you service .
ye honest men ye heard that i have gold , i am sure you have speak truth , ye honest men .
so it is said , my noble lord , but therefore came not my friend nor i .
good honest men !
thou a counterfeit best in all athens , indeed , the best , thou most lively .
so , so , my lord .
so , sir , as i say .
and , for thy fiction , why , thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth that thou art even natural in thine art .
but , for all this , my friends , i must needs say you have a little fault marry , is not monstrous in you , neither wish i you take much pains to mend .
beseech your honour to make it known to us .
you take it most thankfully , my lord .
will you , indeed ?
doubt it not , worthy lord .
there never a one of you but trusts a knave , that mightily deceives you .
do we , my lord ?
ay , and you hear him cog , see him dissemble , know his gross patchery , love him , feed him , keep in your bosom yet remain assured that he a villain .
i know none such , my lord .
nor i .
look you , i love you well , i give you gold , rid me these villains from your companies hang them or stab them , drown them in a draught , confound them by some course , and come to me , i give you gold enough .
name them , my lord , let know them .
you that way and you this , but two in company , each man apart , all single and alone , yet an keeps him company .
if where thou art two villains shall not be , come not near him .
if thou wouldst not reside but where one villain is , then him abandon .
hence , pack !
there gold , you came for gold , ye slaves to painter you have work for me , there payment for you hence !
to poet you are an alchemist , make gold of that .
out , rascal dogs !
beats them out , and then retires to his cave enter flavius and two senators it is in vain that you would speak with timon , for he is set so only to himself that nothing but himself which looks like man is friendly with him .
bring us to his cave it is our part and promise to the athenians to speak with timon .
at all times alike men are not still the same was time and griefs that framed him thus time , with his fairer hand , offering the fortunes of his former days , the former man may make him .
bring us to him , and chance it as it may .
here is his cave .
peace and content be here !
lord timon !
timon !
look out , and speak to friends the athenians , by two of their most reverend senate , greet thee speak to them , noble timon .
timon comes from his cave thou sun , that , burn !
speak , and be hang for each true word , a blister !
and each false be as cauterizing to the root o ' the tongue , consuming it with speaking !
worthy timon , of none but such as you , and you of timon .
the senators of athens greet thee , timon .
i thank them , and would send them back the plague , could i but catch it for them .
o , forget what we are sorry for ourselves in thee .
the senators with one consent of love entreat thee back to athens , who have thought on special dignities , which vacant lie for thy best use and wearing .
they confess toward thee forgetfulness too general , gross which now the public body , which doth seldom play the recanter , feeling in itself a lack of timon aid , hath sense withal of its own fail , restraining aid to timon , and send forth us , to make their sorrow render , together with a recompense more fruitful than their offence can weigh down by the dram , ay , even such heaps and sums of love and wealth as shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs and write in thee the figures of their love , ever to read them thine .
you witch me in it , surprise me to the very brink of tears lend me a fool heart and a woman eyes , and i beweep these comforts , worthy senators .
therefore , so please thee to return with us and of our athens , thine and ours , to take the captainship , thou shalt be met with thanks , allow with absolute power and thy good name live with authority so soon we shall drive back of alcibiades the approaches wild , who , like a boar too savage , doth root up his country peace .
and shakes his threatening sword against the walls of athens .
therefore , timon , well , sir , i will , therefore , i will , sir , thus if alcibiades kill my countrymen , let alcibiades know this of timon , that timon cares not .
but if be sack fair athens , and take our goodly aged men by the beards , giving our holy virgins to the stain of contumelious , beastly , war , then let him know , and tell him timon speaks it , in pity of our aged and our youth , i can not choose but tell him , that i care not , and let him at worst , for their knives care not , while you have throats to answer for myself , there not a whittle in the unruly camp but i do prize it at my love before the throat in athens .
so i leave you to the protection of the prosperous gods , as thieves to keepers .
stay not , all in vain .
why , i was writing of my epitaph , it will be seen my long sickness of health and living now begins to mend , and nothing brings me all things .
go , live still , be alcibiades your plague , you his , and last so long enough !
we speak in vain .
but yet i love my country , and am not one that rejoices in the common wreck , as common bruit doth put it .
that well spoke .
commend me to my loving countrymen , these words become your lips as they pass thorough them .
and enter in our ears like great triumphers in their applauding gates .
commend me to them , and tell them that , to ease them of their griefs , their fears of hostile strokes , their aches , losses , their pangs of love , with other incident throes that nature fragile vessel doth sustain in life uncertain voyage , i will some kindness do them i teach them to prevent wild alcibiades ' wrath .
i like this well , he will return again .
i have a tree , which grows here in my close , that mine own use invites me to cut down , and shortly must i fell it tell my friends , tell athens , in the sequence of degree from high to low throughout , that whoso please to stop affliction , let him take his haste , come hither , ere my tree hath felt the axe , and hang himself .
i pray you , do my greeting .
trouble him no further , thus you still shall find him .
come not to me again but say to athens , timon hath made his everlasting mansion upon the beached verge of the salt flood , who once a day with his embossed froth the turbulent surge shall cover thither come , and let my be your oracle .
lips , let sour words go by and language end what is amiss plague and infection mend !
graves only be men works and death their gain !
sun , hide thy beams !
timon hath done his reign .
retires to his cave his discontents are unremoveably coupled to nature .
our hope in him is dead let us return , and strain what other means is left unto us in our dear peril .
it requires swift foot .
exeunt scene ii .
before the walls of athens .
enter two senators and a messenger thou hast painfully discover are his files as full as thy report ?
have spoke the least besides , his expedition promises present approach .
we stand much hazard , if they bring not timon .
i met a courier , one mine ancient friend , whom , though in general part we were opposed , yet our old love made a particular force , and made us speak like friends this man was riding from alcibiades to timon cave , with letters of entreaty , which imported his fellowship i ' the cause against your city , in part for his sake moved .
here come our brothers .
enter the senators from timon no talk of timon , nothing of him expect .
the enemies ' drum is heard , and fearful scouring doth choke the air with dust in , and prepare ours is the fall , i fear , our foes the snare .
exeunt scene iii .
the woods .
timon cave , and a rude tomb seen .
enter a soldier , seeking timon by all description this should be the place .
who here ?
speak , ho !
no answer !
what is this ?
timon is dead , who hath outstretch his span some beast rear this , there does not live a man .
dead , sure , and this his grave .
what on this tomb i can not read , the character i take with wax our captain hath in every figure skill , an aged interpreter , though young in days before proud athens he set down by this , whose fall the mark of his ambition is .
exit scene iv .
before the walls of athens .
trumpets sound .
enter alcibiades with his powers sound to this coward and lascivious town our terrible approach .
a parley sounded enter senators on the walls till now you have gone on and fill the time with all licentious measure , making your wills the scope of justice , till now myself and such as slept within the shadow of your power hav e wander with our traversed arms and breathed our sufferance vainly now the time is flush , when crouching marrow in the bearer strong cries of itself more ' now breathless wrong shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease , and pursy insolence shall break his wind with fear and horrid flight .
noble and young , when thy first griefs were but a mere conceit , ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear , we sent to thee , to give thy rages balm , to wipe out our ingratitude with loves above their quantity .
so did we woo transformed timon to our city love by humble message and by promised means we were not all unkind , nor all deserve the common stroke of war .
these walls of ours were not erected by their hands from whom you have received your griefs , nor are they such that these great towers , trophies and schools should fall for private faults in them .
nor are they living who were the motives that you first went out , shame that they wanted cunning , in excess hath broke their hearts .
march , noble lord , into our city with thy banners spread by decimation , and a tithed death if thy revenges hunger for that food which nature loathes take thou the destined tenth , and by the hazard of the spotted die let die the spotted .
all have not offended , for those that were , it is not square to take on those that are , revenges crimes , like lands , are not inherited .
then , dear countryman , bring in thy ranks , but leave without thy rage spare thy athenian cradle and those kin which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall with those that have offended like a shepherd , approach the fold and cull the infected forth , but kill not all together .
what thou wilt , thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile than hew with thy sword .
set but thy foot against our rampired gates , and they shall ope , so thou wilt send thy gentle heart before , to say enter friendly .
throw thy glove , or any token of thine honour else , that thou wilt use the wars as thy redress and not as our confusion , all thy powers shall make their harbour in our town , till we have seal thy full desire .
then there my glove , descend , and open your uncharged ports those enemies of timon and mine own whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof fall and no more and , to atone your fears with my more noble meaning , not a man shall pass his quarter , or offend the stream of regular justice in your city bounds , but shall be render to your public laws at heaviest answer .
is most nobly spoken .
descend , and keep your words .
the senators descend , and open the gates enter soldier my noble general , timon is dead , entomb upon the very hem o ' the sea , and on his this insculpture , which with wax i brought away , whose soft impression interprets for my poor ignorance .
reads the epitaph lies a wretched corse , of wretched soul bereft seek not my name a plague consume you wicked caitiffs left !
here lie i , timon , who , alive , all living men did hate pass by and curse thy fill , but pass and stay not here thy gait . '
these well express in thee thy latter spirits though thou in us our human griefs , our brain flow and those our droplets which from niggard nature fall , yet rich conceit taught thee to make vast neptune weep for aye on thy low grave , on faults forgiven .
dead is noble timon of whose memory hereafter more .
bring me into your city , and i will use the olive with my sword , make war breed peace , make peace stint war , make each prescribe to other as each other leech .
let our drums strike .

romans , friends , followers , favorers of my right , if ever bassianus , caesar son , were gracious in the eyes of royal rome , keep then this passage to the capitol and suffer not dishonour to approach the imperial seat , to virtue consecrate , to justice , continence and nobility , but let desert in pure election shine , and , romans , fight for freedom in your choice .
enter marcus andronicus , aloft , with the crown princes , that strive by factions and by friends ambitiously for rule and empery , know that the people of rome , for whom we stand a special party , have , by common voice , in election for the roman empery , chosen andronicus , surnamed pius for many good and great deserts to rome a nobler man , a braver warrior , lives not this day within the city walls he by the senate is accit home from weary wars against the barbarous goths , that , with his sons , a terror to our foes , hath yoked a nation strong , train up in arms .
ten years are spent since first he undertook this cause of rome and chastised with arms our enemies ' pride five times he hath return bleeding to rome , bearing his valiant sons in coffins from the field , and now at last , laden with horror spoils , returns the good andronicus to rome , renowned titus , flourishing in arms .
let us entreat , by honour of his name , whom worthily you would have now succeed .
and in the capitol and senate right , whom you pretend to honour and adore , that you withdraw you and abate your strength , dismiss your followers and , as suitors should , plead your deserts in peace and humbleness .
how fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts !
marcus andronicus , so i do ally in thy uprightness and integrity , and so i love and honour thee and thine , thy noble brother titus and his sons , and her to whom my thoughts are humbled all , gracious lavinia , rome rich ornament , that i will here dismiss my loving friends , and to my fortunes and the people favor commit my cause in balance to be weigh .
exeunt the followers of bassianus friends , that have been thus forward in my right , i thank you all and here dismiss you all , and to the love and favor of my country commit myself , my person and the cause .
exeunt the followers of saturninus rome , be as just and gracious unto me as i am confident and kind to thee .
open the gates , and let me in .
tribunes , and me , a poor competitor .

saturninus and bassianus go up into the capitol enter a captain romans , make way the good andronicus .
patron of virtue , rome best champion , successful in the battles that he fights , with honour and with fortune is return from where he circumscribed with his sword , and brought to yoke , the enemies of rome .
drums and trumpets sounded .

after them , titus andronicus , and then tamora , with alarbus , demetrius , chiron , aaron , and other goths , prisoners , soldiers and people following .
the bearers set down the coffin , and titus speaks hail , rome , victorious in thy mourning weeds !
lo , as the bark , that hath discharged her fraught , returns with precious jading to the bay from whence at first she weigh her anchorage , cometh andronicus , bound with laurel boughs , to his country with his tears , tears of true joy for his return to rome .
thou great defender of this capitol , stand gracious to the rites that we intend !
romans , of five and twenty valiant sons , half of the number that king priam had , behold the poor remains , alive and dead !
these that survive let rome reward with love , these that i bring unto their latest home , with burial amongst their ancestors here goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword .
titus , unkind and careless of thine own , why thou thy sons , unburied yet , to hover on the dreadful shore of styx ?
make way to lay them by their brethren .
the tomb is opened there greet in silence , as the dead are wont , and sleep in peace , slain in your country wars !
o sacred receptacle of my joys , sweet cell of virtue and nobility , how many sons of mine hast thou in store , that thou wilt never render to me more !
give us the proudest prisoner of the goths , that we may hew his limbs , and on a pile ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh , before this earthy prison of their bones , that so the shadows be not unappeased , nor we disturb with prodigies on earth .
i give him you , the noblest that survives , the eldest son of this distressed queen .
stay , roman brethren !
gracious conqueror , victorious titus , rue the tears i shed , a mother tears in passion for her son and if thy sons were ever dear to thee , o , think my son to be as dear to me !
sufficeth not that we are brought to rome , to beautify thy triumphs and return , captive to thee and to thy roman yoke , but must my sons be slaughter in the streets , for valiant doings in their country cause ?
o , if to fight for king and commonweal were piety in thine , it is in these .
andronicus , stain not thy tomb with blood wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods ?
draw near them then in being merciful sweet mercy is nobility true badge thrice noble titus , spare my son .
patient yourself , madam , and pardon me .
these are their brethren , whom you goths beheld alive and dead , and for their brethren slain religiously they ask a sacrifice to this your son is mark , and die he must , to appease their groaning shadows that are gone .
away with him !
and make a fire straight , and with our swords , upon a pile of wood , let hew his limbs till they be clean consumed .
exeunt lucius , quintus , martius , and mutius , with alarbus o cruel , irreligious piety !
was ever scythia half so barbarous ?
oppose not scythia to ambitious rome .
alarbus goes to rest , and we survive to tremble under titus ' threatening looks .
then , madam , stand resolved , but hope withal the gods that arm the queen of troy with opportunity of sharp revenge upon the thracian tyrant in his tent , may favor tamora , the queen of goths when goths were goths and tamora was queen to quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes .
lucius , quintus , martius and mutius , with their swords bloody see , lord and father , how we have perform our roman rites alarbus ' limbs are lopp , and entrails feed the sacrificing fire , whose smoke , like incense , doth perfume the sky .
remaineth nought , but to inter our brethren , and with loud welcome them to rome .
let it be so , and let andronicus make this his latest farewell to their souls .
trumpets sounded , and the coffin laid in the tomb in peace and honour rest you here , my sons , rome readiest champions , repose you here in rest , secure from worldly chances and mishaps !
here lurks no treason , here no envy swells , here grow no damned grudges , here are no storms , no noise , but silence and eternal sleep in peace and honour rest you here , my sons !
enter lavinia in peace and honour live lord titus long , my noble lord and father , live in fame !
lo , at this tomb my tributary tears i render , for my brethren obsequies , and at thy feet i kneel , with tears of joy , shed on the earth , for thy return to rome o , bless me here with thy victorious hand , whose fortunes rome best citizens applaud !

a better head her glorious body fits than his that shakes for age and feebleness what should i don this robe , and trouble you ?
be chosen with proclamations , yield up rule , resign my life , and set abroad new business for you all ?
rome , i have been thy soldier forty years , and led my country strength successfully , and buried one and twenty valiant sons , knighted in field , slain manfully in arms , in right and service of their noble country give me a staff of honour for mine age , but not a sceptre to control the world upright he held it , lords , that held it last .
titus , thou shalt obtain and ask the empery .
proud and ambitious tribune , canst thou tell ?
patience , prince saturninus .
romans , do me right patricians , draw your swords and sheathe them not till saturninus be rome emperor .
andronicus , would thou wert shipp to hell , rather than rob me of the people hearts !
proud saturnine , interrupter of the good that titus means to thee !
content thee , prince , i will restore to thee the people hearts , and wean them from themselves .
andronicus , i do not flatter thee , but honour thee , and will do till i die my faction if thou strengthen with thy friends , i will most thankful be , and thanks to men of noble minds is honourable meed .
people of rome , and people tribunes here , i ask your voices and your suffrages will you bestow them friendly on andronicus ?
to gratify the good andronicus , and gratulate his safe return to rome , the people will accept whom he admits .
tribunes , i thank you and this suit i make , that you create your emperor eldest son , lord saturnine , whose virtues will , i hope , reflect on rome as titan rays on earth , and ripen justice in this commonweal then , if you will elect by my advice , crown him and say live our emperor ! '
with voices and applause of every sort , patricians and plebeians , we create lord saturninus rome great emperor , and say live our emperor saturnine ! '
a long flourish till they come down titus andronicus , for thy favors done to us in our election this day , i give thee thanks in part of thy deserts , and will with deeds requite thy gentleness and , for an onset , titus , to advance thy name and honourable family , lavinia will i make my empress , rome royal mistress , mistress of my heart , and in the sacred pantheon her espouse tell me , andronicus , doth this motion please thee ?
it doth , my worthy lord , and in this match i hold me highly honour of your grace and here in sight of rome to saturnine , king and commander of our commonweal , the wide world emperor , do i consecrate my sword , my chariot and my prisoners , presents well worthy rome imperial lord receive them then , the tribute that i owe , mine honour ensigns humbled at thy feet .
thanks , noble titus , father of my life !
how proud i am of thee and of thy gifts rome shall record , and when i do forget the least of these unspeakable deserts , romans , forget your fealty to me .
to tamora now , madam , are you prisoner to an emperor , to him that , for your honour and your state , will use you nobly and your followers .
a goodly lady , trust me , of the hue that i would choose , were i to choose anew .
clear up , fair queen , that cloudy countenance though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer , thou comest not to be made a scorn in rome princely shall be thy usage every way .
rest on my word , and let not discontent daunt all your hopes madam , he comforts you can make you greater than the queen of goths .
lavinia , you are not displeased with this ?

thanks , sweet lavinia .
romans , let us go , ransomless here we set our prisoners free proclaim our honours , lords , with trump and drum .

are you in earnest then , my lord ?
ay , noble titus , and resolved withal to do myself this reason and this right .
cuique ' is our roman justice this prince in justice seizeth but his own .
and that he will , and shall , if lucius live .
traitors , avaunt !
where is the emperor guard ?
treason , my lord !
lavinia is surprised !

by whom ?
by him that justly may bear his betroth from all the world away .
exeunt bassianus and marcus with lavinia brothers , help to convey her hence away , and with my sword i keep this door safe .
exeunt lucius , quintus , and martius follow , my lord , and i soon bring her back .
my lord , you pass not here .

stabbing mutius help , lucius , help !
dies during the fray , saturninus , tamora , demetrius , chiron and aaron go out and , above lucius my lord , you are unjust , and , more than so , in wrongful quarrel you have slain your son .
nor thou , nor he , are any sons of mine , my sons would never so dishonour me traitor , restore lavinia to the emperor .
dead , if you will , but not to be his wife , that is another lawful promised love .
exit no , titus , no , the emperor needs her not , nor her , nor thee , nor any of thy stock i trust , by leisure , him that mocks me once , thee never , nor thy traitorous haughty sons , confederates all thus to dishonour me .
was there none else in rome to make a stale , but saturnine ?
full well , andronicus , agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine , that i begg the empire at thy hands .
o monstrous !
what reproachful words are these ?
but go thy ways , go , give that changing piece to him that flourish for her with his sword a valiant thou shalt enjoy , one fit to bandy with thy lawless sons , to ruffle in the commonwealth of rome .
these words are razors to my wounded heart .
and therefore , lovely tamora , queen of goths , that like the stately phoebe her nymphs dost overshine the dames of rome , if thou be pleased with this my sudden choice , behold , i choose thee , tamora , for my bride , and will create thee empress of rome , speak , queen of goths , dost thou applaud my choice ?
and here i swear by all the roman gods , sith priest and holy water are so near and tapers burn so bright and every thing in readiness for hymenaeus stand , i will not the streets of rome , or climb my palace , till from forth this place i lead espoused my bride along with me .
and here , in sight of heaven , to rome i swear , if saturnine advance the queen of goths , she will a handmaid be to his desires , a loving nurse , a mother to his youth .
ascend , fair queen , pantheon .
lords , accompany your noble emperor and his lovely bride , sent by the heavens for prince saturnine , whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered there shall we consummate our spousal rites .
exeunt all but titus i am not bid to wait upon this bride .
titus , when wert thou wont to walk alone , dishonour thus , and challenged of wrongs ?
marcus , lucius , quintus , and martius o titus , see , o , see what thou hast done !
in a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son .
no , foolish tribune , no , no son of mine , nor thou , nor these , confederates in the deed that hath dishonour all our family , unworthy brother , and unworthy sons !
but let us give him burial , as becomes , give mutius burial with our brethren .
traitors , away !
he rests not in this tomb this monument five hundred years hath stood , which i have sumptuously here none but soldiers and rome servitors repose in fame , none basely slain in brawls bury him where you can , he comes not here .
my lord , this is impiety in you my nephew mutius ' deeds do plead for him he must be buried with his brethren .
and shall , or him we will accompany .
shall ! '
what villain was it that spake that word ?
he that would vouch it in any place but here .
what , would you bury him in my despite ?
no , noble titus , but entreat of thee to pardon mutius and to bury him .
marcus , even thou hast struck upon my crest , and , with these boys , mine honour thou hast wounded my foes i do repute you every one , so , trouble me no more , but get you gone .
he is not with himself , let us withdraw .
not i , till mutius ' bones be buried .
marcus and the sons of titus kneel brother , for in that name doth nature plead , father , and in that name doth nature speak , speak thou no more , if all the rest will speed .
renowned titus , more than half my soul , dear father , soul and substance of us all , suffer thy brother marcus to inter his noble nephew here in virtue nest , that died in honour and lavinia cause .
thou art a roman , be not barbarous the greeks upon advice did bury ajax that slew himself , and wise laertes ' son did graciously plead for his funerals let not young mutius , then , that was thy joy be barr his entrance here .
rise , marcus , rise .
the day is this that i saw , to be dishonour by my sons in rome !
well , bury him , and bury me the next .
mutius is put into the tomb there lie thy bones , sweet mutius , with thy friends , till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb .
kneeling no man shed tears for noble mutius , he lives in fame that died in virtue cause .
my lord , to step out of these dreary dumps , how comes it that the subtle queen of goths is of a sudden thus advanced in rome ?
i know not , marcus , but i know it is , whether by device or no , the heavens can tell is she not then beholding to the man that brought her for this high good turn so far ?
yes , and will nobly him remunerate .

but let the laws of rome determine all , meanwhile i am possess of that is mine .
is good , sir you are very short with us , but , if we live , we be as sharp with you .
my lord , what i have done , as best i may , answer i must and shall do with my life .
only thus much i give your grace to know by all the duties that i owe to rome , this noble gentleman , lord titus here , is in opinion and in honour wrong , that in the rescue of lavinia with his own hand did slay his youngest son , in zeal to you and highly moved to wrath to be controll in that he frankly gave receive him , then , to favor , saturnine , that hath express himself in all his deeds a father and a friend to thee and rome .
prince bassianus , leave to plead my deeds is thou and those that have dishonour me .
rome and the righteous heavens be my judge , how i have loved and honour saturnine !
my worthy lord , if ever tamora were gracious in those princely eyes of thine , then hear me speak in indifferently for all , and at my suit , sweet , pardon what is past .
what , madam !
be dishonour openly , and basely put it up without revenge ?
not so , my lord , the gods of rome forfend i should be author to dishonour you !
but on mine honour dare i undertake for good lord titus ' innocence in all , whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs then , at my suit , look graciously on him , lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose , nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart .
aside to saturninus be won at last , dissemble all your griefs and discontents you are but newly planted in your throne , lest , then , the people , and patricians too , upon a just survey , take titus ' part , and so supplant you for ingratitude , which rome reputes to be a heinous sin , yield at entreats , and then let me alone i find a day to massacre them all and raze their faction and their family , the cruel father and his traitorous sons , to whom i sued for my dear son life , and make them know what is to let a queen kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain .
aloud come , come , sweet emperor , come , andronicus , take up this good old man , and cheer the heart that dies in tempest of thy angry frown .
rise , titus , rise , my empress hath prevail .
i thank your majesty , and her , my lord these words , these looks , infuse new life in me .

and fear not lords , and you , lavinia , by my advice , all humbled on your knees , you shall ask pardon of his majesty .
we do , and vow to heaven and to his highness , that what we did was mildly as we might , tendering our sister honour and our own .

exeunt act ii scene rome .
before the palace .
enter aaron now climbeth tamora olympus ' top , safe out of fortune shot , and sits aloft , secure of thunder crack or lightning flash , advanced above pale envy threatening reach .
as when the golden sun salutes the morn , and , having gilt the ocean with his beams , gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach , and overlooks the hills , so tamora upon her wit doth earthly honour wait , and virtue stoops and trembles at her frown .
then , aaron , arm thy heart , and fit thy thoughts , to mount aloft with thy imperial mistress , and mount her pitch , whom thou in triumph long hast prisoner held , fetter in amorous chains and faster bound to aaron charming eyes than is prometheus tied to caucasus .
away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts !
i will be bright , and shine in pearl and gold , to wait upon this empress .
to wait , said i ?
to wanton with this queen , this goddess , this semiramis , this nymph , this siren , that will charm rome saturnine , and see his shipwreck and his commonweal .
holloa !
what storm is this ?
enter demetrius and chiron , braving chiron , thy years want wit , thy wit wants edge , and manners , to intrude where i am graced , and may , for aught thou , affected be .
demetrius , thou dost in all , and so in this , to bear me down with braves .
is not the difference of a year or two makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate i am as able and as fit as thou to serve , and to deserve my mistress ' grace , and that my sword upon thee shall approve , and plead my passions for lavinia love .
aside clubs , clubs !
these lovers will not keep the peace .
why , boy , although our mother , unadvised , gave you a by your side , are you so desperate grown , to threat your friends ?
go to , have your lath glued within your sheath till you know better how to handle it .
meanwhile , sir , with the little skill i have , full well shalt thou perceive how much i dare .
ay , boy , grow ye so brave ?
they draw coming forward why , how now , lords !
so near the emperor palace dare you draw , and maintain such a quarrel openly ?
full well i wot the ground of all this grudge i would not for a million of gold the cause were known to them it most concerns , nor would your noble mother for much more be so dishonour in the court of rome .
for shame , put up .
not i , till i have sheathed my rapier in his bosom and withal thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat that he hath breathed in my dishonour here .
for that i am prepared and full resolved .
coward , that with thy tongue , and with thy weapon nothing darest perform !
away , i say !
now , by the gods that warlike goths adore , this petty brabble will undo us all .
why , lords , and think you not how dangerous it is to jet upon a prince right ?
what , is lavinia then become so loose , or bassianus so degenerate , that for her love such quarrels may be broach without controlment , justice , or revenge ?
young lords , beware !
and should the empress know this discord ground , the music would not please .
i care not , i , knew she and all the world i love lavinia more than all the world .
youngling , learn thou to make some meaner choice lavinia is thine elder brother hope .
why , are ye mad ?
or know ye not , in rome how furious and impatient they be , and can not brook competitors in love ?
i tell you , lords , you do but plot your deaths by this device .
aaron , a thousand deaths would i propose to achieve her whom i love .
to achieve her !
how ?
why makest thou it so strange ?
she is a woman , therefore may be woo , she is a woman , therefore may be won , she is lavinia , therefore must be loved .
what , man !
more water glideth by the mill than wots the miller of , and easy it is of a cut loaf to steal a shive , we know though bassianus be the emperor brother .
better than he have worn vulcan badge .
aside ay , and as good as saturninus may .
then why should he despair that knows to court it with words , fair looks and liberality ?
what , hast not thou full often struck a doe , and borne her cleanly by the keeper nose ?
why , then , it seems , some certain snatch or so would serve your turns .
ay , so the turn were served .
aaron , thou hast hit it .
would you had hit it too !
then should not we be tired with this ado .
why , hark ye , hark ye !
and are you such fools to square for this ?
would it offend you , then that both should speed ?
faith , not me .
nor me , so i were one .
for shame , be friends , and join for that you jar is policy and stratagem must do that you affect , and so must you resolve , that what you can not as you would achieve , you must perforce accomplish as you may .
take this of me lucrece was not more chaste than this lavinia , bassianus ' love .
a speedier course than lingering languishment must we pursue , and i have found the path .
my lords , a solemn hunting is in hand , there will the lovely roman ladies troop the forest walks are wide and spacious , and many unfrequented plots there are fitted by kind for rape and villany single you thither then this dainty doe , and strike her home by force , if not by words this way , or not at all , stand you in hope .
come , come , our empress , with her sacred wit to villany and vengeance consecrate , will we acquaint with all that we intend , and she shall file our engines with advice , that will not suffer you to square yourselves , but to your wishes ' height advance you both .
the emperor court is like the house of fame , the palace full of tongues , of eyes , and ears the woods are ruthless , dreadful , deaf , and dull , there speak , and strike , brave boys , and take your turns , there serve your lusts , shadow from heaven eye , and revel in lavinia treasury .
thy counsel , lad , smells of no cowardice , sit fas aut nefas , till i find the stream to cool this heat , a charm to calm these fits .
per styga , per manes vehor .
exeunt scene ii .
a forest near rome .
horns and cry of hounds heard .
enter titus andronicus , with hunters , and , marcus , lucius , quintus , and martius the hunt is up , the morn is bright and grey , the fields are fragrant and the woods are green uncouple here and let us make a bay and wake the emperor and his lovely bride and rouse the prince and ring a hunter peal , that all the court may echo with the noise .
sons , let it be your charge , as it is ours , to attend the emperor person carefully i have been troubled in my sleep this night , but dawning day new comfort hath inspired .
a cry of hounds and horns , winded in a peal .
enter saturninus , tamora , bassianus , lavinia , demetrius , chiron , and attendants many good morrows to your majesty , madam , to you as many and as good i promised your grace a hunter peal .
and you have rung it lustily , my lord , somewhat too early for ladies .
lavinia , how say you ?
i say , no , i have been broad awake two hours and more .
come on , then , horse and chariots let us have , and to our sport .
to tamora madam , now shall ye see our roman hunting .
i have dogs , my lord , will rouse the proudest panther in the chase , and climb the highest promontory top .
and i have horse will follow where the game makes way , and run like swallows the plain .
chiron , we hunt not , we , with horse nor hound , but hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground .
exeunt scene iii .
a lonely part of the forest .
enter aaron , with a bag of gold he that had wit would think that i had none , to bury so much gold under a tree , and never after to inherit it .
let him that thinks of me so abjectly know that this gold must coin a stratagem , which , cunningly effected , will beget a very excellent piece of villany and so repose , sweet gold , for their unrest hides the gold that have their alms out of the empress ' chest .
enter tamora my lovely aaron , wherefore thou sad , when every thing doth make a gleeful boast ?
the birds chant melody on every bush , the snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun , the green leaves quiver with the cooling wind and make a chequer shadow on the ground under their sweet shade , aaron , let us sit , and , whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds , replying shrilly to the horns , as if a double hunt were heard at once , let us sit down and mark their yelping noise , and , after conflict such as was supposed the wandering prince and dido once enjoy , when with a happy storm they were surprised and curtain with a cave , we may , each wreathed in the other arms , our pastimes done , possess a golden slumber , whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds be unto us as is a nurse song of lullaby to bring her babe asleep .
madam , though venus govern your desires , saturn is dominator over mine what signifies my eye , my silence and my cloudy melancholy , my fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls even as an adder when she doth unroll to do some fatal execution ?
no , madam , these are no venereal signs vengeance is in my heart , death in my hand , blood and revenge are hammering in my head .
hark tamora , the empress of my soul , which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee , this is the day of doom for bassianus his philomel must lose her tongue , thy sons make pillage of her chastity and wash their hands in bassianus ' blood .
seest thou this letter ?
take it up , i pray thee , and give the king this fatal plotted scroll .
now question me no more , we are espied , here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty , which dreads not yet their lives ' destruction .
ah , my sweet moor , sweeter to me than life !
no more , great empress , bassianus comes be cross with him , and i go fetch thy sons to back thy quarrels , they be .
exit enter bassianus and lavinia who have we here ?
rome royal empress , unfurnish of her troop ?
or is it dian , habited like her , who hath abandoned her holy groves to see the general hunting in this forest ?
saucy controller of our private steps !
had i the power that some say dian had , thy temples should be planted presently with horns , as was actaeon , and the hounds should drive upon thy limbs , unmannerly intruder as thou art !
under your patience , gentle empress , is thought you have a goodly gift in horning , and to be doubted that your moor and you are singled forth to try experiments jove shield your husband from his hounds !
is pity they should take him for a stag .
believe me , queen , your swarth cimmerian doth make your honour of his body hue , spotted , detested , and abominable .
why are you sequester from all your train , dismounted from your goodly steed .
and wander hither to an obscure plot , accompanied but with a barbarous moor , if foul desire had not conducted you ?
and , being intercepted in your sport , great reason that my noble lord be rated for sauciness .
i pray you , let us hence , and let her joy her love , this valley fits the purpose passing well .
the king my brother shall have note of this .
ay , for these slips have made him noted long good king , to be so mightily abused !
why have i patience to endure all this ?
enter demetrius and chiron how now , dear sovereign , and our gracious mother !
why doth your highness look so pale and wan ?
have i not reason , think you , to look pale ?
these two have me hither to this place a barren detested vale , you see it is , the trees , though summer , yet forlorn and lean , with moss and baleful mistletoe here never shines the sun , here nothing breeds , unless the nightly owl or fatal raven and when they show me this abhorred pit , they told me , here , at dead time of the night , a thousand fiends , a thousand hissing snakes , ten thousand swelling toads , as many urchins , would make such fearful and confused cries as any mortal body hearing it should straight fall mad , or else die suddenly .
no sooner had they told this hellish tale , but straight they told me they would bind me here unto the body of a dismal yew , and leave me to this miserable death and then they call me foul adulteress , lascivious goth , and all the bitterest terms that ever ear did hear to such effect and , had you not by wondrous fortune come , this vengeance on me had they executed .
revenge it , as you love your mother life , or be ye not henceforth call my children .
this is a witness that i am thy son .
stabs bassianus and this for me , struck home to show my strength .
also stabs bassianus , who dies ay , come , semiramis , nay , barbarous tamora , for no name fits thy nature but thy own !
give me thy poniard , you shall know , my boys your mother hand shall right your mother wrong .
stay , madam , here is more belongs to her , first thrash the corn , then after burn the straw this minion stood upon her chastity , upon her nuptial vow , her loyalty , and with that painted hope braves your mightiness and shall she carry this unto her grave ?
an if she do , i would i were an eunuch .
drag hence her husband to some secret hole , and make his dead trunk pillow to our lust .
but when ye have the honey ye desire , let not this wasp outlive , us both to sting .
i warrant you , madam , we wil l make that sure .
come , mistress , now perforce we will enjoy that honesty of yours .
o tamora !
thou a woman face , i will not hear her speak , away with her !
sweet lords , entreat her hear me but a word .
listen , fair madam let it be your glory to see her tears , but be your heart to them as unrelenting flint to drops of rain .
when did the tiger young ones teach the dam ?
o , do not learn her wrath , she taught it thee , the milk thou from her did turn to marble , even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny .
yet every mother breeds not sons alike to chiron do thou entreat her show a woman pity .
what , wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard ?
is true , the raven doth not hatch a lark yet have i heard , o , could i find it now ! the lion moved with pity did endure to have his princely paws pared all away some say that ravens foster forlorn children , the whilst their own birds famish in their nests o , be to me , though thy hard heart say no , nothing so kind , but something pitiful !
i know not what it means , away with her !
o , let me teach thee !
for my father sake , that gave thee life , when well he might have slain thee , be not obdurate , open thy deaf ears .
hadst thou in person offended me , even for his sake am i pitiless .
remember , boys , i pour forth tears in vain , to save your brother from the sacrifice , but fierce andronicus would not relent , therefore , away with her , and use her as you will , the worse to her , the better loved of me .
o tamora , be call a gentle queen , and with thine own hands kill me in this place !
for is not life that i have begg so long , poor i was slain when bassianus died .
what thou , then ?
fond woman , let me go .
is present death i beg , and one thing more that womanhood denies my tongue to tell o , keep me from their worse than killing lust , and tumble me into some loathsome pit , where never man eye may behold my body do this , and be a charitable murderer .
so should i rob my sweet sons of their fee no , let them satisfy their lust on thee .
away !
for thou hast stay us here too long .
no grace ?
no womanhood ?
ah , beastly creature !
the blot and enemy to our general name !
confusion fall nay , then i stop your mouth .
bring thou her husband this is the hole where aaron bid us hide him .
demetrius throws the body of bassianus into the pit , then exeunt demetrius and chiron , dragging off lavinia farewell , my sons see that you make her sure .
let my heart know merry cheer indeed , till all the andronici be made away .
now will i hence to seek my lovely moor , and let my spleenful sons this trull deflow ' r .
exit aaron , with quintus and martius come on , my lords , the better foot before straight will i bring you to the loathsome pit where i espied the panther fast asleep .
my sight is very dull , it bodes .
and mine , i promise you , not for shame , well could i leave our sport to sleep awhile .
falls into the pit what art thou ?
what subtle hole is this , whose mouth is cover with briers , upon whose leaves are drops of blood as fresh as morning dew distill on flowers ?
a very fatal place it seems to me .
speak , brother , hast thou hurt thee with the fall ?
o brother , with the object hurt that ever eye with sight made heart lament !
aside now will i fetch the king to find them here , that he thereby may give a likely guess how these were they that made away his brother .
exit why dost not comfort me , and help me out from this unhallowed and hole ?
i am surprised with an uncouth fear , a chilling sweat my trembling joints my heart suspects more than mine eye can see .
to prove thou hast a heart , aaron and thou look down into this den , and see a fearful sight of blood and death .
aaron is gone , and my compassionate heart will not permit mine eyes once to behold the thing whereat it trembles by surmise , o , tell me how it is , for till now was i a child to fear i know not what .
lord bassianus lies embrewed here , all on a heap , like to a slaughter lamb , in this detested , dark , pit .
if it be dark , how dost thou know is he ?
upon his bloody finger he doth wear a precious ring , that lightens all the hole , which , like a taper in some monument , doth shine upon the dead man earthy cheeks , and shows the ragged entrails of the pit so pale did shine the moon on pyramus when he by night lay bathed in maiden blood .
o brother , help me with thy fainting hand if fear hath made thee faint , as me it hath out of this fell devouring receptacle , as hateful as cocytus ' misty mouth .
reach me thy hand , that i may help thee out , or , wanting strength to do thee so much good , i may be pluck into the swallowing womb of this deep pit , poor bassianus ' grave .
i have no strength to pluck thee to the brink .
nor i no strength to climb without thy help .
thy hand once more , i will not loose again , till thou art here aloft , or i below thou canst not come to me i come to thee .
falls in enter saturninus with aaron along with me i see what hole is here , and what he is that now is leap into it .
say who art thou that lately didst descend into this gaping hollow of the earth ?
the unhappy son of old andronicus brought hither in a most unlucky hour , to find thy brother bassianus dead .
my brother dead !
i know thou dost but jest he and his lady both are at the lodge upon the north side of this pleasant chase , is not an hour since i left him there .
we know not where you left him all alive , but , out , alas !
here have we found him dead .
tamora , with attendants , titus andronicus , and lucius where is my lord the king ?
here , tamora , though grieved with killing grief .
where is thy brother bassianus ?
now to the bottom dost thou search my wound poor bassianus here lies murdered .
then all too late i bring this fatal writ , the complot of this timeless tragedy , and wonder greatly that man face can fold in pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny .
she giveth saturninus a letter reads if we miss to meet him handsomely sweet huntsman , bassianus is we mean do thou so much as dig the grave for him thou our meaning .
look for thy reward among the nettles at the which overshades the mouth of that same pit where we decreed to bury bassianus .
do this , and purchase us thy lasting friends . '
o tamora !
was ever heard the like ?
this is the pit , and this the .
look , sirs , if you can find the huntsman out that should have murdered bassianus here .
my gracious lord , here is the bag of gold .
to titus two of thy whelps , fell curs of bloody kind , have here bereft my brother of his life .
sirs , drag them from the pit unto the prison there let them bide until we have devised some torturing pain for them .
what , are they in this pit ?
o wondrous thing !
how easily murder is discovered !
high emperor , upon my feeble knee i beg this boon , with tears not lightly shed , that this fell fault of my accursed sons , accursed if the fault be proved in them , if it be proved !
you see it is apparent .
who found this letter ?
tamora , was it you ?
andronicus himself did take it up .
i did , my lord yet let me be their bail , for , by my father reverend tomb , i vow they shall be ready at your highness ' will to answer their suspicion with their lives .
thou shalt not bail them see thou follow me .
some bring the murder body , some the murderers let them not speak a word , the guilt is plain , for , by my soul , were there worse end than death , that end upon them should be executed .
andronicus , i will entreat the king , fear not thy sons , they shall do well enough .
come , lucius , come , stay not to talk with them .
exeunt scene iv .
another part of the forest .
enter demetrius and chiron with lavinia , ravished , her hands cut off , and her tongue cut out so , now go tell , an if thy tongue can speak , who was that cut thy tongue and ravish thee .
write down thy mind , bewray thy meaning so , an if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe .
see , how with signs and tokens she can scrowl .
go home , call for sweet water , wash thy hands .
she hath no tongue to call , nor hands to wash , and so let leave her to her silent walks .
an my case , i should go hang myself .
if thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord .
exeunt demetrius and chiron enter marcus who is this ?
my niece , that flies away so fast !
cousin , a word , where is your husband ?
if i do dream , would all my wealth would wake me !
if i do wake , some planet strike me down , that i may slumber in eternal sleep !
speak , gentle niece , what stern ungentle hands have lopp and hew and made thy body bare of her two branches , those sweet ornaments , whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in , and might not gain so great a happiness as have thy love ?
why dost not speak to me ?
alas , a crimson river of warm blood , like to a bubbling fountain stirr with wind , doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips , coming and going with thy honey breath .
but , sure , some tereus hath deflowered thee , and , lest thou shouldst detect him , cut thy tongue .
ah , now thou away thy face for shame !
and , notwithstanding all this loss of blood , as from a conduit with three issuing spouts , yet do thy cheeks look red as titan face blushing to be encountered with a cloud .
shall i speak for thee ?
shall i say is so ?
o , that i knew thy heart , and knew the beast , that i might rail at him , to ease my mind !
sorrow concealed , like an oven stopp , doth burn the heart to cinders where it is .
fair philomela , she but lost her tongue , and in a tedious sampler sew her mind but , lovely niece , that mean is cut from thee , a craftier tereus , cousin , hast thou met , and he hath cut those pretty fingers off , that could have better sew than philomel .
o , had the monster seen those lily hands tremble , like , upon a lute , and make the silken strings delight to kiss them , he would not then have touch them for his life !
or , had he heard the heavenly harmony which that sweet tongue hath made , he would have dropp his knife , and fell asleep as cerberus at the thracian poet feet .
come , let us go , and make thy father blind , for such a sight will blind a father eye one hour storm will drown the fragrant meads , what will whole months of tears thy father eyes ?
do not draw back , for we will mourn with thee o , could our mourning ease thy misery !
exeunt act iii scene rome .
a street .
enter judges , senators and tribunes , with martius and quintus , bound , passing on to the place of execution , titus going before , pleading hear me , grave fathers !
noble tribunes , stay !
for pity of mine age , whose youth was spent in dangerous wars , whilst you securely slept , for all my blood in rome great quarrel shed , for all the frosty nights that i have watch , and for these bitter tears , which now you see filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks , be pitiful to my condemned sons , whose souls are not corrupted as is thought .
for two and twenty sons i never wept , because they died in honour lofty bed .
lieth down , the judges , and , pass by him , and exeunt for these , these , tribunes , in the dust i write my heart deep languor and my soul sad tears let my tears stanch the earth dry appetite , my sons ' sweet blood will make it shame and blush .
o earth , i will befriend thee more with rain , that shall distil from these two ancient urns , than youthful april shall with all his showers in summer drought i drop upon thee still , in winter with warm tears i melt the snow and keep eternal on thy face , so thou refuse to drink my dear sons ' blood .
enter lucius , with his sword drawn o reverend tribunes !
o gentle , aged men !
unbind my sons , reverse the doom of death , and let me say , that never wept before , my tears are now prevailing orators .
o noble father , you lament in vain the tribunes hear you not , no man is by , and you recount your sorrows to a stone .
ah , lucius , for thy brothers let me plead .
grave tribunes , once more i entreat of you , my gracious lord , no tribune hears you speak .
why , tis no matter , man , if they did hear , they would not mark me , or if they did mark , they would not pity me , yet plead i must , therefore i tell my sorrows to the stones , who , though they can not answer my distress , yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes , for that they will not intercept my tale when i do weep , they humbly at my feet receive my tears and seem to weep with me , and , were they but attired in grave weeds , rome could afford no tribune like to these .
a stone is soft as wax , tribunes more hard than stones , a stone is silent , and offendeth not , and tribunes with their tongues doom men to death .
rises but wherefore thou with thy weapon drawn ?
to rescue my two brothers from their death for which attempt the judges have pronounced my everlasting doom of banishment .
o happy man !
they have befriended thee .
why , foolish lucius , dost thou not perceive that rome is but a wilderness of tigers ?
tigers must prey , and rome affords no prey but me and mine how happy art thou , then , from these devourers to be banished !
but who comes with our brother marcus here ?
enter marcus and lavinia titus , prepare thy aged eyes to weep , or , if not so , thy noble heart to break i bring consuming sorrow to thine age .
will it consume me ?
let me see it , then .
this was thy daughter .
why , marcus , so she is .
ay me , this object kills me !
boy , arise , and look upon her .
speak , lavinia , what accursed hand hath made thee handless in thy father sight ?
what fool hath added water to the sea , or brought a faggot to troy ?
my grief was at the height before thou camest , and now like nilus , it disdaineth bounds .
give me a sword , i chop off my hands too , for they have fought for rome , and all in vain , and they have nursed this woe , in feeding life , in bootless prayer have they been held up , and they have served me to effectless use now all the service i require of them is that the one will help to cut the other .
is well , lavinia , that thou hast no hands , for hands , to do rome service , are but vain .
speak , gentle sister , who hath martyr thee ?
o , that delightful engine of her thoughts that blabb them with such pleasing eloquence , is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage , where , like a sweet melodious bird , it sung sweet varied notes , enchanting every ear !
o , say thou for her , who hath done this deed ?
o , thus i found her , straying in the park , seeking to hide herself , as doth the deer that hath received some unrecuring wound .
it was my deer , and he that wounded her hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead for now i stand as one upon a rock environed with a wilderness of sea , who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave , expecting ever when some envious surge will in his brinish bowels swallow him .
this way to death my wretched sons are gone , here stands my other son , a banished man , and here my brother , weeping at my woes .
but that which gives my soul the greatest spurn , is dear lavinia , dearer than my soul .
had i but seen thy picture in this plight , it would have madded me what shall i do now i behold thy lively body so ?
thou hast no hands , to wipe away thy tears nor tongue , to tell me who hath martyr thee thy husband he is dead and for his death thy brothers are condemn , and dead by this .
look , marcus !
ah , son lucius , look on her !
when i did name her brothers , then fresh tears stood on her cheeks , as doth the upon a gather lily almost wither .
perchance she weeps because they kill her husband , perchance because she knows them innocent .
if they did kill thy husband , then be joyful because the law hath revenge on them .
no , no , they would not do so foul a deed , witness the sorrow that their sister makes .
gentle lavinia , let me kiss thy lips .
or make some sign how i may do thee ease shall thy good uncle , and thy brother lucius , and thou , and i , sit round about some fountain , looking all downwards to behold our cheeks how they are stain , as meadows , yet not dry , with miry slime left on them by a flood ?
and in the fountain shall we gaze so long till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness , and made a with our bitter tears ?
or shall we cut away our hands , like thine ?
or shall we bite our tongues , and in dumb shows pass the remainder of our hateful days ?
what shall we do ?
let us , that have our tongues , plot some deuce of further misery , to make us wonder at in time to come .
sweet father , cease your tears , for , at your grief , see how my wretched sister sobs and weeps .
patience , dear niece .
good titus , dry thine eyes .
ah , marcus , marcus !
brother , well i wot thy napkin can not drink a tear of mine , for thou , poor man , hast drown it with thine own .
ah , my lavinia , i will wipe thy cheeks .
mark , marcus , mark !
i understand her signs had she a tongue to speak , now would she say that to her brother which i said to thee his napkin , with his true tears all bewet , can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks .
o , what a sympathy of woe is this , as far from help as limbo is from bliss !
enter aaron titus andronicus , my lord the emperor sends thee this word , that , if thou love thy sons , let marcus , lucius , or thyself , old titus , or any one of you , chop off your hand , and send it to the king he for the same will send thee hither both thy sons alive , and that shall be the ransom for their fault .
o gracious emperor !
o gentle aaron !
did ever raven sing so like a lark , that gives sweet tidings of the sun uprise ?
with all my heart , i send the emperor my hand good aaron , wilt thou help to chop it off ?
stay , father !
for that noble hand of thine , that hath thrown down so many enemies , shall not be sent my hand will serve the turn my youth can better spare my blood than you , and therefore mine shall save my brothers ' lives .
which of your hands hath not defended rome , and rear aloft the bloody , writing destruction on the enemy castle ?
o , none of both but are of high desert my hand hath been but idle , let it serve to ransom my two nephews from their death , then have i kept it to a worthy end .
nay , come , agree whose hand shall go along , for fear they die before their pardon come .
my hand shall go .
by heaven , it shall not go !
sirs , strive no more such wither herbs as these are meet for plucking up , and therefore mine .
sweet father , if i shall be thought thy son , let me redeem my brothers both from death .
and , for our father sake and mother care , now let me show a brother love to thee .
agree between you , i will spare my hand .
then i go fetch an axe .
but i will use the axe .
exeunt lucius and marcus come hither , aaron , i deceive them both lend me thy hand , and i will give thee mine .
aside if that be call deceit , i will be honest , and never , whilst i live , deceive men so but i deceive you in another sort , and that you say , ere half an hour pass .
cuts off titus hand lucius and marcus now stay your strife what shall be is dispatch .
good aaron , give his majesty my hand tell him it was a hand that warded him from thousand dangers , bid him bury it more hath it merited , that let it have .
as for my sons , say i account of them as jewels purchased at an easy price , and yet dear too , because i bought mine own .
i go , andronicus and for thy hand look by and by to have thy sons with thee .
aside their heads , i mean .
o , how this villany doth fat me with the very thoughts of it !
let fools do good , and fair men call for grace .
aaron will have his soul black like his face .
exit o , here i lift this one hand up to heaven , and bow this feeble ruin to the earth if any power pities wretched tears , to that i call !
to lavinia what , wilt thou kneel with me ?
do , then , dear heart , for heaven shall hear our prayers , or with our sighs we breathe the welkin dim , and stain the sun with fog , as sometime clouds when they do hug him in their melting bosoms .
o brother , speak with possibilities , and do not break into these deep extremes .
is not my sorrow deep , having no bottom ?
then be my passions bottomless with them .
but yet let reason govern thy lament .
if there were reason for these miseries , then into limits could i bind my woes when heaven doth weep , doth not the earth ?
if the winds rage , doth not the sea wax mad , threatening the welkin with his face ?
and wilt thou have a reason for this coil ?
i am the sea , hark , how her sighs do blow !
she is the weeping welkin , i the earth then must my sea be moved with her sighs , then must my earth with her continual tears become a deluge , overflow and drown , for why my bowels can not hide her woes , but like a drunkard must i vomit them .
then give me leave , for losers will have leave to ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues .
enter a messenger , with two heads and a hand worthy andronicus , ill art thou repaid for that good hand thou the emperor .
here are the heads of thy two noble sons , and here thy hand , in scorn to thee sent back , thy griefs their sports , thy resolution mock , that woe is me to think upon thy woes more than remembrance of my father death .
exit now let hot aetna cool in sicily , and be my heart an hell !
these miseries are more than may be borne .
to weep with them that weep doth ease some deal , but sorrow flouted at is double death .
ah , that this sight should make so deep a wound , and yet detested life not shrink thereat !
that ever death should let life bear his name , where life hath no more interest but to breathe !
lavinia kisses titus alas , poor heart , that kiss is comfortless as frozen water to a starved snake .
when will this fearful slumber have an end ?
now , farewell , flattery die , andronicus , thou dost not slumber see , thy two sons ' heads , thy warlike hand , thy mangled daughter here thy other banish son , with this dear sight struck pale and bloodless , and thy brother , i , even like a stony image , cold and numb .
ah , now no more will i control thy griefs rend off thy silver hair , thy other hand gnawing with thy teeth , and be this dismal sight the closing up of our most wretched eyes , now is a time to storm , why art thou still ?
ha , ha , ha !
why dost thou laugh ?
it fits not with this hour .
why , i have not another tear to shed besides , this sorrow is an enemy , and would usurp upon my watery eyes and make them blind with tributary tears then which way shall i find revenge cave ?
for these two heads do seem to speak to me , and threat me i shall never come to bliss till all these mischiefs be return again even in their throats that have committed them .
come , let me see what task i have to do .
you heavy people , circle me about , that i may turn me to each one of you , and swear unto my soul to right your wrongs .
the vow is made .
come , brother , take a head , and in this hand the other i will bear .
lavinia , thou shalt be employ these arms !
bear thou my hand , sweet wench , between thy teeth .
as for thee , boy , go get thee from my sight , thou art an exile , and thou must not stay hie to the goths , and raise an army there and , if you love me , as i think you do , let kiss and part , for we have much to do .
exeunt titus , marcus , and lavinia farewell andronicus , my noble father , the man that ever lived in rome farewell , proud rome , till lucius come again , he leaves his pledges dearer than his life farewell , lavinia , my noble sister , o , would thou wert as thou tofore hast been !
but now nor lucius nor lavinia lives but in oblivion and hateful griefs .
if lucius live , he will requite your wrongs , and make proud saturnine and his empress beg at the gates , like tarquin and his queen .
now will i to the goths , and raise a power , to be revenged on rome and saturnine .
exit scene ii .
a room in titus house .
a banquet set out .
enter titus , marcus , lavinia and young lucius , a boy so , so , now sit and look you eat no more than will preserve just so much strength in us as will revenge these bitter woes of ours .
marcus , unknit that knot thy niece and i , poor creatures , want our hands , and can not passionate our tenfold grief with folded arms .
this poor right hand of mine is left to tyrannize upon my breast , who , when my heart , all mad with misery , beats in this hollow prison of my flesh , then thus i thump it down .
to lavinia thou map of woe , that thus dost talk in signs !
when thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating , thou canst not strike it thus to make it still .
wound it with sighing , girl , kill it with groans , or get some little knife between thy teeth , and just against thy heart make thou a hole , that all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall may run into that sink , and soaking in drown the lamenting fool in tears .
fie , brother , fie !
teach her not thus to lay such violent hands upon her tender life .
how now !
has sorrow made thee dote already ?
why , marcus , no man should be mad but i .
what violent hands can she lay on her life ?
ah , wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands , to bid aeneas tell the tale twice , how troy was burnt and he made miserable ?
o , handle not the theme , to talk of hands , lest we remember still that we have none .
fie , fie , how franticly i square my talk , as if we should forget we had no hands , if marcus did not name the word of hands !
come , let fall to , and , gentle girl , eat this here is no drink !
hark , marcus , what she says , i can interpret all her martyr signs , she says she drinks no other drink but tears , brew with her sorrow , mesh upon her cheeks speechless complainer , i will learn thy thought , in thy dumb action will i be as perfect as begging hermits in their holy prayers thou shalt not sigh , nor hold thy stumps to heaven , nor wink , nor nod , nor kneel , nor make a sign , but i of these will wrest an alphabet and by still practise learn to know thy meaning .
good grandsire , leave these bitter deep laments make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale .
alas , the tender boy , in passion moved , doth weep to see his grandsire heaviness .
peace , tender sapling , thou art made of tears , and tears will quickly melt thy life away .
marcus strikes the dish with a knife what dost thou strike at , marcus , with thy knife ?
at that that i have kill , my lord , a fly .
out on thee , murderer !
thou my heart , mine eyes are cloy with view of tyranny a deed of death done on the innocent becomes not titus ' brother get thee gone i see thou art not for my company .
alas , my lord , i have but kill a fly .
but how , if that fly had a father and mother ?
how would he hang his slender gilded wings , and buzz lamenting doings in the air !
poor harmless fly , that , with his pretty buzzing melody , came here to make us merry !
and thou hast kill him .
pardon me , sir , it was a black fly , like to the empress ' moor , therefore i kill him .
o , o , o , then pardon me for reprehending thee , for thou hast done a charitable deed .
give me thy knife , i will insult on him , flattering myself , as if it were the moor come hither purposely to poison there for thyself , and that for tamora .
ah , sirrah !
yet , i think , we are not brought so low , but that between us we can kill a fly that comes in likeness of a moor .
alas , poor man !
grief has so wrought on him , he takes false shadows for true substances .
come , take away .
lavinia , go with me i to thy closet , and go read with thee sad stories chanced in the times of old .
come , boy , and go with me thy sight is young , and thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle .
exeunt act iv scene rome .
titus garden .
enter young lucius , and lavinia running after him , and the boy flies from her , with books under his arm .
then enter titus and marcus help , grandsire , help !
my aunt lavinia follows me every where , i know not why good uncle marcus , see how swift she comes .
alas , sweet aunt , i know not what you mean .
stand by me , lucius , do not fear thine aunt .
she loves thee , boy , too well to do thee harm .
ay , when my father was in rome she did .
what means my niece lavinia by these signs ?
fear her not , lucius somewhat doth she mean see , lucius , see how much she makes of thee somewhither would she have thee go with her .
ah , boy , cornelia never with more care read to her sons than she hath read to thee sweet poetry and tully orator .
canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus ?
my lord , i know not , i , nor can i guess , unless some fit or frenzy do possess her for i have heard my grandsire say full oft , extremity of griefs would make men mad , and i have read that hecuba of troy ran mad through sorrow that made me to fear , although , my lord , i know my noble aunt loves me as dear as my mother did , and would not , but in fury , fright my youth which made me down to throw my books , and fly causeless , perhaps .
but pardon me , sweet aunt and , madam , if my uncle marcus go , i will most willingly attend your ladyship .
lucius , i will .
lavinia turns over with her stumps the books which lucius has let fall how now , lavinia !
marcus , what means this ?
some book there is that she desires to see .
which is it , girl , of these ?
open them , boy .
but thou art deeper read , and better skill come , and take choice of all my library , and so beguile thy sorrow , till the heavens reveal the damn contriver of this deed .
why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus ?
i think she means that there was more than one confederate in the fact ay , more there was , or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge .
lucius , what book is that she tosseth so ?
grandsire , is ovid metamorphoses , my mother gave it me .
for love of her that gone , perhaps she cull it from among the rest .
soft !
see how busily she turns the leaves !
helping her what would she find ?
lavinia , shall i read ?
this is the tragic tale of philomel , and treats of tereus ' treason and his rape and rape , i fear , was root of thine annoy .
see , brother , see , note how she quotes the leaves .
lavinia , wert thou thus surprised , sweet girl , ravish and wrong , as philomela was , forced in the ruthless , vast , and gloomy woods ?
see , see !
ay , such a place there is , where we did hunt o , had we never , never hunted there ! pattern by that the poet here describes , by nature made for murders and for rapes .
o , why should nature build so foul a den , unless the gods delight in tragedies ?
give signs , sweet girl , for here are none but friends , what roman lord it was durst do the deed or slunk not saturnine , as tarquin erst , that left the camp to sin in lucrece ' bed ?
sit down , sweet niece brother , sit down by me .
apollo , pallas , jove , or mercury , inspire me , that i may this treason find !
my lord , look here look here , lavinia this sandy plot is plain , guide , if thou canst this after me , when i have writ my name without the help of any hand at all .
he writes his name with his staff , and guides it with feet and mouth cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift !
write thou good niece , and here display , at last , what god will have discover for revenge , heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain , that we may know the traitors and the truth !
she takes the staff in her mouth , and guides it with her stumps , and writes o , do ye read , my lord , what she hath writ ?
.
chiron .
demetrius . '
what , what !
the lustful sons of tamora performers of this heinous , bloody deed ?
magni dominator poli , tam lentus audis scelera ?
tam lentus vides ?
o , calm thee , gentle lord , although i know there is enough written upon this earth to stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts and arm the minds of infants to exclaims .
my lord , kneel down with me , lavinia , kneel , and kneel , sweet boy , the roman hector hope , and swear with me , as , with the woful fere and father of that chaste dishonour dame , lord junius brutus sware for lucrece ' rape , that we will prosecute by good advice mortal revenge upon these traitorous goths , and see their blood , or die with this reproach .
is sure enough , an you knew how .
but if you hunt these , then beware the dam will wake , and , if she wind you once , she with the lion deeply still in league , and lulls him whilst she playeth on her back , and when he sleeps will she do what she list .
you are a young huntsman , marcus , let it alone , and , come , i will go get a leaf of brass , and with a gad of steel will write these words , and lay it by the angry northern wind will blow these sands , like sibyl leaves , abroad , and where your lesson , then ?
boy , what say you ?
i say , my lord , that if i were a man , their mother should not be safe for these bad bondmen to the yoke of rome .
ay , that my boy !
thy father hath full oft for his ungrateful country done the like .
and , uncle , so will i , an if i live .

exeunt titus , lavinia , and young lucius o heavens , can you hear a good man groan , and not relent , or not compassion him ?
marcus , attend him in his ecstasy , that hath more scars of sorrow in his heart than foemen marks upon his batter shield , but yet so just that he will not revenge .
revenge , ye heavens , for old andronicus !
exit scene ii .
the same .
a room in the palace .
enter , from one side , aaron , demetrius , and chiron , from the other side , young lucius , and an attendant , with a bundle of weapons , and verses writ upon them demetrius , here the son of lucius , he hath some message to deliver us .
ay , some mad message from his mad grandfather .
my lords , with all the humbleness i may , i greet your honours from andronicus .
aside and pray the roman gods confound you both !
gramercy , lovely lucius what the news ?
aside that you are both decipher , that the news , for villains mark with may it please you , my grandsire , well advised , hath sent by me the goodliest weapons of his armoury to gratify your honourable youth , the hope of rome , for so he bade me say , and so i do , and with his gifts present your lordships , that , whenever you have need , you may be armed and appointed well and so i leave you both aside like bloody villains .
exeunt young lucius , and attendant what here ?
a scroll , and written round about ?
let see , reads vitae , scelerisque purus , non eget mauri jaculis , nec arcu . '
o , is a verse in horace , i know it well i read it in the grammar long ago .
ay , just , a verse in horace , right , you have it .
aside now , what a thing it is to be an ass !
here no sound jest !
the old man hath found their guilt , and sends them weapons wrapped about with lines , that wound , beyond their feeling , to the quick .
but were our witty empress well afoot , she would applaud andronicus ' conceit but let her rest in her unrest awhile .
and now , young lords , not a happy star led us to rome , strangers , and more than so , captives , to be advanced to this height ?
it did me good , before the palace gate to brave the tribune in his brother hearing .
but me more good , to see so great a lord basely insinuate and send us gifts .
had he not reason , lord demetrius ?
did you not use his daughter very friendly ?
i would we had a thousand roman dames at such a bay , by turn to serve our lust .
a charitable wish and full of love .
here lacks but your mother for to say amen .
and that would she for twenty thousand more .
come , let us go , and pray to all the gods for our beloved mother in her pains .
aside pray to the devils , the gods have given us over .
trumpets sound within why do the emperor trumpets flourish thus ?
belike , for joy the emperor hath a son .
soft !
who comes here ?
enter a nurse , with a blackamoor child in her arms good morr ow , lords o , tell me , did you see aaron the moor ?
well , more or less , or a whit at all , here aaron is , and what with aaron now ?
o gentle aaron , we are all undone !
now help , or woe betide thee evermore !
why , what a caterwauling dost thou keep !
what dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms ?
o , that which i would hide from heaven eye , our empress ' shame , and stately rome disgrace !
she is deliver , lords , she is deliver .
to whom ?
i mean , she is brought .
well , god give her good rest !
what hath he sent her ?
a devil .
why , then she is the devil dam , a joyful issue .
a joyless , dismal , black , and sorrowful issue here is the babe , as loathsome as a toad amongst the fairest breeders of our clime the empress sends it thee , thy stamp , thy seal , and bids thee christen it with thy dagger point .
, ye whore !
is black so base a hue ?
sweet blowse , you are a beauteous blossom , sure .
villain , what hast thou done ?
that which thou canst not undo .
thou hast undone our mother .
villain , i have done thy mother .
and therein , hellish dog , thou hast undone .
woe to her chance , and damn her loathed choice !
accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend !
it shall not live .
it shall not die .
aaron , it must , the mother wills it so .
what , must it , nurse ?
then let no man but i do execution on my flesh and blood .
i broach the tadpole on my rapier point nurse , give it me , my sword shall soon dispatch it .
sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up .
takes the child from the nurse , and draws stay , murderous villains !
will you kill your brother ?
now , by the burning tapers of the sky , that shone so brightly when this boy was got , he dies upon my scimitar sharp point that touches this my son and heir !
i tell you , younglings , not enceladus , with all his threatening band of typhon brood , nor great alcides , nor the god of war , shall seize this prey out of his father hands .
what , what , ye sanguine , boys !
ye walls !
ye alehouse painted signs !
is better than another hue , in that it scorns to bear another hue , for all the water in the ocean can never turn the swan black legs to white , although she lave them hourly in the flood .
tell the empress from me , i am of age to keep mine own , excuse it how she can .
wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus ?
my mistress is my mistress , this myself , the vigour and the picture of my youth this before all the world do i prefer , this maugre all the world will i keep safe , or some of you shall smoke for it in rome .
by this our mother is forever shamed .
rome will despise her for this foul escape .
the emperor , in his rage , will doom her death .
i blush to think upon this ignomy .
why , there the privilege your beauty bears fie , treacherous hue , that will betray with blushing the close enacts and counsels of the heart !
here a young lad framed of another leer look , how the black slave smiles upon the father , as who should say lad , i am thine own . '
he is your brother , lords , sensibly fed of that that first gave life to you , and from that womb where you imprison were he is enfranchised and come to light nay , he is your brother by the surer side , although my seal be stamped in his face .
aaron , what shall i say unto the empress ?
advise thee , aaron , what is to be done , and we will all subscribe to thy advice save thou the child , so we may all be safe .
then sit we down , and let us all consult .
my son and i will have the wind of you keep there now talk at pleasure of your safety .
they sit how many women saw this child of his ?
why , so , brave lords !
when we join in league , i am a lamb but if you brave the moor , the chafed boar , the mountain lioness , the ocean swells not so as aaron storms .
but say , again , how many saw the child ?
cornelia the midwife and myself , and no one else but the deliver empress .
the empress , the midwife , and yourself two may keep counsel when the third away go to the empress , tell her this i said .
he kills the nurse weke , weke !
so cries a pig prepared to the spit .
what thou , aaron ?
wherefore didst thou this ?
o lord , sir , is a deed of policy shall she live to betray this guilt of ours , a babbling gossip ?
no , lords , no and now be it known to you my full intent .
not far , one muli lives , my countryman , his wife but yesternight was brought to bed , his child is like to her , fair as you are go pack with him , and give the mother gold , and tell them both the circumstance of all , and how by this their child shall be advanced , and be received for the emperor heir , and substituted in the place of mine , to calm this tempest whirling in the court , and let the emperor dandle him for his own .
hark ye , lords , ye see i have given her physic , pointing to the nurse and you must needs bestow her funeral , the fields are near , and you are gallant grooms this done , see that you take no longer days , but send the midwife presently to me .
the midwife and the nurse well made away , then let the ladies tattle what they please .
aaron , i see thou wilt not trust the air with secrets .
for this care of tamora , herself and hers are highly bound to thee .
exeunt demetrius and chiron bearing off the nurse body now to the goths , as swift as swallow flies , there to dispose this treasure in mine arms , and secretly to greet the empress ' friends .
come on , you thick lipp slave , i bear you hence , for it is you that puts us to our shifts i make you feed on berries and on roots , and feed on curds and whey , and suck the goat , and cabin in a cave , and bring you up to be a warrior , and command a camp .

go , get you gone , and pray be careful all , and leave you not a unsearch this wicked emperor may have shipp her hence , and , kinsmen , then we may go pipe for justice .
o publius , is not this a heavy case , to see thy noble uncle thus distract ?
therefore , my lord , it highly us concerns by day and night to attend him carefully , and feed his humour kindly as we may , till time beget some careful remedy .
kinsmen , his sorrows are past remedy .
join with the goths , and with revengeful war take wreak on rome for this ingratitude , and vengeance on the traitor saturnine .

he doth me wrong to feed me with delays .
i dive into the burning lake below , and pull her out of acheron by the heels .
marcus , we are but shrubs , no cedars we no men framed of the cyclops ' size , but metal , marcus , steel to the very back , yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear and , sith there no justice in earth nor hell , we will solicit heaven and move the gods to send down justice for to wreak our wrongs .

see , see , thou hast shot off one of taurus ' horns .
this was the sport , my lord when publius shot , the bull , being gall , gave aries such a knock that down fell both the ram horns in the court , and who should find them but the empress ' villain ?

why , there it goes god give his lordship joy !

alas , sir , i never came there god forbid i should be so bold to press to heaven in my young days .
why , i am going with my pigeons to the tribunal plebs , to take up a matter of brawl betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial men .
why , sir , that is as fit as can be to serve for your oration , and let him deliver the pigeons to the emperor from you .
tell me , can you deliver an oration to the emperor with a grace ?
nay , truly , sir , i could never say grace in all my life .

exeunt scene iv .

before the palace .
enter saturninus , tamora , demetrius , chiron , lords , and others , saturninus with the arrows in his hand that titus shot why , lords , what wrongs are these !
was ever seen an emperor in rome thus overborne , troubled , confronted thus , and , for the extent of egal justice , used in such contempt ?
my lords , you know , as know the mightful gods , however these disturbers of our peace buz in the people ears , there nought hath pass , but even with law , against the willful sons of old andronicus .
and what an if his sorrows have so overwhelm his wits , shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks , his fits , his frenzy , and his bitterness ?
and now he writes to heaven for his redress see , here to jove , and this to mercury , this to apollo , this to the god of war , sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of rome !
what this but libelling against the senate , and blazoning our injustice every where ?
a goodly humour , is it not , my lords ?
as who would say , in rome no justice were .
but if i live , his feigned ecstasies shall be no shelter to these outrages but he and his shall know that justice lives in saturninus ' health , whom , if she sleep , he so awake as she in fury shall cut off the conspirator that lives .
my gracious lord , my lovely saturnine , lord of my life , commander of my thoughts , calm thee , and bear the faults of titus ' age , the effects of sorrow for his valiant sons , whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr his heart , and rather comfort his distressed plight than prosecute the meanest or the best for these contempts .
aside why , thus it shall become tamora to gloze with all but , titus , i have touched thee to the quick , thy out if aaron now be wise , then is all safe , the anchor in the port .
enter clown how now , good fellow !
wouldst thou speak with us ?
yea , forsooth , an your mistership be emperial .
empress i am , but yonder sits the emperor .
is he .
god and saint stephen give you good den i have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here .
saturninus reads the letter go , take him away , and hang him presently .
how much money must i have ?
come , sirrah , you must be hanged .
hanged !
by ' r lady , then i have brought up a neck to a fair end .
exit , guarded despiteful and intolerable wrongs !
shall i endure this monstrous villany ?
i know from whence this same device proceeds may this be borne ? as if his traitorous sons , that died by law for murder of our brother , have by my means been butcher wrongfully !
go , drag the villain hither by the hair , nor age nor honour shall shape privilege for this proud mock i be thy slaughterman , sly frantic wretch , that to make me great , in hope thyself should govern rome and me .
enter aemilius what news with thee , aemilius ?
arm , arm , my lord , rome never had more cause .
the goths have gather head , and with a power men , bent to the spoil , they hither march amain , under conduct of lucius , son to old andronicus , who threats , in course of this revenge , to do as much as ever coriolanus did .
is warlike lucius general of the goths ?
these tidings nip me , and i hang the head as flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms ay , now begin our sorrows to approach is he the common people love so much , myself hath often them say , when i have walked like a private man , that lucius ' banishment was wrongfully , and they have wish that lucius were their emperor .
why should you fear ?
is not your city strong ?
ay , but the citizens favor lucius , and will revolt from me to succor him .
king , be thy thoughts imperious , like thy name .
is the sun dimm , that gnats do fly in it ?
the eagle suffers little birds to sing , and is not careful what they mean thereby , knowing that with the shadow of his wings he can at pleasure stint their melody even so mayst thou the giddy men of rome .
then cheer thy spirit for know , thou emperor , i will enchant the old andronicus with words more sweet , and yet more dangerous , than baits to fish , or to sheep , when as the one is wounded with the bait , the other rotted with delicious feed .
but he will not entreat his son for us .
if tamora entreat him , then he will for i can smooth and fill his aged ear with golden promises , that , were his heart almost impregnable , his old ears deaf , yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue .
to aemilius go thou before , be our ambassador say that the emperor requests a parley of warlike lucius , and appoint the meeting even at his father house , the old andronicus .
aemilius , do this message honourably and if he stand on hostage for his safety , bid him demand what pledge will please him best .
your bidding shall i do effectually .
exit now will i to that old andronicus , and temper him with all the art i have , to pluck proud lucius from the warlike goths .
and now , sweet emperor , be blithe again , and bury all thy fear in my devices .
then go successantly , and plead to him .
exeunt act v scene plains near rome .
enter lucius with an army of goths , with drum and colours approved warriors , and my faithful friends , i have received letters from great rome , which signify what hate they bear their emperor and how desirous of our sight they are .
therefore , great lords , be , as your titles witness , imperious and impatient of your wrongs , and wherein rome hath done you any scath , let him make treble satisfaction .
brave slip , sprung from the great andronicus , whose name was once our terror , now our comfort , whose high exploits and honourable deeds ingrateful rome requites with foul contempt , be bold in us we follow where thou , like stinging bees in hottest summer day led by their master to the flowered fields , and be avenged on cursed tamora .
and as he saith , so say we all with him .
i humbly thank him , and i thank you all .
but who comes here , led by a lusty goth ?
enter a goth , leading aaron with his child in his arms renowned lucius , from our troops i stray to gaze upon a ruinous monastery , and , as i earnestly did fix mine eye upon the wasted building , suddenly i heard a child cry underneath a wall .
i made unto the noise , when soon i heard the crying babe controll with this discourse , tawny slave , half me and half thy dam !
did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art , had nature lent thee but thy mother look , villain , thou mightst have been an emperor but where the bull and cow are both , they never do beget a calf .
peace , villain , peace ! '
even thus he rates the babe , i must bear thee to a trusty goth , who , when he knows thou art the empress ' babe , will hold thee dearly for thy mother sake . '
with this , my weapon drawn , i rush upon him , surprised him suddenly , and brought him hither , to use as you think needful of the man .
o worthy goth , this is the incarnate devil that robb andronicus of his good hand , this is the pearl that pleased your empress ' eye , and here the base fruit of his burning lust .
say , slave , whither wouldst thou convey this growing image of thy face ?
why dost not speak ?
what , deaf ?
not a word ?
a halter , soldiers !
hang him on this tree .
and by his side his fruit of bastardy .
touch not the boy , he is of royal blood .
too like the sire for ever being good .
first hang the child , that he may see it sprawl , a sight to vex the father soul withal .
get me a ladder .
a ladder brought , which aaron is made to ascend lucius , save the child , and bear it from me to the empress .
if thou do this , i show thee wondrous things , that highly may advantage thee to hear if thou wilt not , befall what may befall , i speak no more but rot you all ! '
say on an if it please me which thou thy child shall live , and i will see it nourish .
an if it please thee !
why , assure thee , lucius , vex thy soul to hear what i shall speak , for i must talk of murders , rapes and massacres , acts of black night , abominable deeds , complots of mischief , treason , villanies ruthful to hear , yet piteously perform and this shall all be buried by my death , unless thou swear to me my child shall live .
tell on thy mind , i say thy child shall live .
swear that he shall , and then i will begin .
who should i swear by ?
thou believest no god that granted , how canst thou believe an oath ?
what if i do not ?
as , indeed , i do not , yet , for i know thou art religious and hast a thing within thee called conscience , with twenty popish tricks and ceremonies , which i have seen thee careful to observe , therefore i urge thy oath , for that i know an idiot holds his bauble for a god and keeps the oath which by that god he swears , to that i urge him therefore thou shalt vow by that same god , what god it be , that thou adorest and hast in reverence , to save my boy , to nourish and bring him up , or else i will discover nought to thee .
even by my god i swear to thee i will .
first know thou , i begot him on the empress .
o most insatiate and luxurious woman !
tut , lucius , this was but a deed of charity to that which thou shalt hear of me anon .
was her two sons that murder bassianus , they cut thy sister tongue and ravish her and cut her hands and trimm her as thou .
o detestable villain !
thou that trimming ?
why , she was wash and cut and trimm , and was trim sport for them that had the doing of it .
o barbarous , beastly villains , like thyself !
indeed , i was their tutor to instruct them that codding spirit had they from their mother , as sure a card as ever won the set , that bloody mind , i think , they learn of me , as true a dog as ever fought at head .
well , let my deeds be witness of my worth .
i train thy brethren to that guileful hole where the dead corpse of bassianus lay i wrote the letter that thy father found and hid the gold within the letter mention , confederate with the queen and her two sons and what not done , that thou hast cause to rue , wherein i had no stroke of mischief in it ?
i play the cheater for thy father hand , and , when i had it , drew myself apart and almost broke my heart with extreme laughter i pry me through the crevice of a wall when , for his hand , he had his two sons ' heads , beheld his tears , and laugh so heartily , that both mine eyes were rainy like to his and when i told the empress of this sport , she swooned almost at my pleasing tale , and for my tidings gave me twenty kisses .
what , canst thou say all this , and never blush ?
ay , like a black dog , as the saying is .
art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds ?
ay , that i had not done a thousand more .
even now i curse the day and yet , i think , few come within the compass of my curse , wherein i did not some notorious ill , as kill a man , or else devise his death , ravish a maid , or plot the way to do it , accuse some innocent and forswear myself , set deadly enmity between two friends , make poor men cattle break their necks , set fire on barns and in the night , and bid the owners quench them with their tears .
oft have i digg up dead men from their graves , and set them upright at their dear friends ' doors , even when their sorrows almost were forgot , and on their skins , as on the bark of trees , have with my knife carved in roman letters , not your sorrow die , though i am dead . '
tut , i have done a thousand dreadful things as willingly as one would kill a fly , and nothing grieves me heartily indeed but that i can not do ten thousand more .
bring down the devil , for he must not die so sweet a death as hanging presently .
if there be devils , would i were a devil , to live and burn in everlasting fire , so i might have your company in hell , but to torment you with my bitter tongue !
sirs , stop his mouth , and let him speak no more .
enter a goth my lord , there is a messenger from rome desires to be admitted to your presence .
let him come near .
enter aemilius welcome , aemilius what the news from rome ?
lord lucius , and you princes of the goths , the roman emperor greets you all by me , and , for he understands you are in arms , he craves a parley at your father house , willing you to demand your hostages , and they shall be immediately deliver .
what says our general ?
aemilius , let the emperor give his pledges unto my father and my uncle marcus , and we will come .
march away .
exeunt scene ii .
rome .
before titus house .
enter tamora , demetrius , and chiron , disguised thus , in this strange and sad habiliment , i will encounter with andronicus , and say i am revenge , sent from below to join with him and right his heinous wrongs .
knock at his study , where , they say , he keeps , to ruminate strange plots of dire revenge , tell him revenge is come to join with him , and work confusion on his enemies .
they knock enter titus , above who doth molest my contemplation ?
is it your trick to make me ope the door , that so my sad decrees may fly away , and all my study be to no effect ?
you are deceived for what i mean to do see here in bloody lines i have set down , and what is written shall be executed .
titus , i am come to talk with thee .
no , not a word , how can i grace my talk , wanting a hand to give it action ?
thou hast the odds of me , therefore no more .
if thou didst know me , thou wouldest talk with me .
i am not mad , i know thee well enough witness this wretched stump , witness these crimson lines , witness these trenches made by grief and care , witness the tiring day and heavy night , witness all sorrow , that i know thee well for our proud empress , mighty tamora is not thy coming for my other hand ?
know , thou sad man , i am not tamora , she is thy enemy , and i thy friend i am revenge sent from the infernal kingdom , to ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind , by working wreakful vengeance on thy foes .
come down , and welcome me to this world light , confer with me of murder and of death there not a hollow cave or , no vast obscurity or misty vale , where bloody murder or detested rape can couch for fear , but i will find them out , and in their ears tell them my dreadful name , revenge , which makes the foul offender quake .
art thou revenge ?
and art thou sent to me , to be a torment to mine enemies ?
i am , therefore come down , and welcome me .
do me some service , ere i come to thee .
lo , by thy side where rape and murder stands , now give me some surance that thou art revenge , stab them , or tear them on thy , and then i come and be thy waggoner , and whirl along with thee about the globe .
provide thee two proper palfreys , black as jet , to hale thy vengeful waggon swift away , and find out murderers in their guilty caves and when thy car is loaden with their heads , i will dismount , and by the trot , like a servile footman , all day long , even from hyperion rising in the east until his very downfall in the sea and day by day i do this heavy task , so thou destroy rapine and murder there .
these are my ministers , and come with me .
are these thy ministers ?
what are they call ?
rapine and murder , therefore called so , cause they take vengeance of such kind of men .
good lord , how like the empress ' sons they are !
and you , the empress !
but we worldly men have miserable , mad , mistaking eyes .
o sweet revenge , now do i come to thee , and , if one arm embracement will content thee , i will embrace thee in it by and by .
exit above this closing with him fits his lunacy i forge to feed his fits , do you uphold and maintain in your speeches , for now he firmly takes me for revenge , and , being credulous in this mad thought , i make him send for lucius his son , and , whilst i at a banquet hold him sure , i find some cunning practise out of hand , to scatter and disperse the giddy goths , or , at the least , make them his enemies .
see , here he comes , and i must ply my theme .
enter titus below long have i been forlorn , and all for thee welcome , dread fury , to my woful house rapine and murder , you are welcome too .
how like the empress and her sons you are !
well are you fitted , had you but a moor could not all hell afford you such a devil ?
for well i wot the empress never wags but in her company there is a moor , and , would you represent our queen aright , it were convenient you had such a devil but welcome , as you are .
what shall we do ?
what wouldst thou have us do , andronicus ?
show me a murderer , i deal with him .
show me a villain that hath done a rape , and i am sent to be revenged on him .
show me a thousand that have done thee wrong , and i will be revenged on them all .
look round about the wicked streets of rome , and when thou a man that like thyself .
good murder , stab him , he a murderer .
go thou with him , and when it is thy hap to find another that is like to thee , good rapine , stab him , he a ravisher .
go thou with them , and in the emperor court there is a queen , attended by a moor , well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion , for up and down she doth resemble thee i pray thee , do on them some violent death , they have been violent to me and mine .
well hast thou lesson us , this shall we do .
but would it please thee , good andronicus , to send for lucius , thy son , who leads towards rome a band of warlike goths , and bid him come and banquet at thy house , when he is here , even at thy solemn feast , i will bring in the empress and her sons , the emperor himself and all thy foes , and at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel , and on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart .
what says andronicus to this device ?
marcus , my brother !
is sad titus calls .
enter marcus go , gentle marcus , to thy nephew lucius , thou shalt inquire him out among the goths bid him repair to me , and bring with him some of the chiefest princes of the goths , bid him encamp his soldiers where they are tell him the emperor and the empress too feast at my house , and he shall feast with them .
this do thou for my love , and so let him , as he regards his aged father life .
this will i do , and soon return again .
exit now will i hence about thy business , and take my ministers along with me .
nay , nay , let rape and murder stay with me , or else i call my brother back again , and cleave to no revenge but lucius .
aside to her sons what say you , boys ?
will you bide with him , whiles i go tell my lord the emperor how i have govern our determined jest ?
yield to his humour , smooth and speak him fair , and tarry with him till i turn again .
aside i know them all , though they suppose me mad , and will them in their own devices a pair of cursed and their dam !
madam , depart at pleasure , leave us here .
farewell , andronicus revenge now goes to lay a complot to betray thy foes .
i know thou dost , and , sweet revenge , farewell .

caius and valentine , lay hands on them .
oft have you heard me wish for such an hour , and now i find it , therefore bind them sure , and stop their mouths , if they begin to cry .
exit publius , and lay hold on chiron and demetrius villains , forbear !
we are the empress ' sons .
and therefore do we what we are commanded .
stop close their mouths , let them not speak a word .

look that you bind them fast .
titus , with lavinia , he bearing a knife , and she a basin come , come , lavinia , look , thy foes are bound .
sirs , stop their mouths , let them not speak to me , but let them hear what fearful words i utter .
o villains , chiron and demetrius !
here stands the spring whom you have stain with mud , this goodly summer with your winter mix .
you kill her husband , and for that vile fault two of her brothers were condemn to death , my hand cut off and made a merry jest , both her sweet hands , her tongue , and that more dear than hands or tongue , her spotless chastity , inhuman traitors , you constrain and forced .
what would you say , if i should let you speak ?
villains , for shame you could not beg for grace .
hark , wretches !
how i mean to martyr you .
this one hand yet is left to cut your throats , whilst that lavinia her stumps doth hold the basin that receives your guilty blood .
you know your mother means to feast with me , and calls herself revenge , and thinks me mad hark , villains !
i will grind your bones to dust and with your blood and it i make a paste , and of the paste a coffin i will rear and make two pasties of your shameful heads , and bid that strumpet , your unhallow dam , like to the earth swallow her own increase .
this is the feast that i have bid her to , and this the banquet she shall surfeit on , for worse than philomel you used my daughter , and worse than progne i will be revenged and now prepare your throats .
lavinia , come , he cuts their throats receive the blood and when that they are dead , let me go grind their bones to powder small and with this hateful liquor temper it , and in that paste let their vile heads be baked .
come , come , be every one officious to make this banquet , which i wish may prove more stern and bloody than the centaurs ' feast .
so , now bring them in , for i play the cook , and see them ready their mother comes .
exeunt , bearing the dead bodies scene iii .
court of titus house .
a banquet set out .
enter lucius , marcus , and goths , with aaron prisoner uncle marcus , since it is my father mind that i repair to rome , i am content .
and ours with thine , befall what fortune will .
good uncle , take you in this barbarous moor , this ravenous tiger , this accursed devil , let him receive no sustenance , fetter him till he be brought unto the empress ' face , for testimony of her foul proceedings and see the ambush of our friends be strong , i fear the emperor means no good to us .
some devil whisper curses in mine ear , and prompt me , that my tongue may utter forth the venomous malice of my swelling heart !
away , inhuman dog !
unhallow slave !
sirs , help our uncle to convey him in .
exeunt goths , with aaron .
flourish within the trumpets show the emperor is at hand .
enter saturninus and tamora , with aemilius , tribunes , senators , and others what , hath the firmament more suns than one ?
what boots it thee to call thyself a sun ?
rome emperor , and nephew , break the parle , these quarrels must be quietly debated .
the feast is ready , which the careful titus hath ordain to an honourable end , for peace , for love , for league , and good to rome please you , therefore , draw nigh , and take your places .
marcus , we will .
hautboys sound .
the company sit down at table enter titus dressed like a cook , lavinia veiled , young lucius , and others .
titus places the dishes on the table welcome , my gracious lord , welcome , dread queen , welcome , ye warlike goths , welcome , lucius , and welcome , all although the cheer be poor , fill your stomachs , please you eat of it .
why art thou thus attired , andronicus ?
because i would be sure to have all well , to entertain your highness and your empress .
we are beholding to you , good andronicus .
an if your highness knew my heart , you were .
my lord the emperor , resolve me this was it well done of rash virginius to slay his daughter with his own right hand , because she was enforced , stain , and deflower ?
it was , andronicus .
your reason , mighty lord ?
because the girl should not survive her shame , and by her presence still renew his sorrows .
a reason mighty , strong , and effectual , a pattern , precedent , and lively warrant , for me , most wretched , to perform the like .
die , die , lavinia , and thy shame with thee , kills lavinia and , with thy shame , thy father sorrow die !
what hast thou done , unnatural and unkind ?
kill her , for whom my tears have made me blind .
i am as woful as virginius was , and have a thousand times more cause than he to do this outrage and it now is done .
what , was she ravish ?
tell who did the deed .
please you eat ?
please your highness feed ?
why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus ?
not i , was chiron and demetrius they ravish her , and cut away her tongue , and they , was they , that did her all this wrong .
go fetch them hither to us presently .
why , there they are both , baked in that pie , whereof their mother daintily hath fed , eating the flesh that she herself hath bred .
is true , is true , witness my knife sharp point .
kills tamora die , frantic wretch , for this accursed deed !
kills titus can the son eye behold his father bleed ?
there meed for meed , death for a deadly deed !
kills saturninus .
a great tumult .
lucius , marcus , and others go up into the balcony you men , people and sons of rome , by uproar sever , like a flight of fowl scatter by winds and high tempestuous gusts , o , let me teach you how to knit again this scatter corn into one mutual sheaf , these broken limbs again into one body , lest rome herself be bane unto herself , and she whom mighty kingdoms to , like a forlorn and desperate castaway , do shameful execution on herself .
but if my frosty signs and chaps of age , grave witnesses of true experience , can not induce you to attend my words , to lucius speak , rome dear friend , as erst our ancestor , when with his solemn tongue he did discourse to dido sad attending ear the story of that baleful burning night when subtle greeks surprised king priam troy , tell us what sinon hath bewitch our ears , or who hath brought the fatal engine in that gives our troy , our rome , the civil wound .
my heart is not compact of flint nor steel , nor can i utter all our bitter grief , but floods of tears will drown my oratory , and break my utterance , even in the time when it should move you to attend me most , lending your kind commiseration .
here is a captain , let him tell the tale , your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak .
then , noble auditory , be it known to you , that cursed chiron and demetrius were they that murdered our emperor brother , and they it were that ravished our sister for their fell faults our brothers were beheaded , our father tears despised , and basely cozen of that true hand that fought rome quarrel out , and sent her enemies unto the grave .
lastly , myself unkindly banished , the gates shut on me , and turn weeping out , to beg relief among rome enemies who drown their enmity in my true tears .
and oped their arms to embrace me as a friend .
i am the turned forth , be it known to you , that have preserved her welfare in my blood , and from her bosom took the enemy point , sheathing the steel in my adventurous body .
alas , you know i am no vaunter , i , my scars can witness , dumb although they are , that my report is just and full of truth .
but , soft !
methinks i do digress too much , citing my worthless praise o , pardon me , for when no friends are by , men praise themselves .
now is my turn to speak .
behold this child pointing to the child in the arms of an attendant of this was tamora delivered , the issue of an irreligious moor , chief architect and plotter of these woes the villain is alive in titus ' house , and as he is , to witness this is true .
now judge what cause had titus to revenge these wrongs , unspeakable , past patience , or more than any living man could bear .
now you have heard the truth , what say you , romans ?
have we done aught amiss , show us wherein , and , from the place where you behold us now , the poor remainder of andronici will , hand in hand , all headlong cast us down .
and on the ragged stones beat forth our brains , and make a mutual closure of our house .
speak , romans , speak , and if you say we shall , lo , hand in hand , lucius and i will fall .
come , come , thou reverend man of rome , and bring our emperor gently in thy hand , lucius our emperor , for well i know the common voice do cry it shall be so .
lucius , all hail , rome royal emperor !
go , go into old titus ' sorrowful house , to attendants and hither hale that misbelieving moor , to be adjudged some direful slaughtering death , as punishment for his most wicked life .
exeunt attendants lucius , marcus , and the others descend lucius , all hail , rome gracious governor !
thanks , gentle romans may i govern so , to heal rome harms , and wipe away her woe !
but , gentle people , give me aim awhile , for nature puts me to a heavy task stand all aloof but , uncle , draw you near , to shed obsequious tears upon this trunk .
o , take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips , kissing titus these sorrowful drops upon thy face , the last true duties of thy noble son !
tear for tear , and loving kiss for kiss , thy brother marcus tenders on thy lips o were the sum of these that i should pay countless and infinite , yet would i pay them !
come hither , boy , come , come , and learn of us to melt in showers thy grandsire loved thee well many a time he danced thee on his knee , sung thee asleep , his loving breast thy pillow many a matter hath he told to thee , meet and agreeing with thine infancy , in that respect , then , like a loving child , shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring , because kind nature doth require it so friends should associate friends in grief and woe bid him farewell , commit him to the grave , do him that kindness , and take leave of him .
o grandsire , grandsire !
even with all my heart would i were dead , so you did live again !
o lord , i can not speak to him for weeping , my tears will choke me , if i ope my mouth .
attendants with aaron you sad andronici , have done with woes give sentence on this execrable wretch , that hath been breeder of these dire events .
set him in earth , and famish him , there let him stand , and rave , and cry for food , if any one relieves or pities him , for the offence he dies .
this is our doom some stay to see him fasten in the earth .
o , why should wrath be mute , and fury dumb ?
i am no baby , i , that with base prayers i should repent the evils i have done ten thousand worse than ever yet i did would i perform , if i might have my will , if one good deed in all my life i did , i do repent it from my very soul .
some loving friends convey the emperor hence , and give him burial in his father grave my father and lavinia shall forthwith be closed in our household monument .
as for that heinous tiger , tamora , no funeral rite , nor man m mourning weeds , no mournful bell shall ring her burial , but throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey her life was , and devoid of pity , and , being so , shall have like want of pity .
see justice done on aaron , that damn moor , by whom our heavy haps had their beginning then , afterwards , to order well the state , that like events may it ruinate .
exeunt act i prologue in troy , there lies the scene .
from isles of greece the princes orgulous , their high blood chafed , have to the port of athens sent their ships , fraught with the ministers and instruments of cruel war sixty and nine , that wore their crownets regal , from the athenian bay put forth toward phrygia , and their vow is made to ransack troy , within whose strong immures the ravish helen , menelaus ' queen , with wanton paris sleeps , and that the quarrel .
to tenedos they come , and the barks do there disgorge their warlike fraughtage now on dardan plains the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch their brave pavilions priam city , dardan , and tymbria , helias , chetas , troien , and antenorides , with massy staples and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts , sperr up the sons of troy .
now expectation , tickling skittish spirits , on one and other side , trojan and greek , sets all on hazard and hither am i come a prologue arm , but not in confidence of author pen or actor voice , but suited in like conditions as our argument , to tell you , fair beholders , that our play leaps the vaunt and firstlings of those broils , beginning in the middle , starting thence away to what may be digested in a play .
like or find fault , do as your pleasures are now good or bad , is but the chance of war .
scene i .
troy .
before priam palace .
enter troilus armed , and pandarus call here my varlet , i unarm again why should i war without the walls of troy , that find such cruel battle here within ?
each trojan that is master of his heart , let him to field , troilus , alas !
hath none .
will this gear be mended ?
the greeks are strong and skilful to their strength , fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant , but i am weaker than a woman tear , tamer than sleep , fonder than ignorance , less valiant than the virgin in the night and skilless as unpractised infancy .
well , i have told you enough of this for my part , i not meddle nor make no further .
he that will have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding .
have i not tarried ?
ay , the grinding , but you must tarry the bolting .
have i not tarried ?
ay , the bolting , but you must tarry the leavening .
still have i tarried .
ay , to the leavening , but here yet in the word ' the kneading , the making of the cake , the heating of the oven and the baking , nay , you must stay the cooling too , or you may chance to burn your lips .
patience herself , what goddess she be , doth lesser blench at sufferance than i do .
at priam royal table do i sit , and when fair cressid comes into my thoughts , so , traitor !
she comes ! '
when is she thence ?
well , she looked yesternight fairer than ever i saw her look , or any woman else .
i was about to tell thee when my heart , as wedged with a sigh , would rive in twain , lest hector or my father should perceive me , i have , as when the sun doth light a storm , buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile but sorrow , that is couch in seeming gladness , is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness .
an her hair were not somewhat darker than helen well , go to there were no more comparison between the women but , for my part , she is my kinswoman , i would not , as they term it , praise her but i would somebody had heard her talk yesterday , as i did .
i will not dispraise your sister cassandra wit , but o pandarus !
i tell thee , pandarus , when i do tell thee , there my hopes lie drown , reply not in how many fathoms deep they lie indrench .
i tell thee i am mad in cressid love thou is fair , ' in the open ulcer of my heart her eyes , her hair , her cheek , her gait , her voice , handlest in thy discourse , o , that her hand , in whose comparison all whites are ink , writing their own reproach , to whose soft seizure the cygnet down is harsh and spirit of sense hard as the palm of ploughman this thou me , as true thou me , when i say i love her , but , saying thus , instead of oil and balm , thou in every gash that love hath given me the knife that made it .
i speak no more than truth .
thou dost not speak so much .
faith , i not meddle i .
let her be as she is if she be fair , is the better for her , an she be not , she has the mends in her own hands .
good pandarus , how now , pandarus !
i have had my labour for my travail , on of her and on of you , gone between and between , but small thanks for my labour .
what , art thou angry , pandarus ?
what , with me ?
because she kin to me , therefore she not so fair as helen an she were not kin to me , she would be as fair on friday as helen is on sunday .
but what care i ?
i care not an she were a , is all one to me .
say i she is not fair ?
i do not care whether you do or no .
she a fool to stay behind her father , let her to the greeks , and so i tell her the next time i see her for my part , i meddle nor make no more i ' the matter .
pandarus , not i .
sweet pandarus , pray you , speak no more to me i will leave all as i found it , and there an end .
exit pandarus .
an alarum peace , you ungracious clamours !
peace , rude sounds !
fools on both sides !
helen must needs be fair , when with your blood you daily paint her thus .
i can not fight upon this argument , it is too starved a subject for my sword .
but pandarus , o gods , how do you plague me !
i can not come to cressid but by pandar , and he as tetchy to be woo to woo .
as she is against all suit .
tell me , apollo , for thy daphne love , what cressid is , what pandar , and what we ?
her bed is india , there she lies , a pearl between our ilium and where she resides , let it be call the wild and wandering flood , ourself the merchant , and this sailing pandar our doubtful hope , our convoy and our bark .
alarum .
enter aeneas how now , prince troilus !
wherefore not afield ?
because not there this woman answer sorts , for womanish it is to be from thence .
what news , aeneas , from the field ?
that paris is returned home and hurt .
by whom , aeneas ?
troilus , by menelaus .
let paris bleed , is but a scar to scorn , paris is gored with menelaus ' horn .
alarum hark , what good sport is out of town !
better at home , if i might ' were . '
but to the sport abroad are you bound thither ?
in all swift haste .
come , go we then together .
exeunt scene ii .
the same .
a street .
enter cressida and alexander who were those went by ?
queen hecuba and helen .
and whither go they ?
up to the eastern tower , whose height commands as subject all the vale , to see the battle .
hector , whose patience is , as a virtue , fix , was moved he chid andromache and struck his armourer , and , like as there were husbandry in war , before the sun rose he was harness light , and to the field goes he , where every flower did , as a prophet , weep what it foresaw in hector wrath .
what was his cause of anger ?
the noise goes , this there is among the greeks a lord of trojan blood , nephew to hector , they call him ajax .
good , and what of him ?
they say he is a very man per se , and stands alone .
so do all men , unless they are drunk , sick , or have no legs .
this man , lady , hath robbed many beasts of their particular additions , he is as valiant as the lion , churlish as the bear , slow as the elephant a man into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his valour is crushed into folly , his folly sauced with discretion there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a glimpse of , nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of it he is melancholy without cause , and merry against the hair he hath the joints of every thing , but everything so out of joint that he is a gouty briareus , many hands and no use , or purblind argus , all eyes and no sight .
but how should this man , that makes me smile , make hector angry ?
they say he yesterday coped hector in the battle and struck him down , the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since kept hector fasting and waking .
who comes here ?
madam , your uncle pandarus .
enter pandarus hector a gallant man .
as may be in the world , lady .
what that ?
what that ?
good morrow , uncle pandarus .
good morrow , cousin cressid what do you talk of ?
good morrow , alexander .
how do you , cousin ?
when were you at ilium ?
this morning , uncle .
what were you talking of when i came ?
was hector armed and gone ere ye came to ilium ?
helen was not up , was she ?
hector was gone , but helen was not up .
even so hector was stirring early .
that were we talking of , and of his anger .
was he angry ?
so he says here .
true , he was so i know the cause too he lay about him , i can tell them that and there troilus will not come far behind him let them take heed of troilus , i can tell them that too .
what , is he angry too ?
who , troilus ?
troilus is the better man of the two .
o jupiter !
there no comparison .
what , not between troilus and hector ?
do you know a man if you see him ?
ay , if i ever saw him before and knew him .
well , i say troilus is troilus .
then you say as i say , for , i am sure , he is not hector .
no , nor hector is not troilus in some degrees .
is just to each of them , he is himself .
himself !
alas , poor troilus !
i would he were .
so he is .
condition , i had gone barefoot to india .
he is not hector .
himself !
no , he not himself would a ' were himself !
well , the gods are above , time must friend or end well , troilus , well i would my heart were in her body .
no , hector is not a better man than troilus .
excuse me .
he is elder .
pardon me , pardon me .
th ' other not come , you shall tell me another tale , when th ' other come .
hector shall not have his wit this year .
he shall not need it , if he have his own .
nor his qualities .
no matter .
nor his beauty .
not become him , his own better .
you have no judgment , niece helen herself swore th ' other day , that troilus , for a brown favour for so is , i must confess , not brown neither , no , but brown .
, to say truth , brown and not brown .
to say the truth , true and not true .
she praised his complexion above paris .
why , paris hath colour enough .
so he has .
then troilus should have too much if she praised him above , his complexion is higher than his , he having colour enough , and the other higher , is too flaming a praise for a good complexion .
i had as lief helen golden tongue had commended troilus for a copper nose .
i swear to you .
i think helen loves him better than paris .
then she a merry greek indeed .
nay , i am sure she does .
she came to him th ' other day into the compassed window , and , you know , he has not past three or four hairs on his chin , indeed , a tapster arithmetic may soon bring his particulars therein to a total .
why , he is very young and yet will he , within three pound , lift as much as his brother hector .
is he so young a man and so old a lifter ?
but to prove to you that helen loves him she came and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin juno have mercy !
how came it cloven ?
why , you know is dimpled i think his smiling becomes him better than any man in all phrygia .
o , he smiles valiantly .
does he not ?
o yes , an a cloud in autumn .
why , go to , then but to prove to you that helen loves troilus , troilus will stand to the proof , if you prove it so .
troilus !
why , he esteems her no more than i esteem an addle egg .
if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle head , you would eat chickens i ' the shell .
i can not choose but laugh , to think how she tickled his chin indeed , she has a marvellous white hand , i must needs confess , without the rack .
and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin .
alas , poor chin !
many a wart is richer .
but there was such laughing !
queen hecuba laughed that her eyes ran .
with .
and cassandra laughed .
but there was more temperate fire under the pot of her eyes did her eyes run too ?
and hector laughed .
at what was all this laughing ?
marry , at the white hair that helen spied on troilus ' chin .
a had been a green hair , i should have laughed too .
they laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer .
what was his answer ?
quoth she , but two and fifty hairs on your chin , and one of them is white .
this is her question .
that true , make no question of that .
and fifty hairs ' quoth he , one white that white hair is my father , and all the rest are his sons . '
! '
quoth she , of these hairs is paris , my husband ?
forked one , ' quoth he , out , and give it him . '
but there was such laughing !
and helen so blushed , an paris so chafed , and all the rest so laughed , that it passed .
so let it now , for it has been while going by .
well , cousin .
i told you a thing yesterday , think o .
so i do .
i be sworn is true , he will weep you , an a man born in april .
and i spring up in his tears , an a nettle against may .
a retreat sounded hark !
they are coming from the field shall we stand up here , and see them as they pass toward ilium ?
good niece , do , sweet niece cressida .
at your pleasure .
here , here , here an excellent place , here we may see most bravely i tell you them all by their names as they pass by , but mark troilus above the rest .
speak not so loud .
aeneas passes that aeneas is not that a brave man ?
he one of the flowers of troy , i can tell you but mark troilus , you shall see anon .
antenor passes who that ?
that antenor he has a shrewd wit , i can tell you , and he a man good enough , he one o ' the soundest judgments in whosoever , and a proper man of person .
when comes troilus ?
i show you troilus anon if he see me , you shall see him nod at me .
will he give you the nod ?
you shall see .
if he do , the rich shall have more .
hector passes that hector , that , that , look you , that , there a fellow !
go thy way , hector !
there a brave man , niece .
o brave hector !
look how he looks !
there a countenance !
not a brave man ?
o , a brave man !
is a ' not ?
it does a man heart good .
look you what hacks are on his helmet !
look you yonder , do you see ?
look you there there no jesting , there laying on , off who will , as they say there be hacks !
be those with swords ?
swords !
any thing , he cares not , an the devil come to him , it all one by god lid , it does one heart good .
yonder comes paris , yonder comes paris .
paris passes look ye yonder , niece , not a gallant man too , not ?
why , this is brave now .
who said he came hurt home ?
he not hurt why , this will do helen heart good now , ha !
would i could see troilus now !
you shall see troilus anon .
helenus passes who that ?
that helenus .
i marvel where troilus is .
that helenus .
i think he went not forth .
that helenus .
can helenus fight , uncle ?
helenus ?
no .
yes , he fight indifferent well .
i marvel where troilus is .
hark !
do you not hear the people cry ' ?
helenus is a priest .
what sneaking fellow comes yonder ?
troilus passes where ?
yonder ?
that deiphobus .
is troilus !
there a man , niece !
hem !
brave troilus !
the prince of chivalry !
peace , for shame , peace !
mark him , note him .
o brave troilus !
look well upon him , niece look you how his sword is bloodied , and his helm more hacked than hector , and how he looks , and how he goes !
o admirable youth !
he saw three and twenty .
go thy way , troilus , go thy way !
had i a sister were a grace , or a daughter a goddess , he should take his choice .
o admirable man !
paris ?
paris is dirt to him , and , i warrant , helen , to change , would give an eye to boot .
here come more .
forces pass asses , fools , dolts !
chaff and bran , chaff and bran !
porridge after meat !
i could live and die i ' the eyes of troilus .
look , look the eagles are gone crows and daws , crows and daws !
i had rather be such a man as troilus than agamemnon and all greece .
there is among the greeks achilles , a better man than troilus .
achilles !
a drayman , a porter , a very camel .
well , well .
, well ! '
why , have you any discretion ?
have you any eyes ?
do you know what a man is ?
is not birth , beauty , good shape , discourse , manhood , learning , gentleness , virtue , youth , liberality , and such like , the spice and salt that season a man ?
ay , a minced man and then to be baked with no date in the pie , for then the man date out .
you are such a woman !
one knows not at what ward you lie .
upon my back , to defend my belly , upon my wit , to defend my wiles , upon my secrecy , to defend mine honesty , my mask , to defend my beauty , and you , to defend all these and at all these wards i lie , at a thousand watches .
say one of your watches .
nay , i watch you for that , and that one of the chiefest of them too if i can not ward what i would not have hit , i can watch you for telling how i took the blow , unless it swell past hiding , and then it past watching .
you are such another !
enter troilus boy sir , my lord would instantly speak with you .
where ?
at your own house , there he unarms him .
good boy , tell him i come .
exit boy i doubt he be hurt .
fare ye well , good niece .
adieu , uncle .
i be with you , niece , by and by .
to bring , uncle ?
ay , a token from troilus .
by the same token , you are a bawd .
exit pandarus words , vows , gifts , tears , and love full sacrifice , he offers in another enterprise , but more in troilus thousand fold i see than in the glass of pandar praise may be , yet hold i off .
women are angels , wooing things won are done , joy soul lies in the doing .
that she beloved knows nought that knows not this men prize the thing ungain more than it is that she was never yet that ever knew love got so sweet as when desire did sue .
therefore this maxim out of love i teach achievement is command , ungain , beseech then though my heart content firm love doth bear , nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear .
exeunt scene iii .
the grecian camp .
before agamemnon tent .
sennet .
enter agamemnon , nestor , ulysses , menelaus , and others princes , what grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks ?
the ample proposition that hope makes in all designs begun on earth below fails in the promised largeness cheques and disasters grow in the veins of actions highest rear , as knots , by the conflux of meeting sap , infect the sound pine and divert his grain tortive and errant from his course of growth .
nor , princes , is it matter new to us that we come short of our suppose so far that after seven years ' siege yet troy walls stand , sith every action that hath gone before , whereof we have record , trial did draw bias and thwart , not answering the aim , and that unbodied figure of the thought that surmised shape .
why then , you princes , do you with cheeks abash behold our works , and call them shames ?
which are indeed nought else but the protractive trials of great jove to find persistive constancy in men the fineness of which metal is not found in fortune love , for then the bold and coward , the wise and fool , the artist and unread , the hard and soft seem all affined and kin but , in the wind and tempest of her frown , distinction , with a broad and powerful fan , puffing at all , winnows the light away , and what hath mass or matter , by itself lies rich in virtue and unmingled .
with due observance of thy godlike seat , great agamemnon , nestor shall apply thy latest words .
in the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men the sea being smooth , how many shallow bauble boats dare sail upon her patient breast , making their way with those of nobler bulk !
but let the ruffian boreas once enrage the gentle thetis , and anon behold the bark through liquid mountains cut , bounding between the two moist elements , like perseus ' horse where then the saucy boat whose weak untimber sides but even now greatness ?
either to harbour fled , or made a toast for neptune .
even so doth valour show and valour worth divide in storms of fortune , for in her ray and brightness the herd hath more annoyance by the breeze than by the tiger , but when the splitting wind makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks , and flies fled under shade , why , then the thing of courage as roused with rage with rage doth sympathize , and with an accent tuned in selfsame key retorts to chiding fortune .
agamemnon , thou great commander , nerve and bone of greece , heart of our numbers , soul and only spirit .
in whom the tempers and the minds of all should be shut up , hear what ulysses speaks .
besides the applause and approbation to which , to agamemnon most mighty for thy place and sway , to nestor and thou most reverend for thy life i give to both your speeches , which were such as agamemnon and the hand of greece should hold up high in brass , and such again as venerable nestor , hatch in silver , should with a bond of air , strong as the on which heaven rides , knit all the greekish ears to his experienced tongue , yet let it please both , thou great , and wise , to hear ulysses speak .
speak , prince of ithaca , and of less expect that matter needless , of importless burden , divide thy lips , than we are confident , when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws , we shall hear music , wit and oracle .
troy , yet upon his basis , had been down , and the great hector sword had lack a master , but for these instances .
the specialty of rule hath been neglected and , look , how many grecian tents do stand hollow upon this plain , so many hollow factions .
when that the general is not like the hive to whom the foragers shall all repair , what honey is expected ?
degree being vizarded , the unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask .
the heavens themselves , the planets and this centre observe degree , priority and place , insisture , course , proportion , season , form , office and custom , in all line of order , and therefore is the glorious planet sol in noble eminence enthroned and sphered amidst the other , whose medicinable eye corrects the ill aspects of planets evil , and posts , like the commandment of a king , sans cheque to good and bad but when the planets in evil mixture to disorder wander , what plagues and what portents !
what mutiny !
what raging of the sea !
shaking of earth !
commotion in the winds !
frights , changes , horrors , divert and crack , rend and deracinate the unity and married calm of states quite from their fixure !
o , when degree is shaked , which is the ladder to all high designs , then enterprise is sick !
how could communities , degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities , peaceful commerce from dividable shores , the primogenitive and due of birth , prerogative of age , crowns , sceptres , laurels , but by degree , stand in authentic place ?
take but degree away , untune that string , and , hark , what discord follows !
each thing meets in mere oppugnancy the bounded waters should lift their bosoms higher than the shores and make a sop of all this solid globe strength should be lord of imbecility , and the rude son should strike his father dead force should be right , or rather , right and wrong , between whose endless jar justice resides , should lose their names , and so should justice too .
then every thing includes itself in power , power into will , will into appetite , and appetite , an universal wolf , so doubly seconded with will and power , must make perforce an universal prey , and last eat up himself .
great agamemnon , this chaos , when degree is suffocate , follows the choking .
and this neglection of degree it is that by a pace goes backward , with a purpose it hath to climb .
the general disdain by him one step below , he by the next , that next by him beneath , so every step , exampled by the first pace that is sick of his superior , grows to an envious fever of pale and bloodless emulation and is this fever that keeps troy on foot , not her own sinews .
to end a tale of length , troy in our weakness stands , not in her strength .
most wisely hath ulysses here discover the fever whereof all our power is sick .
the nature of the sickness found , ulysses , what is the remedy ?
the great achilles , whom opinion crowns the sinew and the forehand of our host , having his ear full of his airy fame , grows dainty of his worth , and in his tent lies mocking our designs with him patroclus upon a lazy bed the livelong day breaks scurril jests , and with ridiculous and awkward action , which , slanderer , he imitation calls , he pageants us .
sometime , great agamemnon , thy topless deputation he puts on , and , like a strutting player , whose conceit lies in his hamstring , and doth think it rich to hear the wooden dialogue and sound his stretch footing and the scaffoldage , such and seeming he acts thy greatness in and when he speaks , is like a chime , with terms unsquared , which , from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp would seem hyperboles .
at this fusty stuff the large achilles , on his press bed lolling , from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause , cries !
is agamemnon just .
now play me nestor , hem , and stroke thy beard , as he being drest to some oration . '
that done , as near as the extremest ends of parallels , as like as vulcan and his wife yet god achilles still cries !
is nestor right .
now play him me , patroclus , arming to answer in a night alarm . '
and then , forsooth , the faint defects of age must be the scene of mirth , to cough and spit , and , with a on his gorget , shake in and out the rivet and at this sport sir valour dies , cries ' o , enough , patroclus , or give me ribs of steel !
i shall split all in pleasure of my spleen . '
and in this fashion , all our abilities , gifts , natures , shapes , severals and generals of grace exact , achievements , plots , orders , preventions , excitements to the field , or speech for truce , success or loss , what is or is not , serves as stuff for these two to make paradoxes .
and in the imitation of these twain who , as ulysses says , opinion crowns with an imperial voice many are infect .
ajax is grown , and bears his head in such a rein , in full as proud a place as broad achilles , keeps his tent like him , makes factious feasts , rails on our state of war , bold as an oracle , and sets thersites , a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint , to match us in comparisons with dirt , to weaken and discredit our exposure , how rank soever rounded in with danger .
they tax our policy , and call it cowardice , count wisdom as no member of the war , forestall prescience , and esteem no act but that of hand the still and mental parts , that do contrive how many hands shall strike , when fitness calls them on , and know by measure of their observant toil the enemies ' weight , why , this hath not a finger dignity they call this , mappery , , so that the ram that batters down the wall , for the great swing and rudeness of his poise , they place before his hand that made the engine , or those that with the fineness of their souls by reason guide his execution .
let this be granted , and achilles ' horse makes many thetis ' sons .
a tucket what trumpet ?
look , menelaus .
from troy .
enter aeneas what would you our tent ?
is this great agamemnon tent , i pray you ?
even this .
may one , that is a herald and a prince , do a fair message to his kingly ears ?
with surety stronger than achilles ' arm all the greekish heads , which with one voice call agamemnon head and general .
fair leave and large security .
how may a stranger to those most imperial looks know them from eyes of other mortals ?
how !
ay , i ask , that i might waken reverence , and bid the cheek be ready with a blush modest as morning when she coldly eyes the youthful phoebus which is that god in office , guiding men ?
which is the high and mighty agamemnon ?
this trojan scorns us , or the men of troy are ceremonious courtiers .
courtiers as free , as debonair , unarm , as bending angels , that their fame in peace but when they would seem soldiers , they have galls , good arms , strong joints , true swords , and , jove accord , nothing so full of heart .
but peace , aeneas , peace , trojan , lay thy finger on thy lips !
the worthiness of praise distains his worth , if that the praised himself bring the praise forth but what the repining enemy commends , that breath fame blows , that praise , sole sure , transcends .
sir , you of troy , call you yourself aeneas ?
ay , greek , that is my name .
what your affair i pray you ?
sir , pardon , is for agamemnon ears .
he hears naught privately that comes from troy .
nor i from troy come not to whisper him i bring a trumpet to awake his ear , to set his sense on the attentive bent , and then to speak .
speak frankly as the wind , it is not agamemnon sleeping hour that thou shalt know .
trojan , he is awake , he tells thee so himself .
trumpet , blow loud , send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents , and every greek of mettle , let him know , what troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud .
trumpet sounds we have , great agamemnon , here in troy a prince call hector , priam is his father , who in this dull and truce is rusty grown he bade me take a trumpet , and to this purpose speak .
kings , princes , lords !
if there be one among the of greece that holds his honour higher than his ease , that seeks his praise more than he fears his peril , that knows his valour , and knows not his fear , that loves his mistress more than in confession , with truant vows to her own lips he loves , and dare avow her beauty and her worth in other arms than hers , to him this challenge .
hector , in view of trojans and of greeks , shall make it good , or do his best to do it , he hath a lady , wiser , fairer , truer , than ever greek did compass in his arms , and will with his trumpet call midway between your tents and walls of troy , to rouse a grecian that is true in love if any come , hector shall honour him , if none , he say in troy when he retires , the grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth the splinter of a lance .
even so much .
this shall be told our lovers , lord aeneas , if none of them have soul in such a kind , we left them all at home but we are soldiers , and may that soldier a mere recreant prove , that means not , hath not , or is not in love !
if then one is , or hath , or means to be , that one meets hector , if none else , i am he .
tell him of nestor , one that was a man when hector grandsire suck he is old now , but if there be not in our grecian host one noble man that hath one spark of fire , to answer for his love , tell him from me i hide my silver beard in a gold beaver and in my vantbrace put this wither brawn , and meeting him will tell him that my lady was fairer than his grandam and as chaste as may be in the world his youth in flood , i prove this truth with my three drops of blood .
now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth !
amen .
fair lord aeneas , let me touch your hand , to our pavilion shall i lead you , sir .
achilles shall have word of this intent , so shall each lord of greece , from tent to tent yourself shall feast with us before you go and find the welcome of a noble foe .
exeunt all but ulysses and nestor nestor !
what says ulysses ?
i have a young conception in my brain , be you my time to bring it to some shape .
what ?
this is blunt wedges rive hard knots the seeded pride that hath to this maturity blown up in rank achilles must or now be cropp , or , shedding , breed a nursery of like evil , to overbulk us all .
well , and how ?
this challenge that the gallant hector sends , however it is spread in general name , relates in purpose only to achilles .
the purpose is perspicuous even as substance , whose grossness little characters sum up and , in the publication , make no strain , but that achilles , were his brain as barren as banks of libya , though , apollo knows , is dry enough , will , with great speed of judgment , ay , with celerity , find hector purpose pointing on him .
and wake him to the answer , think you ?
yes , is most meet whom may you else oppose , that can from hector bring his honour off , if not achilles ?
be a sportful combat , yet in the trial much opinion dwells , for here the trojans taste our repute with their finest palate and trust to me , ulysses , our imputation shall be oddly poised in this wild action , for the success , although particular , shall give a scantling of good or bad unto the general , and in such indexes , although small pricks to their subsequent volumes , there is seen the baby figure of the giant mass of things to come at large .
it is supposed he that meets hector issues from our choice and choice , being mutual act of all our souls , makes merit her election , and doth boil , as from us all , a man distill out of our virtues , who miscarrying , what heart receives from hence the conquering part , to steel a strong opinion to themselves ?
which entertain , limbs are his instruments , in no less working than are swords and bows directive by the limbs .
give pardon to my speech therefore is meet achilles meet not hector .
let us , like merchants , show our foulest wares , and think , perchance , they sell , if not , the lustre of the better yet to show , shall show the better .
do not consent that ever hector and achilles meet , for both our honour and our shame in this are dogg with two strange followers .
i see them not with my old eyes what are they ?
what glory our achilles shares from hector , were he not proud , we all should share with him but he already is too insolent , a nd we were better parch in afric sun than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes , should he hector fair if he were foil , why then , we did our main opinion crush in taint of our best man .
no , make a lottery , and , by device , let blockish ajax draw the sort to fight with hector among ourselves give him allowance for the better man , for that will physic the great myrmidon who broils in loud applause , and make him fall his crest that prouder than blue iris bends .
if the dull brainless ajax come safe off , we dress him up in voices if he fail , yet go we under our opinion still that we have better men .
but , hit or miss , our project life this shape of sense assumes ajax employ plucks down achilles ' plumes .
ulysses , now i begin to relish thy advice , and i will give a taste of it forthwith to agamemnon go we to him straight .
two curs shall tame each other pride alone must tarre the mastiffs on , as their bone .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a part of the grecian camp .
enter ajax and thersites thersites !
agamemnon , how if he had boils ?
full , all over , generally ?
thersites !
and those boils did run ?
say so did not the general run then ?
were not that a botchy core ?
dog !
then would come some matter from him , i see none now .
thou son , canst thou not hear ?
beating him feel , then .
the plague of greece upon thee , thou mongrel lord !
speak then , thou vinewedst leaven , speak i will beat thee into handsomeness .
i shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness but , i think , thy horse will sooner con an oration than thou learn a prayer without book .
thou canst strike , canst thou ?
a red murrain o ' thy jade tricks !
toadstool , learn me the proclamation .
dost thou think i have no sense , thou strikest me thus ?
the proclamation !
thou art proclaimed a fool , i think .
do not , porpentine , do not my fingers itch .
i would thou didst itch from head to foot and i had the scratching of thee , i would make thee the loathsomest scab in greece .
when thou art forth in the incursions , thou strikest as slow as another .
i say , the proclamation !
thou grumblest and railest every hour on achilles , and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as cerberus is at proserpine beauty , ay , that thou barkest at him .
mistress thersites !
thou shouldest strike him .
cobloaf !
he would pun thee into shivers with his fist , as a sailor breaks a biscuit .
beating him you whoreson cur !
do , do .
thou stool for a witch !
ay , do , do , thou lord !
thou hast no more brain than i have in mine elbows , an assinego may tutor thee thou ass !
thou art here but to thrash trojans , and thou art bought and sold among those of any wit , like a barbarian slave .
if thou use to beat me , i will begin at thy heel , and tell what thou art by inches , thou thing of no bowels , thou !
you dog !
you scurvy lord !
beating him you cur !
mars his idiot !
do , rudeness , do , camel , do , do .
enter achilles and patroclus why , how now , ajax !
wherefore do you thus ?
how now , thersites !
what the matter , man ?
you see him there , do you ?
ay , what the matter ?
nay , look upon him .
so i do what the matter ?
nay , but regard him well .
! '
why , i do so .
but yet you look not well upon him , for whosoever you take him to be , he is ajax .
i know that , fool .
ay , but that fool knows not himself .
therefore i beat thee .
lo , lo , lo , lo , what modicums of wit he utters !
his evasions have ears thus long .
i have bobbed his brain more than he has beat my bones i will buy nine sparrows for a penny , and his pia mater is not worth the nineth part of a sparrow .
this lord , achilles , ajax , who wears his wit in his belly and his guts in his head , i tell you what i say of him .
what ?
i say , this ajax ajax offers to beat him nay , good ajax .
has not so much wit nay , i must hold you .
as will stop the eye of helen needle , for whom he comes to fight .
peace , fool !
i would have peace and quietness , but the fool will not he there that he look you there .
o thou damned cur !
i shall will you set your wit to a fool ?
no , i warrant you , for a fools will shame it .
good words , thersites .
what the quarrel ?
i bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the proclamation , and he rails upon me .
i serve thee not .
well , go to , go to .
i serve here voluntarily .
your last service was sufferance , was not voluntary no man is beaten voluntary ajax was here the voluntary , and you as under an impress .
so , a great deal of your wit , too , lies in your sinews , or else there be liars .
hector have a great catch , if he knock out either of your brains a ' were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel .
what , with me too , thersites ?
there ulysses and old nestor , whose wit was mouldy ere your grandsires had nails on their toes , yoke you like and make you plough up the wars .
what , what ?
yes , good sooth to , achilles !
to , ajax !
to !
i shall cut out your tongue .
is no matter !
i shall speak as much as thou afterwards .
no more words , thersites , peace !
i will hold my peace when achilles ' brach bids me , shall i ?
there for you , patroclus .
i will see you hanged , like clotpoles , ere i come any more to your tents i will keep where there is wit stirring and leave the faction of fools .
exit a good riddance .
marry , this , sir , is proclaim through all our host that hector , by the fifth hour of the sun , will with a trumpet our tents and troy morning call some knight to arms that hath a stomach , and such a one that dare maintain i know not what is trash .
farewell .
farewell .
who shall answer him ?
i know not is put to lottery , otherwise he knew his man .
o , meaning you .
i will go learn more of it .
exeunt scene ii .
troy .
a room in priam palace .
enter priam , hector , troilus , paris , and helenus after so many hours , lives , speeches spent , thus once again says nestor from the greeks helen , and all damage else as honour , loss of time , travail , expense , wounds , friends , and what else dear that is consumed in hot digestion of this cormorant war shall be struck off . '
hector , what say you ?
though no man lesser fears the greeks than i as far as toucheth my particular , yet , dread priam , there is no lady of more softer bowels , more spongy to suck in the sense of fear , more ready to cry out knows what follows ? '
than hector is the wound of peace is surety , surety secure , but modest doubt is call the beacon of the wise , the tent that searches to the bottom of the worst .
let helen go since the first sword was drawn about this question , every tithe soul , many thousand dismes , hath been as dear as helen , i mean , of ours if we have lost so many tenths of ours , to guard a thing not ours nor worth to us , had it our name , the value of one ten , what merit in that reason which denies the yielding of her up ?
fie , fie , my brother !
weigh you the worth and honour of a king so great as our dread father in a scale of common ounces ?
will you with counters sum the past proportion of his infinite ?
and buckle in a waist most fathomless with spans and inches so diminutive as fears and reasons ?
fie , for godly shame !
no marvel , though you bite so sharp at reasons , you are so empty of them .
should not our father bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons , because your speech hath none that tells him so ?
you are for dreams and slumbers , brother priest , you fur your gloves with reason .
here are your reasons you know an enemy intends you harm , you know a sword employ is perilous , and reason flies the object of all harm who marvels then , when helenus beholds a grecian and his sword , if he do set the very wings of reason to his heels and fly like chidden mercury from jove , or like a star disorb ?
nay , if we talk of reason , let shut our gates and sleep manhood and honour should have , would they but fat their thoughts with this cramm reason reason and respect make livers pale and lustihood deject .
brother , she is not worth what she doth cost the holding .
what is aught , but as is valued ?
but value dwells not in particular will , it holds his estimate and dignity as well wherein is precious of itself as in the prizer is mad idolatry to make the service greater than the god and the will dotes that is attributive to what infectiously itself affects , without some image of the affected merit .
i take a wife , and my election is led on in the conduct of my will , my will enkindled by mine eyes and ears , two traded pilots the dangerous shores of will and judgment how may i avoid , although my will distaste what it elected , the wife i chose ?
there can be no evasion to blench from this and to stand firm by honour we turn not back the silks upon the merchant , when we have soil them , nor the remainder viands we do not throw in unrespective sieve , because we now are full .
it was thought meet paris should do some vengeance on the greeks your breath of full consent bellied his sails , the seas and winds , old wranglers , took a truce and did him service he touch the ports desired , and for an old aunt whom the greeks held captive , he brought a grecian queen , whose youth and freshness wrinkles apollo , and makes stale the morning .
why keep we her ?
the grecians keep our aunt is she worth keeping ?
why , she is a pearl , whose price hath launch above a thousand ships , and turn crown kings to merchants .
if you avouch was wisdom paris went as you must needs , for you all cried , go , ' if you confess he brought home noble prize as you must needs , for you all clapp your hands and cried ! '
why do you now the issue of your proper wisdoms rate , and do a deed that fortune never did , beggar the estimation which you prized richer than sea and land ?
o , theft most base , that we have what we do fear to keep !
but , thieves , unworthy of a thing so , that in their country did them that disgrace , we fear to warrant in our native place !
within cry , trojans , cry !
what noise ?
what shriek is this ?
is our mad sister , i do know her voice .
within cry , trojans !
it is cassandra .
enter cassandra , raving cry , trojans , cry !
lend me ten thousand eyes , and i will fill them with prophetic tears .
peace , sister , peace !
virgins and boys , and wrinkled eld , soft infancy , that nothing canst but cry , add to my clamours !
let us pay betimes a moiety of that mass of moan to come .
cry , trojans , cry !
practise your eyes with tears !
troy must not be , nor goodly ilion stand , our firebrand brother , paris , burns us all .
cry , trojans , cry !
a helen and a woe cry , cry !
troy burns , or else let helen go .
exit now , youthful troilus , do not these high strains of divination in our sister work some touches of remorse ?
or is your blood so madly hot that no discourse of reason , nor fear of bad success in a bad cause , can qualify the same ?
why , brother hector , we may not think the justness of each act such and no other than event doth form it , nor once deject the courage of our minds , because cassandra mad her raptures can not distaste the goodness of a quarrel which hath our several honours all engaged to make it gracious .
for my private part , i am no more touch than all priam sons and jove forbid there should be done amongst us such things as might offend the weakest spleen to fight for and maintain !
else might the world convince of levity as well my undertakings as your counsels but i attest the gods , your full consent gave wings to my propension and cut off all fears attending on so dire a project .
for what , alas , can these my single arms ?
what propugnation is in one man valour , to stand the push and enmity of those this quarrel would excite ?
yet , i protest , were i alone to pass the difficulties and had as ample power as i have will , paris should retract what he hath done , nor faint in the pursuit .
paris , you speak like one besotted on your sweet delights you have the honey still , but these the gall , so to be valiant is no praise at all .
sir , i propose not merely to myself the pleasures such a beauty brings with it , but i would have the soil of her fair rape wiped off , in honourable keeping her .
what treason were it to the ransack queen , disgrace to your great worths and shame to me , now to deliver her possession up on terms of base compulsion !
can it be that so degenerate a strain as this should once set footing in your generous bosoms ?
there not the meanest spirit on our party without a heart to dare or sword to draw when helen is defended , nor none so noble whose life were ill bestow or death unfamed where helen is the subject , then , i say , well may we fight for her whom , we know well , the world large spaces can not parallel .
paris and troilus , you have both said well , and on the cause and question now in hand have glozed , but superficially not much unlike young men , whom aristotle thought unfit to hear moral philosophy the reasons you allege do more conduce to the hot passion of distemper blood than to make up a free determination right and wrong , for pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than adders to the voice of any true decision .
nature craves all dues be render to their owners now , what nearer debt in all humanity than wife is to the husband ?
if this law of nature be corrupted through affection , and that great minds , of partial indulgence to their benumbed wills , resist the same , there is a law in each nation to curb those raging appetites that are most disobedient and refractory .
if helen then be wife to sparta king , as it is known she is , these moral laws of nature and of nations speak aloud to have her back return thus to persist in doing wrong extenuates not wrong , but makes it much more heavy .
hector opinion is this in way of truth , yet , my spritely brethren , i propend to you in resolution to keep helen still , for is a cause that hath no mean dependance upon our joint and several dignities .
why , there you touch the life of our design were it not glory that we more affected than the performance of our heaving spleens , i would not wish a drop of trojan blood spent more in her defence .
but , worthy hector , she is a theme of honour and renown , a spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds , whose present courage may beat down our foes , and fame in time to come canonize us , for , i presume , brave hector would not lose so rich advantage of a promised glory as smiles upon the forehead of this action for the wide world revenue .
i am yours , you valiant offspring of great priamus .
i have a roisting challenge sent amongst the dun and factious nobles of the greeks will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits i was advertised their great general slept , whilst emulation in the army crept this , i presume , will wake him .
exeunt scene iii .
the grecian camp .
before achilles ' tent .
enter thersites , solus how now , thersites !
what lost in the labyrinth of thy fury !
shall the elephant ajax carry it thus ?
he beats me , and i rail at him o , worthy satisfaction !
would it were otherwise , that i could beat him , whilst he railed at me .
, i learn to conjure and raise devils , but i see some issue of my spiteful execrations .
then there achilles , a rare enginer !
if troy be not taken till these two undermine it , the walls will stand till they fall of themselves .
o thou great of olympus , forget that thou art jove , the king of gods and , mercury , lose all the serpentine craft of thy caduceus , if ye take not that little , little less than little wit from them that they have !
which ignorance itself knows is so abundant scarce , it will not in circumvention deliver a fly from a spider , without drawing their massy irons and cutting the web .
after this , the vengeance on the whole camp !
or rather , the !
for that , methinks , is the curse dependent on those that war for a placket .
i have said my prayers and devil envy say amen .
what ho !
my lord achilles !
enter patroclus who there ?
thersites !
good thersites , come in and rail .
if i could have remembered a gilt counterfeit , thou wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation but it is no matter , thyself upon thyself !
the common curse of mankind , folly and ignorance , be thine in great revenue !
heaven bless thee from a tutor , and discipline come not near thee !
let thy blood be thy direction till thy death !
then if she that lays thee out says thou art a fair corse , i be sworn and sworn upo she never shrouded any but lazars .
amen .
where achilles ?
what , art thou devout ?
wast thou in prayer ?
ay the heavens hear me !
enter achilles who there ?
thersites , my lord .
where , where ?
art thou come ?
why , my cheese , my digestion , why hast thou not served thyself in to my table so many meals ?
come , what agamemnon ?
thy commander , achilles .
then tell me , patroclus , what achilles ?
thy lord , thersites then tell me , i pray thee , what thyself ?
thy knower , patroclus then tell me , patroclus , what art thou ?
thou mayst tell that knowest .
o , tell , tell .
i decline the whole question .
agamemnon commands achilles , achilles is my lord , i am patroclus ' knower , and patroclus is a fool .
you rascal !
peace , fool !
i have not done .
he is a privileged man .
proceed , thersites .
agamemnon is a fool , achilles is a fool , thersites is a fool , and , as aforesaid , patroclus is a fool .
derive this , come .
agamemnon is a fool to offer to command achilles , achilles is a fool to be commanded of agamemnon , thersites is a fool to serve such a fool , and patroclus is a fool positive .
why am i a fool ?
make that demand of the prover .
it suffices me thou art .
look you , who comes here ?
patroclus , i speak with nobody .
come in with me , thersites .
exit here is such patchery , such juggling and such knavery !
all the argument is a cuckold and a whore , a good quarrel to draw emulous factions and bleed to death upon .
now , the dry serpigo on the subject !
and war and lechery confound all !
exit enter agamemnon , ulysses , nestor , diomedes , and ajax where is achilles ?
within his tent , but ill disposed , my lord .
let it be known to him that we are here .
he shent our messengers , and we lay by our appertainments , visiting of him let him be told so , lest perchance he think we dare not move the question of our place , or know not what we are .
i shall say so to him .
exit we saw him at the opening of his tent he is not sick .
yes , , sick of proud heart you may call it melancholy , if you will favour the man , but , by my head , is pride but why , why ?
let him show us the cause .
a word , my lord .
takes agamemnon aside what moves ajax thus to bay at him ?
achilles hath inveigled his fool from him .
who , thersites ?
he .
then will ajax lack matter , if he have lost his argument .
no , you see , he is his argument that has his argument , achilles .
all the better , their fraction is more our wish than their faction but it was a strong composure a fool could disunite .
the amity that wisdom knits not , folly may easily untie .
here comes patroclus .
patroclus no achilles with him .
the elephant hath joints , but none for courtesy his legs are legs for necessity , not for flexure .
achilles bids me say , he is much sorry , if any thing more than your sport and pleasure did move your greatness and this noble state to call upon him , he hopes it is no other but for your health and your digestion sake , and breath .
hear you , patroclus we are too well acquainted with these answers but his evasion , wing thus swift with scorn , can not outfly our apprehensions .
much attribute he hath , and much the reason why we ascribe it to him , yet all his virtues , not virtuously on his own part beheld , do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss , yea , like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish , are like to rot untasted .
go and tell him , we come to speak with him , and you shall not sin , if you do say we think him and , in greater than in the note of judgment , and worthier than himself here tend the savage strangeness he puts on , disguise the holy strength of their command , and underwrite in an observing kind his humorous predominance , yea , watch his pettish lunes , his ebbs , his flows , as if the passage and whole carriage of this action rode on his tide .
go tell him this , and add , that if he overhold his price so much , we none of him , but let him , like an engine not portable , lie under this report action hither , this can not go to war a stirring dwarf we do allowance give before a sleeping giant . '
tell him so .
i shall , and bring his answer presently .
exit in second voice we not be satisfied , we come to speak with him .
ulysses , enter you .
exit ulysses what is he more than another ?
no more than what he thinks he is .
is he so much ?
do you not think he thinks himself a better man than i am ?
no question .
will you subscribe his thought , and say he is ?
no , noble ajax , you are as strong , as valiant , as wise , no less noble , much more gentle , and altogether more tractable .
why should a man be proud ?
how doth pride grow ?
i know not what pride is .
your mind is the clearer , ajax , and your virtues the fairer .
he that is proud eats up himself pride is his own glass , his own trumpet , his own chronicle , and whatever praises itself but in the deed , devours the deed in the praise .
i do hate a proud man , as i hate the engendering of toads .
yet he loves himself not strange ?
aside ulysses achilles will not to the field .
what his excuse ?
he doth rely on none , but carries on the stream of his dispose without observance or respect of any , in will peculiar and in .
why will he not upon our fair request untent his person and share the air with us ?
things small as nothing , for request sake only , he makes important possess he is with greatness , and speaks not to himself but with a pride that quarrels at imagined worth holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse that his mental and his active parts kingdom achilles in commotion rages and batters down himself what should i say ?
he is so plaguy proud that the of it cry recovery . '
let ajax go to him .
dear lord , go you and greet him in his tent is said he holds you well , and will be led at your request a little from himself .
o agamemnon , let it not be so !
we consecrate the steps that ajax makes when they go from achilles shall the proud lord that bastes his arrogance with his own seam and never suffers matter of the world enter his thoughts , save such as do revolve and ruminate himself , shall he be worshipp of that we hold an idol more than he ?
no , this thrice worthy and right valiant lord must not so stale his palm , nobly acquired , nor , by my will , assubjugate his merit , as amply titled as achilles is , by going to achilles that were to enlard his fat already pride and add more coals to cancer when he burns with entertaining great hyperion .
this lord go to him !
jupiter forbid , and say in thunder go to him . '
aside to diomedes o , this is well , he rubs the vein of him .
aside to nestor and how his silence drinks up this applause !
if i go to him , with my armed fist i pash him the face .
o , no , you shall not go .
an a ' be proud with me , i pheeze his pride let me go to him .
not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel .
a paltry , insolent fellow !
how he describes himself !
can he not be sociable ?
the raven chides blackness .
i let his humours blood .
he will be the physician that should be the patient .
an all men were o ' my mind , wit would be out of fashion .
a ' should not bear it so , a ' should eat swords first shall pride carry it ?
an , carry half .
a ' would have ten shares .
i will knead him , i make him supple .
he not yet through warm force him with praises pour in , pour in , his ambition is dry .
to agamemnon my lord , you feed too much on this dislike .
our noble general , do not do so .
you must prepare to fight without achilles .
why , is this naming of him does him harm .
here is a man but is before his face , i will be silent .
wherefore should you so ?
he is not emulous , as achilles is .
know the whole world , he is as valiant .
a whoreson dog , that shall pelter thus with us !
would he were a trojan !
what a vice were it in ajax now , if he were proud , or covetous of praise , ay , or surly borne , or strange , or !
thank the heavens , lord , thou art of sweet composure , praise him that got thee , she that gave thee suck famed be thy tutor , and thy parts of nature thrice famed , beyond all erudition but he that disciplined thy arms to fight , let mars divide eternity in twain , and give him half and , for thy vigour , milo his addition yield to sinewy ajax .
i will not praise thy wisdom , which , like a bourn , a pale , a shore , confines thy spacious and dilated parts here nestor , instructed by the antiquary times , he must , he is , he can not but be wise put pardon , father nestor , were your days as green as ajax ' and your brain so temper , you should not have the eminence of him , but be as ajax .
shall i call you father ?
ay , my good son .
be ruled by him , lord ajax .
there is no tarrying here , the hart achilles keeps thicket .
please it our great general to call together all his state of war , fresh kings are come to troy we must with all our main of power stand fast and here a lord , come knights from east to west , and cull their flower , ajax shall cope the best .
go we to council .
let achilles sleep light boats sail swift , though greater hulks draw deep .

o , sir , rude , in sooth , in good sooth , very rude .
well said , my lord !
well , you say so in fits .
i have business to my lord , dear queen .

he eats nothing but doves , love , and that breeds hot blood , and hot blood begets hot thoughts , and hot thoughts beget hot deeds , and hot deeds is love .
is this the generation of love ?
hot blood , hot thoughts , and hot deeds ?
why , they are vipers is love a generation of vipers ?
sweet lord , who ?
hector , deiphobus , helenus , antenor , and all the gallantry of troy i would fain have armed , but my nell would not have it so .
how chance my brother troilus went not ?
he hangs the lip at something you know all , lord pandarus .

exeunt scene ii .
the same .
pandarus ' orchard .
enter pandarus and troilus boy , meeting how now !
where thy master ?
at my cousin cressida ?
no , sir , he stays for you to conduct him thither .
o , here he comes .
enter troilus how now , how now !
sirrah , walk off .
exit boy have you seen my cousin ?
no , pandarus i stalk about her door , like a strange soul upon the stygian banks staying for waftage .
o , be thou my charon , and give me swift transportance to those fields where i may wallow in the proposed for the deserver !
o gentle pandarus , from cupid shoulder pluck his painted wings and fly with me to cressid !
walk here i ' the orchard , i bring her straight .
exit i am giddy , expectation whirls me round .
the imaginary relish is so sweet that it enchants my sense what will it be , when that the watery palate tastes indeed love thrice repured nectar ?
death , i fear me , swooning destruction , or some joy too fine , too , tuned too sharp in sweetness , for the capacity of my ruder powers i fear it much , and i do fear besides , that i shall lose distinction in my joys , as doth a battle , when they charge on heaps the enemy flying .
pandarus she making her ready , she come straight you must be witty now .
she does so blush , and fetches her wind so short , as if she were frayed with a sprite i fetch her .
it is the prettiest villain she fetches her breath as short as a sparrow .
exit even such a passion doth embrace my bosom my heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse , and all my powers do their bestowing lose , like vassalage at unawares encountering the eye of majesty .
pandarus with cressida come , come , what need you blush ?
shame a baby .
here she is now swear the oaths now to her that you have sworn to me .
what , are you gone again ?
you must be watched ere you be made tame , must you ?
come your ways , come your ways , an you draw backward , we put you i ' the fills .
why do you not speak to her ?
come , draw this curtain , and let see your picture .
alas the day , how loath you are to offend daylight !
an dark , close sooner .
so , so , rub on , and kiss the mistress .
how now !
a kiss in !
build there , carpenter , the air is sweet .
nay , you shall fight your hearts out ere i part you .
the falcon as the tercel , for all the ducks i ' the river go to , go to .
you have bereft me of all words , lady .
words pay no debts , give her deeds but she bereave you o ' the deeds too , if she call your activity in question .
what , billing again ?
here witness whereof the parties interchangeably ' come in , come in i go get a fire .
exit will you walk in , my lord ?
o cressida , how often have i wished me thus !
wished , my lord !
the gods grant , o my lord !
what should they grant ?
what makes this pretty abruption ?
what too curious dreg espies my sweet lady in the fountain of our love ?
more dregs than water , if my fears have eyes .
fears make devils of cherubims , they never see truly .
blind fear , that seeing reason leads , finds safer footing than blind reason stumbling without fear to fear the worst oft cures the worse .
o , let my lady apprehend no fear in all cupid pageant there is presented no monster .
nor nothing monstrous neither ?
nothing , but our undertakings , when we vow to weep seas , live in fire , eat rocks , tame tigers , thinking it harder for our mistress to devise imposition enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed .
this is the monstruosity in love , lady , that the will is infinite and the execution confined , that the desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit .
they say all lovers swear more performance than they are able and yet reserve an ability that they never perform , vowing more than the perfection of ten and discharging less than the tenth part of one .
they that have the voice of lions and the act of hares , are they not monsters ?
are there such ?
such are not we praise us as we are tasted , allow us as we prove , our head shall go bare till merit crown it no perfection in reversion shall have a praise in present we will not name desert before his birth , and , being born , his addition shall be humble .
few words to fair faith troilus shall be such to cressid as what envy can say worst shall be a mock for his truth , and what truth can speak truest not truer than troilus .
will you walk in , my lord ?
pandarus what , blushing still ?
have you not done talking yet ?
well , uncle , what folly i commit , i dedicate to you .
i thank you for that if my lord get a boy of you , you give him me .
be true to my lord if he flinch , chide me for it .
you know now your hostages , your uncle word and my firm faith .
nay , i give my word for her too our kindred , though they be long ere they are wooed , they are constant being won they are burs , i can tell you , they stick where they are thrown .
boldness comes to me now , and brings me heart .
prince troilus , i have loved you night and day for many weary months .
why was my cressid then so hard to win ?
hard to seem won but i was won , my lord , with the first glance that ever pardon me if i confess much , you will play the tyrant .
i love you now , but not , till now , so much but i might master it in faith , i lie , my thoughts were like unbridled children , grown too headstrong for their mother .
see , we fools !
why have i blabb ?
who shall be true to us , when we are so unsecret to ourselves ?
but , though i loved you well , i woo you not , and yet , good faith , i wish myself a man , or that we women had men privilege of speaking first .
sweet , bid me hold my tongue , for in this rapture i shall surely speak the thing i shall repent .
see , see , your silence , cunning in dumbness , from my weakness draws my very soul of counsel !
stop my mouth .
and shall , albeit sweet music issues thence .
pretty , i ' faith .
my lord , i do beseech you , pardon me , was not my purpose , thus to beg a kiss i am ashamed .
o heavens !
what have i done ?
for this time will i take my leave , my lord .
your leave , sweet cressid !
leave !
an you take leave till morning , pray you , content you .
what offends you , lady ?
sir , mine own company .
you can not shun yourself .
let me go and try i have a kind of self resides with you , but an unkind self , that itself will leave , to be another fool .
i would be gone where is my wit ?
i know not what i speak .
well know they what they speak that speak so wisely .
perchance , my lord , i show more craft than love , and fell so roundly to a large confession , to angle for your thoughts but you are wise , or else you love not , for to be wise and love exceeds man might , that dwells with gods above .
o that i thought it could be in a woman as , if it can , i will presume in you to feed for aye her ramp and flames of love , to keep her constancy in plight and youth , outliving beauty outward , with a mind that doth renew swifter than blood decays !
or that persuasion could but thus convince me , that my integrity and truth to you might be affronted with the match and weight of such a winnow purity in love , how were i then uplifted !
but , alas !
i am as true as truth simplicity and simpler than the infancy of truth .
in that i war with you .
o virtuous fight , when right with right wars who shall be most right !
true swains in love shall in the world to come approve their truths by troilus when their rhymes , full of protest , of oath and big compare , want similes , truth tired with iteration , as true as steel , as plantage to the moon , as sun to day , as turtle to her mate , as iron to adamant , as earth to the centre , yet , after all comparisons of truth , as truth authentic author to be cited , true as troilus ' shall crown up the verse , and sanctify the numbers .
prophet may you be !
if i be false , or swerve a hair from truth , when time is old and hath forgot itself , when waterdrops have worn the stones of troy , and blind oblivion swallow cities up , and mighty states characterless are grated to dusty nothing , yet let memory , from false to false , among false maids in love , upbraid my falsehood !
when they said false as air , as water , wind , or sandy earth , as fox to lamb , as wolf to heifer calf , pard to the hind , or stepdame to her son , ' , ' let them say , to stick the heart of falsehood , false as cressid . '
go to , a bargain made seal it , seal it , i be the witness .
here i hold your hand , here my cousin .
if ever you prove false one to another , since i have taken such pains to bring you together , let all pitiful be called to the world end after my name , call them all pandars , let all constant men be troiluses , all false women cressids , and all pandars !
say , amen .
amen .
amen .
amen .
whereupon i will show you a chamber with a bed , which bed , because it shall not speak of your pretty encounters , press it to death away !
and cupid grant all maidens here bed , chamber , pandar to provide this gear !
exeunt scene iii .
the grecian camp .
before achilles ' tent .
enter agamemnon , ulysses , diomedes , nestor , ajax , menelaus , and calchas now , princes , for the service i have done you , the advantage of the time prompts me aloud to call for recompense .
appear it to your mind that , through the sight i bear in things to love , i have abandon troy , left my possession , incurr a traitor name , exposed myself , from certain and possess conveniences , to doubtful fortunes , sequestering from me all that time , acquaintance , custom and condition made tame and most familiar to my nature , and here , to do you service , am become as new into the world , strange , unacquainted i do beseech you , as in way of taste , to give me now a little benefit , out of those many register in promise , which , you say , live to come in my behalf .
what wouldst thou of us , trojan ?
make demand .
you have a trojan prisoner , call antenor , yesterday took troy holds him very dear .
oft have you often have you thanks therefore desired my cressid in right great exchange , whom troy hath still denied but this antenor , i know , is such a wrest in their affairs that their negotiations all must slack , wanting his manage , and they will almost give us a prince of blood , a son of priam , in change of him let him be sent , great princes , and he shall buy my daughter , and her presence shall quite strike off all service i have done , in most accepted pain .
let diomedes bear him , and bring us cressid hither calchas shall have what he requests of us .
good diomed , furnish you fairly for this interchange withal bring word if hector will be answer in his challenge ajax is ready .
this shall i undertake , and is a burden which i am proud to bear .
exeunt diomedes and calchas enter achilles and patroclus , before their tent achilles stands i ' the entrance of his tent please it our general to pass strangely by him , as if he were forgot , and , princes all , lay negligent and loose regard upon him i will come last .
is like he question me why such unplausive eyes are bent on him if so , i have derision medicinable , to use between your strangeness and his pride , which his own will shall have desire to drink it may be good pride hath no other glass to show itself but pride , for supple knees feed arrogance and are the proud man fees .
we execute your purpose , and put on a form of strangeness as we pass along so do each lord , and either greet him not , or else disdainfully , which shall shake him more than if not look on .
i will lead the way .
what , comes the general to speak with me ?
you know my mind , i fight no more troy .
what says achilles ?
would he aught with us ?
would you , my lord , aught with the general ?
no .
nothing , my lord .
the better .
exeunt agamemnon and nestor good day , good day .
how do you ?
how do you ?
exit what , does the cuckold scorn me ?
how now , patroclus !
good morrow , ajax .
ha ?
good morrow .
ay , and good next day too .
exit what mean these fellows ?
know they not achilles ?
they pass by strangely they were used to bend to send their smiles before them to achilles , to come as humbly as they used to creep to holy altars .
what , am i poor of late ?
is certain , greatness , once out with fortune , must fall out with men too what the declined is he shall as soon read in the eyes of others as feel in his own fall , for men , like butterflies , show not their mealy wings but to the summer , and not a man , for being simply man , hath any honour , but honour for those honours that are without him , as place , riches , favour , prizes of accident as oft as merit which when they fall , as being slippery standers , the love that lean on them as slippery too , do one pluck down another and together die in the fall .
but is not so with me fortune and i are friends i do enjoy at ample point all that i did possess , save these men looks , who do , methinks , find out something not worth in me such rich beholding as they have often given .
here is ulysses , i interrupt his reading .
how now ulysses !
now , great thetis ' son !
what are you reading ?
a strange fellow here writes me man , how dearly ever parted , how much in having , or without or in , can not make boast to have that which he hath , nor feels not what he owes , but by reflection , as when his virtues shining upon others heat them and they retort that heat again to the first giver . '
this is not strange , ulysses .
the beauty that is borne here in the face the bearer knows not , but commends itself to others ' eyes , nor doth the eye itself , that most pure spirit of sense , behold itself , not going from itself , but eye to eye opposed salutes each other with each other form , for speculation turns not to itself , till it hath travell and is mirror there where it may see itself .
this is not strange at all .
i do not strain at the position , it is familiar , but at the author drift , who , in his circumstance , expressly proves that no man is the lord of any thing , though in and of him there be much consisting , till he communicate his parts to others nor doth he of himself know them for aught till he behold them form in the applause where they extended , who , like an arch , reverberates the voice again , or , like a gate of steel fronting the sun , receives and renders back his figure and his heat .
i was much wrapt in this , and apprehended here immediately the unknown ajax .
heavens , what a man is there !
a very horse , that has he knows not what .
nature , what things there are most abject in regard and dear in use !
what things again most dear in the esteem and poor in worth !
now shall we see an act that very chance doth throw upon him ajax renown .
o heavens , what some men do , while some men leave to do !
how some men creep in skittish fortune hall , whiles others play the idiots in her eyes !
how one man eats into another pride , while pride is fasting in his wantonness !
to see these grecian lords ! why , even already they clap the lubber ajax on the shoulder , as if his foot were on brave hector breast and great troy shrieking .
i do believe it , for they pass by me as misers do by beggars , neither gave to me good word nor look what , are my deeds forgot ?
time hath , my lord , a wallet at his back , wherein he puts alms for oblivion , a monster of ingratitudes those scraps are good deeds past , which are devour as fast as they are made , forgot as soon as done perseverance , dear my lord , keeps honour bright to have done is to hang quite out of fashion , like a rusty mail in monumental mockery .
take the instant way , for honour travels in a strait so narrow , where one but goes abreast keep then the path , for emulation hath a thousand sons that one by one pursue if you give way , or hedge aside from the direct forthright , like to an enter tide , they all rush by and leave you hindmost , or like a gallant horse in first rank , lie there for pavement to the abject rear , and trampled on then what they do in present , though less than yours in past , must yours , for time is like a fashionable host that slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand , and with his arms outstretch , as he would fly , grasps in the comer welcome ever smiles , and farewell goes out sighing .
o , let not virtue seek remuneration for the thing it was , for beauty , wit , high birth , vigour of bone , desert in service , love , friendship , charity , are subjects all to envious and calumniating time .
one touch of nature makes the whole world kin , that all with one consent praise gawds , though they are made and moulded of things past , and give to dust that is a little gilt more laud than gilt .
the present eye praises the present object .
then marvel not , thou great and complete man , that all the greeks begin to worship ajax , since things in motion sooner catch the eye than what not stirs .
the cry went once on thee , and still it might , and yet it may again , if thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive and case thy reputation in thy tent , whose glorious deeds , but in these fields of late , made emulous missions the gods themselves and drave great mars to faction .
of this my privacy i have strong reasons .
but your privacy the reasons are more potent and heroical is known , achilles , that you are in love with one of priam daughters .
ha !
known !
is that a wonder ?
the providence that in a watchful state knows almost every grain of plutus ' gold , finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps , keeps place with thought and almost , like the gods , does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles .
there is a mystery with whom relation durst never meddle in the soul of state , which hath an operation more divine than breath or pen can give expressure to all the commerce that you have had with troy as perfectly is ours as yours , my lord , and better would it fit achilles much to throw down hector than polyxena but it must grieve young pyrrhus now at home , when fame shall in our islands sound her trump , and all the greekish girls shall tripping sing , hector sister did achilles win , but our great ajax bravely beat down him . '
farewell , my lord i as your lover speak , the fool slides the ice that you should break .
exit to this effect , achilles , have i moved you a woman impudent and mannish grown is not more loathed than an effeminate man in time of action .
i stand condemn for this , they think my little stomach to the war and your great love to me restrains you thus sweet , rouse yourself , and the weak wanton cupid shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold , and , like a from the lion mane , be shook to air .
shall ajax fight with hector ?
ay , and perhaps receive much honour by him .
i see my reputation is at stake my fame is shrewdly gored .
o , then , beware , those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves omission to do what is necessary seals a commission to a blank of danger , and danger , like an ague , subtly taints even then when we sit idly in the sun .
go call thersites hither , sweet patroclus i send the fool to ajax and desire him to invite the trojan lords after the combat to see us here unarm i have a woman longing , an appetite that i am sick withal , to see great hector in his weeds of peace , to talk with him and to behold his visage , even to my full of view .
enter thersites a labour saved !
a wonder !
what ?
ajax goes up and down the field , asking for himself .
how so ?
he must fight singly with hector , and is so prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he raves in saying nothing .
how can that be ?
why , he stalks up and down like a peacock , a stride and a stand ruminates like an hostess that hath no arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning bites his lip with a politic regard , as who should say were wit in this head , an out , ' and so there is , but it lies as coldly in him as fire in a flint , which will not show without knocking .
the man undone forever , for if hector break not his neck i ' the combat , he break himself in .
he knows not me i said morrow , ajax , ' and he replies , agamemnon . '
what think you of this man that takes me for the general ?
he grown a very , , a monster .
a plague of opinion !
a man may wear it on both sides , like a leather jerkin .
thou must be my ambassador to him , thersites .
who , i ?
why , he answer nobody , he professes not answering speaking is for beggars , he wears his tongue in arms .
i will put on his presence let patroclus make demands to me , you shall see the pageant of ajax .
to him , patroclus , tell him i humbly desire the valiant ajax to invite the most valorous hector to come unarmed to my tent , and to procure for his person of the magnanimous and most illustrious of the grecian army , agamemnon , et cetera .
do this .
jove bless great ajax !
hum !
i come from the worthy achilles , ha !
who most humbly desires you to invite hector to his tent , hum !
and to procure from agamemnon .
agamemnon !
ay , my lord .
ha !
what say you ?
god b ' wi ' you , with all my heart .
your answer , sir .
if be a fair day , by eleven it will go one way or other howsoever , he shall pay for me ere he has me .
your answer , sir .
fare you well , with all my heart .
why , but he is not in this tune , is he ?
no , but he out o ' tune thus .
what music will be in him when hector has knocked out his brains , i know not , but , i am sure , none , unless the fiddler apollo get his sinews to make catlings on .
come , thou shalt bear a letter to him straight .
let me bear another to his horse , for that the more capable creature .
my mind is troubled , like a fountain stirr , and i myself see not the bottom of it .
exeunt achilles and patroclus would the fountain of your mind were clear again , that i might water an ass at it !
i had rather be a tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance .
exit act iv scene i .
troy .
a street .
enter , from one side , aeneas , and servant with a torch , from the other , paris , deiphobus , antenor , diomedes , and others , with torches see , ho !
who is that there ?
it is the lord aeneas .
is the prince there in person ?
had i so good occasion to lie long as you , prince paris , nothing but heavenly business should rob my of my company .
that my mind too .
good morrow , lord aeneas .
a valiant greek , aeneas , take his hand , witness the process of your speech , wherein you told how diomed , a whole week by days , did haunt you in the field .
health to you , valiant sir , during all question of the gentle truce , but when i meet you arm , as black defiance as heart can think or courage execute .
the one and other diomed embraces .
our bloods are now in calm , and , so long , health !
but when contention and occasion meet , by jove , i play the hunter for thy life with all my force , pursuit and policy .
and thou shalt hunt a lion , that will fly with his face backward .
in humane gentleness , welcome to troy !
now , by anchises ' life , welcome , indeed !
by venus ' hand i swear , no man alive can love in such a sort the thing he means to kill more excellently .
we sympathize jove , let aeneas live , if to my sword his fate be not the glory , a thousand complete courses of the sun !
but , in mine emulous honour , let him die , with every joint a wound , and that !
we know each other well .
we do , and long to know each other worse .
this is the most despiteful gentle greeting , the noblest hateful love , that i heard of .
what business , lord , so early ?
i was sent for to the king , but why , i know not .
his purpose meets you was to bring this greek to calchas ' house , and there to render him , for the enfreed antenor , the fair cressid let have your company , or , if you please , haste there before us i constantly do think or rather , call my thought a certain knowledge my brother troilus lodges there rouse him and give him note of our approach .
with the whole quality wherefore i fear we shall be much unwelcome .
that i assure you troilus had rather troy were borne to greece than cressid borne from troy .
there is no help , the bitter disposition of the time will have it so .
on , lord , we follow you .
good morrow , all .
exit with servant and tell me , noble diomed , faith , tell me true , even in the soul of sound , who , in your thoughts , merits fair helen best , myself or menelaus ?
both alike he merits well to have her , that doth seek her , not making any scruple of her soilure , with such a hell of pain and world of charge , and you as well to keep her , that defend her , not palating the taste of her dishonour , with such a costly loss of wealth and friends he , like a puling cuckold , would drink up the lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece , you , like a lecher , out of whorish loins are pleased to breed out your inheritors both merits poised , each weighs nor less nor more , but he as he , the heavier for a whore .
you are too bitter to your countrywoman .
she bitter to her country hear me , paris for every false drop in her bawdy veins a grecian life hath sunk , for every scruple of her contaminated carrion weight , a trojan hath been slain since she could speak , she hath not given so many good words breath as for her greeks and trojans suffer death .
fair diomed , you do as chapmen do , dispraise the thing that you desire to buy but we in silence hold this virtue well , we but commend what we intend to sell .
here lies our way .
exeunt scene ii .

court of pandarus ' house .
enter troilus and cressida dear , trouble not yourself the morn is cold .
then , sweet my lord , i call mine uncle down , he shall unbolt the gates .
trouble him not , to bed , to bed sleep kill those pretty eyes , and give as soft attachment to thy senses as infants ' empty of all thought !
good morrow , then .

but that the busy day , waked by the lark , hath roused the ribald crows , and dreaming night will hide our joys no longer , i would not from thee .
night hath been too brief .
beshrew the witch !
with venomous wights she stays as tediously as hell , but flies the grasps of love with wings more than thought .
you will catch cold , and curse me .
prithee , tarry you men will never tarry .
o foolish cressid !
i might have still held off , and then you would have tarried .

knocking within who that at door ?
good uncle , go and see .
my lord , come you again into my chamber you smile and mock me , as if i meant naughtily .
ha , ha !
come , you are deceived , i think of no such thing .
knocking within how earnestly they knock !
pray you , come in i would not for half troy have you seen here .
exeunt troilus and cressida who there ?
what the matter ?
will you beat down the door ?
how now !
what the matter ?
enter aeneas good morrow , lord , good morrow .
who there ?
my lord aeneas !
by my troth , i knew you not what news with you so early ?
is not prince troilus here ?
here !
what should he do here ?
come , he is here , my lord , do not deny him it doth import him much to speak with me .
is he here , say you ?
is more than i know , i be sworn for my own part , i came in late .
what should he do here ?
who ! nay , then come , come , you do him wrong ere you ware you be so true to him , to be false to him do not you know of him , but yet go fetch him hither , go .
troilus how now !
what the matter ?
my lord , i scarce have leisure to salute you , my matter is so rash there is at hand paris your brother , and deiphobus , the grecian diomed , and our antenor deliver to us , and for him forthwith , ere the first sacrifice , within this hour , we must give up to diomedes ' hand the lady cressida .
is it so concluded ?
by priam and the general state of troy they are at hand and ready to effect it .
how my achievements mock me !
i will go meet them and , my lord aeneas , we met by chance , you did not find me here .
good , good , my lord , the secrets of nature have not more gift in taciturnity .
exeunt troilus and aeneas possible ?
no sooner got but lost ?
the devil take antenor !
the young prince will go mad a plague upon antenor !
i would they had broke neck !
cressida how now !
what the matter ?
who was here ?
ah , ah !
why sigh you so profoundly ?
where my lord ?
gone !
tell me , sweet uncle , what the matter ?
would i were as deep under the earth as i am above !
o the gods !
what the matter ?
prithee , get thee in would thou hadst been born !
i knew thou wouldst be his death .
o , poor gentleman !
a plague upon antenor !
good uncle , i beseech you , on my knees !
beseech you , what the matter ?
thou must be gone , wench , thou must be gone , thou art changed for antenor thou must to thy father , and be gone from troilus be his death , be his bane , he can not bear it .
o you immortal gods !
i will not go .
thou must .
i will not , uncle i have forgot my father , i know no touch of consanguinity , no kin no love , no blood , no soul so near me as the sweet troilus .
o you gods divine !
make cressid name the very crown of falsehood , if ever she leave troilus !
time , force , and death , do to this body what extremes you can , but the strong base and building of my love is as the very centre of the earth , drawing all things to it .
i go in and weep , do , do .
tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks , crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart with sounding troilus .
i will not go from troy .
exeunt scene iii .
the same .
street before pandarus ' house .
enter paris , troilus , aeneas , deiphobus , antenor , and diomedes it is great morning , and the hour prefix of her delivery to this valiant greek comes fast upon .
good my brother troilus , tell you the lady what she is to do , and haste her to the purpose .
walk into her house , i bring her to the grecian presently and to his hand when i deliver her , think it an altar , and thy brother troilus a priest there offering to it his own heart .
exit i know what is to love , and would , as i shall pity , i could help !
please you walk in , my lords .
exeunt scene iv .
the same .
pandarus ' house .
enter pandarus and cressida be moderate , be moderate .
why tell you me of moderation ?
the grief is fine , full , perfect , that i taste , and violenteth in a sense as strong as that which causeth it how can i moderate it ?
if i could temporize with my affection , or brew it to a weak and colder palate , the like allayment could i give my grief .
my love admits no qualifying dross , no more my grief , in such a precious loss .
here , here , here he comes .
enter troilus ah , sweet ducks !
o troilus !
troilus !
embracing him what a pair of spectacles is here !
let me embrace too .
' o heart , ' as the goodly saying is , ' o heart , heavy heart , why thou without breaking ?
where he answers again , thou canst not ease thy smart by friendship nor by speaking . '
there was never a truer rhyme .
let us cast away nothing , for we may live to have need of such a verse we see it , we see it .
how now , lambs ?
cressid , i love thee in so strain a purity , that the bless gods , as angry with my fancy , more bright in zeal than the devotion which cold lips blow to their deities , take thee from me .
have the gods envy ?
ay , ay , ay , ay , is too plain a case .
and is it true that i must go from troy ?
a hateful truth .
what , and from troilus too ?
from troy and troilus .
is it possible ?
and suddenly , where injury of chance puts back , justles roughly by all time of pause , rudely beguiles our lips of all rejoindure , forcibly prevents our lock embrasures , strangles our dear vows even in the birth of our own labouring breath we two , that with so many thousand sighs did buy each other , must poorly sell ourselves with the rude brevity and discharge of one .
injurious time now with a robber haste crams his rich thievery up , he knows not how as many farewells as be stars in heaven , with distinct breath and consign kisses to them , he fumbles up into a lose adieu , and scants us with a single famish kiss , distasted with the salt of broken tears .
within my lord , is the lady ready ?
hark !
you are call some say the genius so cries ' to him that instantly must die .
bid them have patience , she shall come anon .
where are my tears ?
rain , to lay this wind , or my heart will be blown up by the root .
exit i must then to the grecians ?
no remedy .
a woful cressid the merry greeks !
when shall we see again ?
hear me , my love be thou but true of heart , i true !
how now !
what wicked deem is this ?
nay , we must use expostulation kindly , for it is parting from us i speak not thou true , ' as fearing thee , for i will throw my glove to death himself , that there no maculation in thy heart but thou true , ' say i , to fashion in my sequent protestation , be thou true , and i will see thee .
o , you shall be exposed , my lord , to dangers as infinite as imminent !
but i be true .
and i grow friend with danger .
wear this sleeve .
and you this glove .
when shall i see you ?
i will corrupt the grecian sentinels , to give thee nightly visitation .
but yet be true .
o heavens !
true ' again !
hear while i speak it , love the grecian youths are full of quality , they loving , well composed with gifts of nature , flowing and swelling with arts and exercise how novelty may move , and parts with person , alas , a kind of godly jealousy which , i beseech you , call a virtuous sin makes me afeard .
o heavens !
you love me not .
die i a villain , then !
in this i do not call your faith in question so mainly as my merit i can not sing , nor heel the high lavolt , nor sweeten talk , nor play at subtle games , fair virtues all , to which the grecians are most prompt and pregnant but i can tell that in each grace of these there lurks a still and devil that tempts most cunningly but be not tempted .
do you think i will ?
no .
but something may be done that we will not and sometimes we are devils to ourselves , when we will tempt the frailty of our powers , presuming on their changeful potency .
within nay , good my lord , come , kiss , and let us part .
within brother troilus !
good brother , come you hither , and bring aeneas and the grecian with you .
my lord , will you be true ?
who , i ?
alas , it is my vice , my fault whiles others fish with craft for great opinion , i with great truth catch mere simplicity , whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns , with truth and plainness i do wear mine bare .
fear not my truth the moral of my wit is and true , ' there all the reach of it .
enter aeneas , paris , antenor , deiphobus , and diomedes welcome , sir diomed !
here is the lady which for antenor we deliver you at the port , lord , i give her to thy hand , and by the way possess thee what she is .
entreat her fair , and , by my soul , fair greek , if thou stand at mercy of my sword , name cressida and thy life shall be as safe as priam is in ilion .
fair lady cressid , so please you , save the thanks this prince expects the lustre in your eye , heaven in your cheek , pleads your fair usage , and to diomed you shall be mistress , and command him wholly .
grecian , thou dost not use me courteously , to shame the zeal of my petition to thee in praising her i tell thee , lord of greece , she is as far thy praises as thou unworthy to be call her servant .
i charge thee use her well , even for my charge , for , by the dreadful pluto , if thou dost not , though the great bulk achilles be thy guard , i cut thy throat .
o , be not moved , prince troilus let me be privileged by my place and message , to be a speaker free , when i am hence i answer to my lust and know you , lord , i nothing do on charge to her own worth she shall be prized , but that you say so , ' i speak it in my spirit and honour , . '
come , to the port .
i tell thee , diomed , this brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head .
lady , give me your hand , and , as we walk , to our own selves bend we our needful talk .
exeunt troilus , cressida , and diomedes trumpet within hark !
hector trumpet .
how have we spent this morning !
the prince must think me tardy and remiss , that sore to ride before him to the field .
is troilus ' fault come , come , to field with him .
let us make ready straight .
yea , with a bridegroom fresh alacrity , let us address to tend on hector heels the glory of our troy doth this day lie on his fair worth and single chivalry .

trumpet sounds no trumpet answers .

is he , i ken the manner of his gait , he rises on the toe that spirit of his in aspiration lifts him from the earth .
enter diomedes , with cressida is this the lady cressid ?
even she .
most dearly welcome to the greeks , sweet lady .
our general doth salute you with a kiss .
yet is the kindness but particular , better she were kiss in general .
and very courtly counsel i begin .
so much for nestor .
i take what winter from your lips , fair lady achilles bids you welcome .
i had good argument for kissing once .
but that no argument for kissing now , for this popp paris in his hardiment , and parted thus you and your argument .
o deadly gall , and theme of all our scorns !
for which we lose our heads to gild his horns .
the first was menelaus ' kiss , this , mine patroclus kisses you .
o , this is trim !
paris and i kiss evermore for him .
i have my kiss , sir .
lady , by your leave .
in kissing , do you render or receive ?
both take and give .
i make my match to live , the kiss you take is better than you give , therefore no kiss .
i give you boot , i give you three for one .
you an odd man , give even or give none .
an odd man , lady !
every man is odd .
no , paris is not , for you know is true , that you are odd , and he is even with you .
you fillip me o ' the head .
no , i be sworn .
it were no match , your nail against his horn .
may i , sweet lady , beg a kiss of you ?
you may .
i do desire it .
why , beg , then .
why then for venus ' sake , give me a kiss , when helen is a maid again , and his .
i am your debtor , claim it when is due .
never my day , and then a kiss of you .
lady , a word i bring you to your father .
exit with cressida a woman of quick sense .
fie , fie upon her !
there language in her eye , her cheek , her lip , nay , her foot speaks , her wanton spirits look out at every joint and motive of her body .
o , these encounterers , so glib of tongue , that give accosting welcome ere it comes , and wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts to every ticklish reader !
set them down for sluttish spoils of opportunity and daughters of the game .
trumpet within the trojans ' trumpet .
yonder comes the troop .
enter hector , armed , aeneas , troilus , and other trojans , with attendants hail , all you state of greece !
what shall be done to him that victory commands ?
or do you purpose a victor shall be known ?
will you the knights shall to the edge of all extremity pursue each other , or shall be divided by any voice or order of the field ?
hector bade ask .
which way would hector have it ?
he cares not , he obey conditions .
is done like hector , but securely done , a little proudly , and great deal misprizing the knight opposed .
if not achilles , sir , what is your name ?
if not achilles , nothing .
therefore achilles but , , know this in the extremity of great and little , valour and pride excel themselves in hector , the one almost as infinite as all , the other blank as nothing .
weigh him well , and that which looks like pride is courtesy .
this ajax is half made of hector blood in love whereof , half hector stays at home , half heart , half hand , half hector comes to seek this blended knight , half trojan and half greek .
a maiden battle , then ?
o , i perceive you .
diomedes here is sir diomed .
go , gentle knight , stand by our ajax as you and lord aeneas consent upon the order of their fight , so be it , either to the uttermost , or else a breath the combatants being kin half stints their strife before their strokes begin .
ajax and hector enter the lists they are opposed already .
what trojan is that same that looks so heavy ?
the youngest son of priam , a true knight , not yet mature , yet matchless , firm of word , speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue , not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm his heart and hand both open and both free , for what he has he gives , what thinks he shows , yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty , nor dignifies an impure thought with breath , manly as hector , but more dangerous , for hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes to tender objects , but he in heat of action is more vindicative than jealous love they call him troilus , and on him erect a second hope , as fairly built as hector .
thus says aeneas , one that knows the youth even to his inches , and with private soul did in great ilion thus translate him to me .
alarum .
hector and ajax fight they are in action .
now , ajax , hold thine own !
hector , thou , awake thee !
his blows are well disposed there , ajax !
you must no more .
trumpets cease princes , enough , so please you .
i am not warm yet , let us fight again .
as hector pleases .
why , then will i no more thou art , great lord , my father sister son , a to great priam seed , the obligation of our blood forbids a gory emulation us twain were thy commixtion greek and trojan so that thou couldst say hand is grecian all , and this is trojan , the sinews of this leg all greek , and this all troy , my mother blood runs on the dexter cheek , and this sinister bounds in my father , ' by jove multipotent , thou shouldst not bear from me a greekish member wherein my sword had not impressure made of our rank feud but the just gods gainsay that any drop thou from thy mother , my sacred aunt , should by my mortal sword be drain !
let me embrace thee , ajax by him that thunders , thou hast lusty arms , hector would have them fall upon him thus cousin , all honour to thee !
i thank thee , hector thou art too gentle and too free a man i came to kill thee , cousin , and bear hence a great addition earned in thy death .
not neoptolemus so mirable , on whose bright crest fame with her oyes cries is he , ' could promise to himself a thought of added honour torn from hector .
there is expectance here from both the sides , what further you will do .
we answer it , the issue is embracement ajax , farewell .
if i might in entreaties find success as seld i have the chance i would desire my famous cousin to our grecian tents .
is agamemnon wish , and great achilles doth long to see unarm the valiant hector .
aeneas , call my brother troilus to me , and signify this loving interview to the expecters of our trojan part , desire them home .
give me thy hand , my cousin , i will go eat with thee and see your knights .
great agamemnon comes to meet us here .
the worthiest of them tell me name by name , but for achilles , mine own searching eyes shall find him by his large and portly size .
worthy of arms !
as welcome as to one that would be rid of such an enemy , but that no welcome understand more clear , what past and what to come is strew with husks and formless ruin of oblivion , but in this extant moment , faith and troth , strain purely from all hollow , bids thee , with most divine integrity , from heart of very heart , great hector , welcome .
i thank thee , most imperious agamemnon .
to troilus my lord of troy , no less to you .
let me confirm my princely brother greeting you brace of warlike brothers , welcome hither .
who must we answer ?
the noble menelaus .
o , you , my lord ?
by mars his gauntlet , thanks !
mock not , that i affect the untraded oath , your quondam wife swears still by venus ' glove she well , but bade me not commend her to you .
name her not now , sir , she a deadly theme .
o , pardon , i offend .
i have , thou gallant trojan , seen thee oft labouring for destiny make cruel way through ranks of greekish youth , and i have seen thee , as hot as perseus , spur thy phrygian steed , despising many forfeits and subduements , when thou hast hung thy advanced sword i ' the air , not letting it decline on the declined , that i have said to some my standers by , jupiter is yonder , dealing life ! '
and i have seen thee pause and take thy breath , when that a ring of greeks have hemm thee in , like an olympian wrestling this have i seen , but this thy countenance , still lock in steel , i never saw till now .
i knew thy grandsire , and once fought with him he was a soldier good , but , by great mars , the captain of us all , never saw like thee .
let an old man embrace thee , and , worthy warrior , welcome to our tents .
is the old nestor .
let me embrace thee , good old chronicle , that hast so long walk hand in hand with time most reverend nestor , i am glad to clasp thee .
i would my arms could match thee in contention , as they contend with thee in courtesy .
i would they could .
ha !
by this white beard , fight with thee .
well , welcome , welcome !
i have seen the time .
i wonder now how yonder city stands when we have here her base and pillar by us .
i know your favour , lord ulysses , well .
ah , sir , there many a greek and trojan dead , since first i saw yourself and diomed in ilion , on your greekish embassy .
sir , i foretold you then what would ensue my prophecy is but half his journey yet , for yonder walls , that pertly front your town , yond towers , whose wanton tops do buss the clouds , must kiss their own feet .
i must not believe you there they stand yet , and modestly i think , the fall of every phrygian stone will cost a drop of grecian blood the end crowns all , and that old common arbitrator , time , will one day end it .
so to him we leave it .
most gentle and most valiant hector , welcome after the general , i beseech you next to feast with me and see me at my tent .
i shall forestall thee , lord ulysses , thou !
now , hector , i have fed mine eyes on thee , i have with exact view perused thee , hector , and quoted joint by joint .
is this achilles ?
i am achilles .
stand fair , i pray thee let me look on thee .
behold thy fill .
nay , i have done already .
thou art too brief i will the second time , as i would buy thee , view thee limb by limb .
o , like a book of sport read me , but there more in me than thou .
why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye ?
tell me , you heavens , in which part of his body shall i destroy him ?
whether there , or there , or there ?
that i may give the local wound a name and make distinct the very breach whereout hector great spirit flew answer me , heavens !
it would discredit the blest gods , proud man , to answer such a question stand again thou to catch my life so pleasantly as to prenominate in nice conjecture where thou wilt hit me dead ?
i tell thee , yea .
wert thou an oracle to tell me so , i not believe thee .
henceforth guard thee well , for i not kill thee there , nor there , nor there , but , by the forge that stithied mars his helm , i kill thee every where , yea , and .
you wisest grecians , pardon me this brag , his insolence draws folly from my lips , but i endeavour deeds to match these words , or may i never do not chafe thee , cousin and you , achilles , let these threats alone , till accident or purpose bring you you may have every day enough of hector if you have stomach , the general state , i fear , can scarce entreat you to be odd with him .
i pray you , let us see you in the field we have had pelting wars , since you refused the grecians ' cause .
dost thou entreat me , hector ?
do i meet thee , fell as death , all friends .
thy hand upon that match .
first , all you peers of greece , go to my tent , there in the full convive we afterwards , as hector leisure and your bounties shall concur together , severally entreat him .
beat loud the tabourines , let the trumpets blow , that this great soldier may his welcome know .
exeunt all except troilus and ulysses my lord ulysses , tell me , i beseech you , in what place of the field doth calchas keep ?
at menelaus ' tent , most princely troilus there diomed doth feast with him , who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth , but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view on the fair cressid .
shall sweet lord , be bound to you so much , after we part from agamemnon tent , to bring me thither ?
you shall command me , sir .
as gentle tell me , of what honour was this cressida in troy ?
had she no lover there that wails her absence ?
o , sir , to such as boasting show their scars a mock is due .
will you walk on , my lord ?
she was beloved , she loved , she is , and doth but still sweet love is food for fortune tooth .
exeunt act v scene i .

before achilles ' tent .
enter achilles and patroclus i heat his blood with greekish wine , which with my scimitar i cool .
patroclus , let us feast him to the height .
here comes thersites .
enter thersites how now , thou core of envy !
thou crusty batch of nature , what the news ?
why , thou picture of what thou seemest , and idol of idiot worshippers , here a letter for thee .
from whence , fragment ?
why , thou full dish of fool , from troy .
who keeps the tent now ?
the surgeon box , or the patient wound .
well said , adversity !
and what need these tricks ?
prithee , be silent , boy , i profit not by thy talk thou art thought to be achilles ' male varlet .
male varlet , you rogue !
what that ?
why , his masculine whore .
now , the rotten diseases of the south , the , ruptures , catarrhs , loads o ' gravel i ' the back , lethargies , cold palsies , raw eyes , livers , wheezing lungs , bladders full of imposthume , sciaticas , limekilns i ' the palm , incurable , and the rivelled of the tetter , take and take again such preposterous discoveries !
why thou damnable box of envy , thou , what meanest thou to curse thus ?
do i curse thee ?
why no , you ruinous butt , you whoreson indistinguishable cur , no .
no !
why art thou then exasperate , thou idle immaterial skein of , thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye , thou tassel of a prodigal purse , thou ?
ah , how the poor world is pestered with such waterflies , diminutives of nature !
out , gall !
!
my sweet patroclus , i am thwarted quite from my great purpose in battle .
here is a letter from queen hecuba , a token from her daughter , my fair love , both taxing me and gaging me to keep an oath that i have sworn .
i will not break it fall greeks , fail fame , honour or go or stay , my major vow lies here , this i obey .
come , come , thersites , help to trim my tent this night in banqueting must all be spent .
away , patroclus !
exeunt achilles and patroclus with too much blood and too little brain , these two may run mad , but , if with too much brain and too little blood they do , i be a curer of madmen .
here agamemnon , an honest fellow enough and one that loves quails , but he has not so much brain as earwax and the goodly transformation of jupiter there , his brother , the bull , the primitive statue , and oblique memorial of cuckolds , a thrifty in a chain , hanging at his brother leg , to what form but that he is , should wit larded with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to ?
to an ass , were nothing , he is both ass and ox to an ox , were nothing , he is both ox and ass .
to be a dog , a mule , a cat , a fitchew , a toad , a lizard , an owl , a puttock , or a herring without a roe , i would not care , but to be menelaus , i would conspire against destiny .
ask me not , what i would be , if i were not thersites , for i care not to be the louse of a lazar , so i were not menelaus !

i will rather leave to see hector , than not to dog him they say he keeps a trojan drab , and uses the traitor calchas ' tent i after .

nay , stay , by jove , i will not speak a word there is between my will and all offences a guard of patience stay a little while .
how the devil luxury , with his fat rump and , tickles these together !
fry , lechery , fry !
but will you , then ?
in faith , i will , la , never trust me else .
give me some token for the surety of it .
i fetch you one .
exit you have sworn patience .
fear me not , sweet lord , i will not be myself , nor have cognition of what i feel i am all patience .
cressida now the pledge , now , now , now !
here , diomed , keep this sleeve .
o beauty !
where is thy faith ?
my lord , i will be patient , outwardly i will .
you look upon that sleeve , behold it well .
he loved me o false wench ! me again .
whose ?
it is no matter , now i again .
i will not meet with you night i prithee , diomed , visit me no more .
now she sharpens well said , whetstone !
i shall have it .
what , this ?
ay , that .
o , all you gods !
o pretty , pretty pledge !
thy master now lies thinking in his bed of thee and me , and sighs , and takes my glove , and gives memorial dainty kisses to it , as i kiss thee .
nay , do not snatch it from me , he that takes that doth take my heart withal .
i had your heart before , this follows it .
i did swear patience .
you shall not have it , diomed , faith , you shall not , i give you something else .
i will have this whose was it ?
it is no matter .
come , tell me whose it was .
was one that loved me better than you will .
but , now you have it , take it .
whose was it ?
by all diana yond , and by herself , i will not tell you whose .
will i wear it on my helm , and grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it .
wert thou the devil , and worest it on thy horn , it should be challenged .
well , well , is done , is past and yet it is not , i will not keep my word .
why , then , farewell , thou never shalt mock diomed again .
you shall not go one can not speak a word , but it straight starts you .
i do not like this fooling .
nor i , by pluto but that that likes not you pleases me best .
what , shall i come ?
the hour ?
ay , come o jove ! do come i shall be plagued .
farewell till then .
good night i prithee , come .
exit diomedes troilus , farewell !
one eye yet looks on thee but with my heart the other eye doth see .
ah , poor our sex !
this fault in us i find , the error of our eye directs our mind what error leads must err , o , then conclude minds sway by eyes are full of turpitude .
exit a proof of strength she could not publish more , unless she said ' my mind is now turn whore . '
all done , my lord .
it is .
why stay we , then ?
to make a recordation to my soul of every syllable that here was spoke .
but if i tell how these two did , shall i not lie in publishing a truth ?
sith yet there is a credence in my heart , an esperance so obstinately strong , that doth invert the attest of eyes and ears , as if those organs had deceptious functions , created only to calumniate .
was cressid here ?
i can not conjure , trojan .
she was not , sure .
most sure she was .
why , my negation hath no taste of madness .
nor mine , my lord cressid was here but now .
let it not be believed for womanhood !
think , we had mothers , do not give advantage to stubborn critics , apt , without a theme , for depravation , to square the general sex by cressid rule rather think this not cressid .
what hath she done , prince , that can soil our mothers ?
nothing at all , unless that this were she .
will he swagger himself out on own eyes ?
this she ?
no , this is diomed cressida if beauty have a soul , this is not she , if souls guide vows , if vows be sanctimonies , if sanctimony be the gods ' delight , if there be rule in unity itself , this is not she .
o madness of discourse , that cause sets up with and against itself !
authority !
where reason can revolt without perdition , and loss assume all reason without revolt this is , and is not , cressid .
within my soul there doth conduce a fight of this strange nature that a thing inseparate divides more wider than the sky and earth , and yet the spacious breadth of this division admits no orifex for a point as subtle as ariachne broken woof to enter .
instance , o instance !
strong as pluto gates , cressid is mine , tied with the bonds of heaven instance , o instance !
strong as heaven itself , the bonds of heaven are slipp , dissolved , and loosed , and with another knot , , the fractions of her faith , orts of her love , the fragments , scraps , the bits and greasy relics of her faith , are bound to diomed .
may worthy troilus be half attach with that which here his passion doth express ?
ay , greek , and that shall be divulged well in characters as red as mars his heart inflamed with venus never did young man fancy with so eternal and so fix a soul .
hark , greek as much as i do cressid love , so much by weight hate i her diomed that sleeve is mine that he bear on his helm , were it a casque composed by vulcan skill , my sword should bite it not the dreadful spout which shipmen do the hurricano call , constringed in mass by the almighty sun , shall dizzy with more clamour neptune ear in his descent than shall my prompted sword falling on diomed .
he tickle it for his concupy .
o cressid !
o false cressid !
false , false , false !
let all untruths stand by thy stained name , and they seem glorious .
o , contain yourself your passion draws ears hither .
enter aeneas i have been seeking you this hour , my lord hector , by this , is arming him in troy , ajax , your guard , stays to conduct you home .
have with you , prince .
my courteous lord , adieu .
farewell , revolted fair !
and , diomed , stand fast , and wear a castle on thy head !
i bring you to the gates .
accept distracted thanks .
exeunt troilus , aeneas , and ulysses would i could meet that rogue diomed !
i would croak like a raven , i would bode , i would bode .
patroclus will give me any thing for the intelligence of this whore the parrot will not do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab .

enter hector and andromache when was my lord so much ungently temper , to stop his ears against admonishment ?

no more , i say .
enter cassandra where is my brother hector ?
here , sister , arm , and bloody in intent .
consort with me in loud and dear petition , pursue we him on knees , for i have dream of bloody turbulence , and this whole night hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter .
o , is true .
ho !
bid my trumpet sound !
no notes of sally , for the heavens , sweet brother .
be gone , i say the gods have heard me swear .
the gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows they are polluted offerings , more abhorr than spotted livers in the sacrifice .
o , be persuaded !
do not count it holy to hurt by being just it is as lawful , for we would give much , to use violent thefts , and rob in the behalf of charity .
it is the purpose that makes strong the vow , but vows to every purpose must not hold unarm , sweet hector .
hold you still , i say , mine honour keeps the weather of my fate lie every man holds dear , but the brave man holds honour far more than life .
enter troilus how now , young man !
thou to fight ?
cassandra , call my father to persuade .
exit cassandra no , faith , young troilus , doff thy harness , youth , i am i ' the vein of chivalry let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong , and tempt not yet the brushes of the war .
unarm thee , go , and doubt thou not , brave boy , i stand for thee and me and troy .
brother , you have a vice of mercy in you , which better fits a lion than a man .
what vice is that , good troilus ?
chide me for it .
when many times the captive grecian falls , even in the fan and wind of your fair sword , you bid them rise , and live .
o , is fair play .
fool play , by heaven , hector .
how now !
how now !
for the love of all the gods , let leave the hermit pity with our mothers , and when we have our armours buckled on , the venom vengeance ride upon our swords , spur them to ruthful work , rein them from ruth .
fie , savage , fie !
hector , then is wars .
troilus , i would not have you fight .
who should withhold me ?
not fate , obedience , nor the hand of mars beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire , not priamus and hecuba on knees , their eyes with recourse of tears , not you , my brother , with your true sword drawn , opposed to hinder me , should stop my way , but by my ruin .
cassandra , with priam lay hold upon him , priam , hold him fast he is thy crutch , now if thou lose thy stay , thou on him leaning , and all troy on thee , fall all together .
come , hector , come , go back thy wife hath dream , thy mother hath had visions , cassandra doth foresee , and i myself am like a prophet suddenly enrapt to tell thee that this day is ominous therefore , come back .
aeneas is , and i do stand engaged to many greeks , even in the faith of valour , to appear this morning to them .
ay , but thou shalt not go .
i must not break my faith .
you know me dutiful , therefore , dear sir , let me not shame respect , but give me leave to take that course by your consent and voice , which you do here forbid me , royal priam .
o priam , yield not to him !
do not , dear father .
andromache , i am offended with you upon the love you bear me , get you in .
exit andromache this foolish , dreaming , superstitious girl makes all these bodements .
o , farewell , dear hector !
look , how thou diest !
look , how thy eye turns pale !
look , how thy wounds do bleed at many vents !
hark , how troy roars !
how hecuba cries out !
how poor andromache shrills her dolours forth !

o ' the side , the policy of those crafty swearing rascals , that stale old dry cheese , nestor , and that same , ulysses , is not proved worthy a blackberry they set me up , in policy , that mongrel cur , ajax , against that dog of as bad a kind , achilles and now is the cur ajax prouder than the cur achilles , and will not arm , whereupon the grecians begin to proclaim barbarism , and policy grows into an ill opinion .

what she ?
a virtuous maid , the daughter of a count that died some twelvemonth since , then leaving her in the protection of his son , her brother , who shortly also died for whose dear love , they say , she hath abjured the company and sight of men .
o that i served that lady and might not be delivered to the world , till i had made mine own occasion mellow , what my estate is !
that were hard to compass , because she will admit no kind of suit , no , not the duke .
there is a fair behavior in thee , captain , and though that nature with a beauteous wall doth oft close in pollution , yet of thee i will believe thou hast a mind that suits with this thy fair and outward character .
i prithee , and i pay thee bounteously , conceal me what i am , and be my aid for such disguise as haply shall become the form of my intent .
i serve this duke thou shall present me as an eunuch to him it may be worth thy pains , for i can sing and speak to him in many sorts of music that will allow me very worth his service .

sure , my noble lord , if she be so abandon to her sorrow as it is spoke , she never will admit me .

where , good mistress mary ?
in the wars , and that may you be bold to say in your foolery .
well , god give them wisdom that have it , and those that are fools , let them use their talents .
yet you will be hanged for being so long absent , or , to be turned away , is not that as good as a hanging to you ?
many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage , and , for turning away , let summer bear it out .
you are resolute , then ?
not so , neither , but i am resolved on two points .
that if one break , the other will hold , or , if both break , your gaskins fall .

take the fool away .
do you not hear , fellows ?

go to , you a dry fool , i no more of you besides , you grow dishonest .
two faults , madonna , that drink and good counsel will amend for give the dry fool drink , then is the fool not dry bid the dishonest man mend himself , if he mend , he is no longer dishonest , if he can not , let the botcher mend him .
any thing that mended is but patched virtue that transgresses is but patched with sin , and sin that amends is but patched with virtue .
if that this simple syllogism will serve , so , if it will not , what remedy ?
as there is no true cuckold but calamity , so beauty a flower .
the lady bade take away the fool , therefore , i say again , take her away .
sir , i bade them take away you .
misprision in the highest degree !
lady , cucullus non facit monachum , that as much to say as i wear not motley in my brain .
good madonna , give me leave to prove you a fool .
can you do it ?
dexterously , good madonna .
make your proof .
i must catechise you for it , madonna good my mouse of virtue , answer me .
well , sir , for want of other idleness , i bide your proof .
good madonna , why mournest thou ?
good fool , for my brother death .
i think his soul is in hell , madonna .
i know his soul is in heaven , fool .
the more fool , madonna , to mourn for your brother soul being in heaven .
take away the fool , gentlemen .
what think you of this fool , malvolio ?
doth he not mend ?
yes , and shall do till the pangs of death shake him infirmity , that decays the wise , doth ever make the better fool .
god send you , sir , a speedy infirmity , for the better increasing your folly !
sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox , but he will not pass his word for two pence that you are no fool .
how say you to that , malvolio ?
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal i saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no more brain than a stone .
look you now , he out of his guard already , unless you laugh and minister occasion to him , he is gagged .
i protest , i take these wise men , that crow so at these set kind of fools , no better than the fools ' zanies .
oh , you are sick of , malvolio , and taste with a distempered appetite .
to be generous , guiltless and of free disposition , is to take those things for that you deem there is no slander in an allowed fool , though he do nothing but rail , nor no railing in a known discreet man , though he do nothing but reprove .
now mercury endue thee with leasing , for thou speakest well of fools !
maria madam , there is at the gate a young gentleman much desires to speak with you .

exit malvolio madam , yond young fellow swears he will speak with you .
i told him you were sick , he takes on him to understand so much , and therefore comes to speak with you .
i told him you were asleep , he seems to have a foreknowledge of that too , and therefore comes to speak with you .

why , of mankind .
what manner of man ?
of very ill manner , he speak with you , will you or no .
of what personage and years is he ?
not yet old enough for a man , nor young enough for a boy , as a squash is before is a peascod , or a cooling when is almost an apple is with him in standing water , between boy and man .

most radiant , exquisite and unmatchable beauty , i pray you , tell me if this be the lady of the house , for i never saw her i would be loath to cast away my speech , for besides that it is excellently well penned , i have taken great pains to con it .
good beauties , let me sustain no scorn , i am very comptible , even to the least sinister usage .
whence came you , sir ?
i can say little more than i have studied , and that question out of my part .
good gentle one , give me modest assurance if you be the lady of the house , that i may proceed in my speech .
are you a comedian ?
no , my profound heart and yet , by the very fangs of malice i swear , i am not that i play .
are you the lady of the house ?
if i do not usurp myself , i am .
most certain , if you are she , you do usurp yourself , for what is yours to bestow is not yours to reserve .
but this is from my commission i will on with my speech in your praise , and then show you the heart of my message .
come to what is important i i forgive you the praise .
alas , i took great pains to study it , and is poetical .
it is the more like to be feigned i pray you , keep it in .
i heard you were saucy at my gates , and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you than to hear you .
if you be not mad , be gone , if you have reason , be brief is not that time of moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue .
will you hoist sail , sir ?

speak your office .
it alone concerns your ear .
i bring no overture of war , no taxation of homage i hold the olive in my hand , my words are as fun of peace as matter .
yet you began rudely .
what are you ?
what would you ?
the rudeness that hath appeared in me have i learned from my entertainment .
what i am , and what i would , are as secret as maidenhead , to your ears , divinity , to any other , profanation .
give us the place alone we will hear this divinity .
exeunt maria and attendants now , sir , what is your text ?
most sweet lady , a comfortable doctrine , and much may be said of it .
where lies your text ?
in orsino bosom .
in his bosom !
in what chapter of his bosom ?
to answer by the method , in the first of his heart .
o , i have read it it is heresy .
have you no more to say ?
good madam , let me see your face .

how does he love me ?
with adorations , fertile tears , with groans that thunder love , with sighs of fire .
your lord does know my mind , i can not love him yet i suppose him virtuous , know him noble , of great estate , of fresh and stainless youth , in voices well divulged , free , learn and valiant , and in dimension and the shape of nature a gracious person but yet i can not love him , he might have took his answer long ago .
if i did love you in my master flame , with such a suffering , such a deadly life , in your denial i would find no sense , i would not understand it .
why , what would you ?
make me a willow cabin at your gate , and call upon my soul within the house , write loyal cantons of contemned love and sing them loud even in the dead of night , halloo your name to the reverberate hills and make the babbling gossip of the air cry out ! '

nor will you not that i go with you ?
by your patience , no .
my stars shine darkly over me the malignancy of my fate might perhaps distemper yours , therefore i shall crave of you your leave that i may bear my evils alone it were a bad recompense for your love , to lay any of them on you .
antonio let me yet know of you whither you are bound .
no , sooth , sir my determinate voyage is mere extravagancy .
but i perceive in you so excellent a touch of modesty , that you will not extort from me what i am willing to keep in , therefore it charges me in manners the rather to express myself .
you must know of me then , antonio , my name is sebastian , which i called roderigo .
my father was that sebastian of messaline , whom i know you have heard of .
he left behind him myself and a sister , both born in an hour if the heavens had been pleased , would we had so ended !
but you , sir , altered that , for some hour before you took me from the breach of the sea was my sister drowned .
alas the day !
a lady , sir , though it was said she much resembled me , was yet of many accounted beautiful but , though i could not with such estimable wonder overfar believe that , yet thus far i will boldly publish her , she bore a mind that envy could not but call fair .
she is drowned already , sir , with salt water , though i seem to drown her remembrance again with more .
pardon me , sir , your bad entertainment .
o good antonio , forgive me your trouble .
if you will not murder me for my love , let me be your servant .
if you will not undo what you have done , that is , kill him whom you have recovered , desire it not .
fare ye well at once my bosom is full of kindness , and i am yet so near the manners of my mother , that upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell tales of me .
i am bound to the count orsino court farewell .

she adds , moreover , that you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none of him and one thing more , that you be never so hardy to come again in his affairs , unless it be to report your lord taking of this .
receive it so .
she took the ring of me i none of it .
come , sir , you peevishly threw it to her , and her will is , it should be so returned if it be worth stooping for , there it lies in your eye , if not , be it his that finds it .
exit i left no ring with her what means this lady ?
fortune forbid my outside have not charm her !
she made good view of me , indeed , so much , that sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue , for she did speak in starts distractedly .

how will this fadge ?
my master loves her dearly , and i , poor monster , fond as much on him , and she , mistaken , seems to dote on me .

as good a deed as to drink when a man , to challenge him the field , and then to break promise with him and make a fool of him .
, knight i write thee a challenge or i deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth .
sweet sir toby , be patient for tonight since the youth of the count was today with thy lady , she is much out of quiet .
for monsieur malvolio , let me alone with him if i do not gull him into a nayword , and make him a common recreation , do not think i have wit enough to lie straight in my bed i know i can do it .
possess us , possess us , tell us something of him .
marry , sir , sometimes he is a kind of puritan .
o , if i thought that beat him like a dog !
what , for being a puritan ?
thy exquisite reason , dear knight ?
i have no exquisite reason , but i have reason good enough .
the devil a puritan that he is , or any thing constantly , but a , an affectioned ass , that cons state without book and utters it by great swarths the best persuaded of himself , so crammed , as he thinks , with excellencies , that it is his grounds of faith that all that look on him love him , and on that vice in him will my revenge find notable cause to work .
what wilt thou do ?
i will drop in his way some obscure epistles of love , wherein , by the colour of his beard , the shape of his leg , the manner of his gait , the expressure of his eye , forehead , and complexion , he shall find himself most feelingly personated .
i can write very like my lady your niece on a forgotten matter we can hardly make distinction of our hands .
excellent !
i smell a device .
i in my nose too .
he shall think , by the letters that thou wilt drop , that they come from my niece , and that she in love with him .
my purpose is , indeed , a horse of that colour .
and your horse now would make him an ass .
ass , i doubt not .
o , be admirable !
sport royal , i warrant you i know my physic will work with him .
i will plant you two , and let the fool make a third , where he shall find the letter observe his construction of it .

duke orsino palace .
enter duke orsino , viola , curio , and others give me some music .
now , good morrow , friends .
now , good cesario , but that piece of song , that old and antique song we heard last night methought it did relieve my passion much , more than light airs and recollected terms of these most brisk and times come , but one verse .
he is not here , so please your lordship that should sing it .
who was it ?
feste , the jester , my lord , a fool that the lady olivia father took much delight in .
he is about the house .
seek him out , and play the tune the while .
exit curio .
music plays come hither , boy if ever thou shalt love , in the sweet pangs of it remember me , for such as i am all true lovers are , unstaid and skittish in all motions else , save in the constant image of the creature that is beloved .
how dost thou like this tune ?
it gives a very echo to the seat where love is throned .
thou dost speak masterly my life upo , young though thou art , thine eye hath stay upon some favour that it loves hath it not , boy ?
a little , by your favour .
what kind of woman ?
of your complexion .
she is not worth thee , then .
what years , i ' faith ?
about your years , my lord .
too old by heaven let still the woman take an elder than herself so wears she to him , so sways she level in her husband heart for , boy , however we do praise ourselves , our fancies are more giddy and unfirm , more longing , wavering , sooner lost and worn , than women are .
i think it well , my lord .
then let thy love be younger than thyself , or thy affection can not hold the bent , for women are as roses , whose fair flower being once display , doth fall that very hour .
and so they are alas , that they are so , to die , even when they to perfection grow !
curio and clown o , fellow , come , the song we had last night .
mark it , cesario , it is old and plain , the spinsters and the knitters in the sun and the free maids that weave their thread with bones do use to chant it it is silly sooth , and dallies with the innocence of love , like the old age .
are you ready , sir ?
ay , prithee , sing .
music song .
come away , come away , death , and in sad cypress let me be laid , fly away , fly away breath , i am slain by a fair cruel maid .
my shroud of white , stuck all with yew , o , prepare it !
my part of death , no one so true did share it .
not a flower , not a flower sweet on my black coffin let there be strown , not a friend , not a friend greet my poor corpse , where my bones shall be thrown a thousand thousand sighs to save , lay me , o , where sad true lover never find my grave , to weep there !
there for thy pains .
no pains , sir i take pleasure in singing , sir .
i pay thy pleasure then .
truly , sir , and pleasure will be paid , one time or another .
give me now leave to leave thee .
now , the melancholy god protect thee , and the tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta , for thy mind is a very opal .
i would have men of such constancy put to sea , that their business might be every thing and their intent every where , for that it that always makes a good voyage of nothing .
farewell .
exit let all the rest give place .
curio and attendants retire once more , cesario , get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty tell her , my love , more noble than the world , prizes not quantity of dirty lands , the parts that fortune hath bestow upon her , tell her , i hold as giddily as fortune , but is that miracle and queen of gems that nature pranks her in attracts my soul .
but if she can not love you , sir ?
i can not be so answer .
sooth , but you must .
say that some lady , as perhaps there is , hath for your love a great a pang of heart as you have for olivia you can not love her , you tell her so , must she not then be answer ?
there is no woman sides can bide the beating of so strong a passion as love doth give my heart , no woman heart so big , to hold so much , they lack retention alas , their love may be call appetite , no motion of the liver , but the palate , that suffer surfeit , cloyment and revolt , but mine is all as hungry as the sea , and can digest as much make no compare between that love a woman can bear me and that i owe olivia .
ay , but i know what dost thou know ?
too well what love women to men may owe in faith , they are as true of heart as we .
my father had a daughter loved a man , as it might be , perhaps , were i a woman , i should your lordship .
and what her history ?
a blank , my lord .
she never told her love , but let concealment , like a worm i ' the bud , feed on her damask cheek she pined in thought , and with a green and yellow melancholy she sat like patience on a monument , smiling at grief .
was not this love indeed ?
we men may say more , swear more but indeed our shows are more than will , for still we prove much in our vows , but little in our love .
but died thy sister of her love , my boy ?
i am all the daughters of my father house , and all the brothers too and yet i know not .
sir , shall i to this lady ?
ay , that the theme .
to her in haste , give her this jewel , say , my love can give no place , bide no denay .

though our silence be drawn from us with cars , yet peace .

saying , toby , my fortunes having cast me on your niece give me this prerogative of speech , ' what , what ?
must amend your drunkenness . '
out , scab !
nay , patience , or we break the sinews of our plot .

excellent wench , say i .

nay , but first , let me see , let me see , let me see .
what dish o ' poison has she dressed him !
and with what wing the staniel cheques at it !
' i may command where i adore . '
why , she may command me i serve her , she is my lady .
why , this is evident to any formal capacity , there is no obstruction in this and the end , what should that alphabetical position portend ?
if i could make that resemble something in me , softly !

sowter will cry upo for all this , though it be as rank as a fox .
m , malvolio , m , why , that begins my name .
did not i say he would work it out ?
the cur is excellent at faults .
m , but then there is no consonancy in the sequel , that suffers under probation a should follow but o does .
and o shall end , i hope .
ay , or i cudgel him , and make him cry o !
and then i comes behind .
ay , an you had any eye behind you , you might see more detraction at your heels than fortunes before you .
m , o , a , i , this simulation is not as the former and yet , to crush this a little , it would bow to me , for every one of these letters are in my name .
soft !
here follows prose .
reads this fall into thy hand , revolve .
in my stars i am above thee , but be not afraid of greatness some are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrust upon .
thy fates open their hands , let thy blood and spirit embrace them , and , to inure thyself to what thou art like to be , cast thy humble slough and appear fresh .
be opposite with a kinsman , surly with servants , let thy tongue tang arguments of state , put thyself into the trick of singularity she thus advises thee that sighs for thee .
remember who commended thy yellow stockings , and wished to see thee ever i say , remember .
go to , thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , if not , let me see thee a steward still , the fellow of servants , and not worthy to touch fortune fingers .
farewell .
she that would alter services with thee , the . '
daylight and champaign discovers not more this is open .
i will be proud , i will read politic authors , i will baffle sir toby , i will wash off gross acquaintance , i will be the very man .
i do not now fool myself , to let imagination jade me , for every reason excites to this , that my lady loves me .
she did commend my yellow stockings of late , she did praise my leg being , and in this she manifests herself to my love , and with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits of her liking .
i thank my stars i am happy .
i will be strange , stout , in yellow stockings , and , even with the swiftness of putting on .
jove and my stars be praised !
here is yet a postscript .
reads canst not choose but know who i am .
if thou entertainest my love , let it appear in thy smiling , thy smiles become thee well , therefore in my presence still smile , dear my sweet , i prithee . '
jove , i thank thee i will smile , i will do everything that thou wilt have me .
exit i will not give my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the sophy .
i could marry this wench for this device .
so could i too .
and ask no other dowry with her but such another jest .
nor i neither .
here comes my noble .
maria wilt thou set thy foot o ' my neck ?
or o ' mine either ?
shall i play my freedom at traytrip , and become thy ?
i ' faith , or i either ?
why , thou hast put him in such a dream , that when the image of it leaves him he must run mad .
nay , but say true , does it work upon him ?
like with a midwife .
if you will then see the fruits of the sport , mark his first approach before my lady he will come to her in yellow stockings , and is a colour she abhors , and , a fashion she detests , and he will smile upon her , which will now be so unsuitable to her disposition , being addicted to a melancholy as she is , that it can not but turn him into a notable contempt .
if you will see it , follow me .
to the gates of tartar , thou most excellent devil of wit !
i make one too .

no , sir , i live by the church .
art thou a churchman ?
no such matter , sir i do live by the church , for i do live at my house , and my house doth stand by the church .
so thou mayst say , the king lies by a beggar , if a beggar dwell near him , or , the church stands by thy tabour , if thy tabour stand by the church .
you have said , sir .
to see this age !
a sentence is but a cheveril glove to a good wit how quickly the wrong side may be turned outward !
nay , that certain , they that dally nicely with words may quickly make them wanton .
i would , therefore , my sister had had no name , sir .
why , man ?
why , sir , her name a word , and to dally with that word might make my sister wanton .
but indeed words are very rascals since bonds disgraced them .
thy reason , man ?
troth , sir , i can yield you none without words , and words are grown so false , i am loath to prove reason with them .
i warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing .
not so , sir , i do care for something , but in my conscience , sir , i do not care for you if that be to care for nothing , sir , i would it would make you invisible .
art not thou the lady olivia fool ?
no , indeed , sir , the lady olivia has no folly she will keep no fool , sir , till she be married , and fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to herrings , the husband the bigger i am indeed not her fool , but her corrupter of words .
i saw thee late at the count orsino .

nay , an thou pass upon me , i no more with thee .

my lady is within , sir .
i will construe to them whence you come , who you are and what you would are out of my welkin , i might say , ' but the word is .
exit this fellow is wise enough to play the fool , and to do that well craves a kind of wit he must observe their mood on whom he jests , the quality of persons , and the time , and , like the haggard , cheque at every feather that comes before his eye .
this is a practise as full of labour as a wise man art for folly that he wisely shows is fit , but wise men , , quite taint their wit .
enter sir toby belch , and sir andrew save you , gentleman .
and you , sir .
dieu vous garde , monsieur .
et vous aussi , votre serviteur .

my niece is desirous you should enter , if your trade be to her .
i am bound to your niece , sir , i mean , she is the list of my voyage .
taste your legs , sir , put them to motion .
my legs do better understand me , sir , than i understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs .
i mean , to go , sir , to enter .
i will answer you with gait and entrance .
but we are prevented .
enter olivia and maria most excellent accomplished lady , the heavens rain odours on you !
that youth a rare courtier odours , ' well .
my matter hath no voice , to your own most pregnant and vouchsafed ear .
, ' ' and ' i get all three all ready .
let the garden door be shut , and leave me to my hearing .
exeunt sir toby belch , sir andrew , and maria give me your hand , sir .
my duty , madam , and most humble service .
what is your name ?
cesario is your servant name , fair princess .
my servant , sir !
was never merry world since lowly feigning was call compliment you servant to the count orsino , youth .
and he is yours , and his must needs be yours your servant servant is your servant , madam .
for him , i think not on him for his thoughts , would they were blanks , rather than fill with me !
madam , i come to whet your gentle thoughts on his behalf .
o , by your leave , i pray you , i bade you never speak again of him but , would you undertake another suit , i had rather hear you to solicit that than music from the spheres .
dear lady , give me leave , beseech you .
i did send , after the last enchantment you did here , a ring in chase of you so did i abuse myself , my servant and , i fear me , you under your hard construction must i sit , to force that on you , in a shameful cunning , which you knew none of yours what might you think ?
have you not set mine honour at the stake and baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts that tyrannous heart can think ?
to one of your receiving enough is shown a cypress , not a bosom , hideth my heart .
so , let me hear you speak .
i pity you .
that a degree to love .
no , not a grize , for is a vulgar proof , that very oft we pity enemies .
why , then , methinks is time to smile again .
o , world , how apt the poor are to be proud !
if one should be a prey , how much the better to fall before the lion than the wolf !
clock strikes the clock upbraids me with the waste of time .
be not afraid , good youth , i will not have you and yet , when wit and youth is come to harvest , your were is alike to reap a proper man there lies your way , due west .
then !
grace and good disposition attend your ladyship !
you nothing , madam , to my lord by me ?
stay i prithee , tell me what thou thinkest of me .
that you do think you are not what you are .
if i think so , i think the same of you .
then think you right i am not what i am .
i would you were as i would have you be !
would it be better , madam , than i am ?
i wish it might , for now i am your fool .
o , what a deal of scorn looks beautiful in the contempt and anger of his lip !
a murderous guilt shows not itself more soon than love that would seem hid love night is noon .
cesario , by the roses of the spring , by maidhood , honour , truth and every thing , i love thee so , that , maugre all thy pride , nor wit nor reason can my passion hide .
do not extort thy reasons from this clause , for that i woo , thou therefore hast no cause , but rather reason thus with reason fetter , love sought is good , but given unsought better .
by innocence i swear , and by my youth i have one heart , one bosom and one truth , and that no woman has , nor never none shall mistress be of it , save i alone .
and so adieu , good madam never more will i my master tears to you deplore .
yet come again , for thou perhaps mayst move that heart , which now abhors , to like his love .
exeunt scene ii .
olivia house .
enter sir toby belch , sir andrew , and fabian no , faith , i not stay a jot longer .
thy reason , dear venom , give thy reason .
you must needs yield your reason , sir andrew .
marry , i saw your niece do more favours to the count than ever she bestowed upon me , i i ' the orchard .
did she see thee the while , old boy ?
tell me that .
as plain as i see you now .
this was a great argument of love in her toward you .
, will you make an ass o ' me ?
i will prove it legitimate , sir , upon the oaths of judgment and reason .
and they have been since before noah was a sailor .
she did show favour to the youth in your sight only to exasperate you , to awake your dormouse valour , to put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver .
you should then have accosted her , and with some excellent jests , from the mint , you should have banged the youth into dumbness .
this was looked for at your hand , and this was balked the double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash off , and you are now sailed into the north of my lady opinion , where you will hang like an icicle on a dutchman beard , unless you do redeem it by some laudable attempt either of valour or policy .
a be any way , it must be with valour , for policy i hate i had as lief be a brownist as a politician .
why , then , build me thy fortunes upon the basis of valour .
challenge me the count youth to fight with him , hurt him in eleven places my niece shall take note of it , and assure thyself , there is no in the world can more prevail in man commendation with woman than report of valour .
there is no way but this , sir andrew .
will either of you bear me a challenge to him ?
go , write it in a martial hand , be curst and brief , it is no matter how witty , so it be eloquent and fun of invention taunt him with the licence of ink if thou him some thrice , it shall not be amiss , and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of paper , although the sheet were big enough for the bed of ware in england , set down go , about it .
let there be gall enough in thy ink , though thou write with a , no matter about it .
where shall i find you ?
we call thee at the cubiculo go .
exit sir andrew this is a dear manikin to you , sir toby .
i have been dear to him , lad , some two thousand strong , or so .
we shall have a rare letter from him but you not ?
never trust me , then , and by all means stir on the youth to an answer .
i think oxen and wainropes can not hale them together .
for andrew , if he were opened , and you find so much blood in his liver as will clog the foot of a flea , i eat the rest of the anatomy .
and his opposite , the youth , bears in his visage no great presage of cruelty .
enter maria look , where the youngest wren of nine comes .
if you desire the spleen , and will laugh yourself into stitches , follow me .
yond gull malvolio is turned heathen , a very renegado , for there is no christian , that means to be saved by believing rightly , can ever believe such impossible passages of grossness .
he in yellow stockings .
and ?
most villanously , like a pedant that keeps a school i ' the church .
i have dogged him , like his murderer .
he does obey every point of the letter that i dropped to betray him he does smile his face into more lines than is in the new map with the augmentation of the indies you have not seen such a thing as is .
i can hardly forbear hurling things at him .
i know my lady will strike him if she do , he smile and for a great favour .
come , bring us , bring us where he is .
exeunt scene iii .
a street .
enter sebastian and antonio i would not by my will have troubled you , but , since you make your pleasure of your pains , i will no further chide you .
i could not stay behind you my desire , more sharp than filed steel , did spur me forth , and not all love to see you , though so much as might have drawn one to a longer voyage , but jealousy what might befall your travel , being skilless in these parts , which to a stranger , unguided and unfriended , often prove rough and unhospitable my willing love , the rather by these arguments of fear , set forth in your pursuit .
my kind antonio , i can no other answer make but thanks , and thanks , and ever oft good turns are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay but , were my worth as is my conscience firm , you should find better dealing .
what to do ?
shall we go see the reliques of this town ?
, sir best first go see your lodging .
i am not weary , and is long to night i pray you , let us satisfy our eyes with the memorials and the things of fame that do renown this city .
would pardon me , i do not without danger walk these streets once , in a , the count his galleys i did some service , of such note indeed , that were i here it would scarce be answer .
belike you slew great number of his people .
the offence is not of such a bloody nature , albeit the quality of the time and quarrel might well have given us bloody argument .
it might have since been answer in repaying what we took from them , which , for traffic sake , most of our city did only myself stood out , for which , if i be lapsed in this place , i shall pay dear .
do not then walk too open .
it doth not fit me .
hold , sir , here my purse .
in the south suburbs , at the elephant , is best to lodge i will bespeak our diet , whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge with viewing of the town there shall you have me .
why i your purse ?
haply your eye shall light upon some toy you have desire to purchase , and your store , i think , is not for idle markets , sir .
i be your and leave you for an hour .
to the elephant .
i do remember .
exeunt scene iv .
olivia garden .
enter olivia and maria i have sent after him he says he come , how shall i feast him ?
what bestow of him ?
for youth is bought more oft than begg or borrow .
i speak too loud .
where is malvolio ?
he is sad and civil , and suits well for a servant with my fortunes where is malvolio ?
he coming , madam , but in very strange manner .
he is , sure , possessed , madam .
why , what the matter ?
does he rave ?
no .
madam , he does nothing but smile your ladyship were best to have some guard about you , if he come , for , sure , the man is tainted in wits .
go call him hither .
exit maria i am as mad as he , if sad and merry madness equal be .
maria , with malvolio how now , malvolio !
sweet lady , ho , ho .
smilest thou ?
i sent for thee upon a sad occasion .
sad , lady !
i could be sad this does make some obstruction in the blood , this , but what of that ?
if it please the eye of one , it is with me as the very true sonnet is , one , and please all . '
why , how dost thou , man ?
what is the matter with thee ?
not black in my mind , though yellow in my legs .
it did come to his hands , and commands shall be executed i think we do know the sweet roman hand .
wilt thou go to bed , malvolio ?
to bed !
ay , , and i come to thee .
god comfort thee !
why dost thou smile so and kiss thy hand so oft ?
how do you , malvolio ?
at your request !
yes , nightingales answer daws .
why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady ?
not afraid of greatness ' was well writ .
what meanest thou by that , malvolio ?
are born great , ' ha !
achieve greatness , ' what sayest thou ?
some have greatness thrust upon them . '
heaven restore thee !
who commended thy yellow stocking s , ' thy yellow stockings !
wished to see thee . '
!
to thou art made , if thou desirest to be so , ' am i made ?
not , let me see thee a servant still . '
why , this is very midsummer madness .
enter servant madam , the young gentleman of the count orsino is returned i could hardly entreat him back he attends your ladyship pleasure .
i come to him .
exit servant good maria , let this fellow be looked to .
where my cousin toby ?
let some of my people have a special care of him i would not have him miscarry for the half of my dowry .
exeunt olivia and maria o , ho !
do you come near me now ?
no worse man than sir toby to look to me !
this concurs directly with the letter she sends him on purpose , that i may appear stubborn to him , for she incites me to that in the letter .
thy humble slough , ' says she , opposite with a kinsman , surly with servants , let thy tongue tang with arguments of state , put thyself into the trick of singularity , ' and consequently sets down the manner how , as , a sad face , a reverend carriage , a slow tongue , in the habit of some sir of note , and so forth .
i have limed her , but it is jove doing , and jove make me thankful !
and when she went away now , this fellow be looked to ' fellow !
not malvolio , nor after my degree , but fellow .
why , every thing adheres together , that no dram of a scruple , no scruple of a scruple , no obstacle , no incredulous or unsafe circumstance what can be said ?
nothing that can be can come between me and the full prospect of my hopes .
well , jove , not i , is the doer of this , and he is to be thanked .
maria , with sir toby belch and fabian which way is he , in the name of sanctity ?
if all the devils of hell be drawn in little , and legion himself possessed him , yet i speak to him .
here he is , here he is .
how with you , sir ?
how with you , man ?
go off , i discard you let me enjoy my private go off .
lo , how hollow the fiend speaks within him !
did not i tell you ?
sir toby , my lady prays you to have a care of him .
ah , ha !
does she so ?
go to , go to , peace , peace , we must deal gently with him let me alone .
how do you , malvolio ?
how with you ?
what , man !
defy the devil consider , he an enemy to mankind .
do you know what you say ?
la you , an you speak ill of the devil , how he takes it at heart !
pray god , he be not bewitched !
carry his water to the wise woman .
marry , and it shall be done morning , if i live .
my lady would not lose him for more than i say .
how now , mistress !
o lord !
prithee , hold thy peace , this is not the way do you not see you move him ?
let me alone with him .
no way but gentleness , gently , gently the fiend is rough , and will not be roughly used .
why , how now , my bawcock !
how dost thou , chuck ?
sir !
ay , biddy , come with me .
what , man !
is not for gravity to play at with satan hang him , foul collier !
get him to say his prayers , good sir toby , get him to pray .
my prayers , minx !
no , i warrant you , he will not hear of godliness .
go , hang yourselves all !
you are idle shallow things i am not of your element you shall know more hereafter .
exit possible ?
if this were played upon a stage now , i could condemn it as an improbable fiction .
his very genius hath taken the infection of the device , man .
nay , pursue him now , lest the device take air and taint .
why , we shall make him mad indeed .
the house will be the quieter .
come , we have him in a dark room and bound .
my niece is already in the belief that he mad we may carry it thus , for our pleasure and his penance , till our very pastime , tired out of breath , prompt us to have mercy on him at which time we will bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a finder of madmen .
but see , but see .
enter sir andrew more matter for a may morning .
here the challenge , read it warrant there vinegar and pepper i .
so saucy ?
ay , , i warrant him do but read .
give me .
reads , whatsoever thou art , thou art but a scurvy fellow . '
good , and valiant .
reads not , nor admire not in thy mind , why i do call thee so , for i will show thee no reason . '
a good note , that keeps you from the blow of the law .
reads comest to the lady olivia , and in my sight she uses thee kindly but thou liest in thy throat , that is not the matter i challenge thee for . '
very brief , and to exceeding good sense less .
reads ' i will waylay thee going home , where if it be thy chance to kill me , ' good .
reads killest me like a rogue and a villain . '
still you keep o ' the windy side of the law good .
reads thee well , and god have mercy upon one of our souls !
he may have mercy upon mine , but my hope is better , and so look to thyself .
thy friend , as thou usest him , and thy sworn enemy , andrew aguecheek .
if this letter move him not , his legs can not i him .
you may have very fit occasion he is now in some commerce with my lady , and will by and by depart .
go , sir andrew scout me for him at the corner the orchard like a so soon as ever thou seest him , draw , and , as thou drawest swear horrible , for it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath , with a swaggering accent sharply twanged off , gives manhood more approbation than ever proof itself would have earned him .
away !
nay , let me alone for swearing .
exit now will not i deliver his letter for the behavior of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good capacity and breeding , his employment between his lord and my niece confirms no less therefore this letter , being so excellently ignorant , will breed no terror in the youth he will find it comes from a clodpole .
but , sir , i will deliver his challenge by word of mouth , set upon aguecheek a notable report of valour , and drive the gentleman , as i know his youth will aptly receive it , into a most hideous opinion of his rage , skill , fury and impetuosity .
this will so fright them both that they will kill one another by the look , like cockatrices .
olivia , with viola here he comes with your niece give them way till he take leave , and presently after him .
i will meditate the while upon some horrid message for a challenge .
exeunt sir toby belch , fabian , and maria i have said too much unto a heart of stone and laid mine honour too unchary out there something in me that reproves my fault , but such a headstrong potent fault it is , that it but mocks reproof .
with the same that your passion bears goes on my master grief .
here , wear this jewel for me , is my picture , refuse it not , it hath no tongue to vex you , and i beseech you come again .
what shall you ask of me that i deny , that honour saved may upon asking give ?
nothing but this , your true love for my master .
how with mine honour may i give him that which i have given to you ?
i will acquit you .
well , come again fare thee well a fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell .
exit sir toby belch and fabian gentleman , god save thee .
and you , sir .
that defence thou hast , betake thee of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him , i know not , but thy intercepter , full of despite , bloody as the hunter , attends thee at the dismount thy tuck , be yare in thy preparation , for thy assailant is quick , skilful and deadly .
you mistake , sir , i am sure no man hath any quarrel to me my remembrance is very free and clear from any image of offence done to any man .
you find it otherwise , i assure you therefore , if you hold your life at any price , betake you to your guard , for your opposite hath in him what youth , strength , skill and wrath can furnish man withal .
i pray you , sir , what is he ?
he is knight , dubbed with unhatched rapier and on carpet consideration , but he is a devil in private brawl souls and bodies hath he divorced three , and his incensement at this moment is so implacable , that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death and sepulchre .
hob , nob , is his word , or .
i will return again into the house and desire some conduct of the lady .
i am no fighter .
i have heard of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on others , to taste their valour belike this is a man of that quirk .
sir , no , his indignation derives itself out of a very competent injury therefore , get you on and give him his desire .
back you shall not to the house , unless you undertake that with me which with as much safety you might answer him therefore , on , or strip your sword stark naked , for meddle you must , that certain , or forswear to wear iron about you .
this is as uncivil as strange .
i beseech you , do me this courteous office , as to know of the knight what my offence to him is it is something of my negligence , nothing of my purpose .
i will do so .
signior fabian , stay you by this gentleman till my return .
exit pray you , sir , do you know of this matter ?
i know the knight is incensed against you , even to a mortal arbitrement , but nothing of the circumstance more .
i beseech you , what manner of man is he ?
nothing of that wonderful promise , to read him by his form , as you are like to find him in the proof of his valour .
he is , indeed , sir , the most skilful , bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly have found in any part of illyria .
will you walk towards him ?
i will make your peace with him if i can .
i shall be much bound to you i am one that had rather go with sir priest than sir knight i care not who knows so much of my mettle .
exeunt sir toby belch , with sir andrew why , man , he a very devil , i have not seen such a firago .
i had a pass with him , rapier , scabbard and all , and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal motion , that it is inevitable , and on the answer , he pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they step on .
they say he has been fencer to the sophy .
pox o , i not meddle with him .
ay , but he will not now be pacified fabian can scarce hold him yonder .
plague o , an i thought he had been valiant and so cunning in fence , have seen him damned ere have challenged him .
let him let the matter slip , and i give him my horse , grey capilet .
i make the motion stand here , make a good show o this shall end without the perdition of souls .
aside marry , i ride your horse as well as i ride you .
fabian and viola to fabian i have his horse to take up the quarrel i have persuaded him the youth a devil .
he is as horribly conceited of him , and pants and looks pale , as if a bear were at his heels .
to viola there no remedy , sir , he will fight with you for oath sake marry , he hath better bethought him of his quarrel , and he finds that now scarce to be worth talking of therefore draw , for the supportance of his vow , he protests he will not hurt you .
aside pray god defend me !
a little thing would make me tell them how much i lack of a man .
give ground , if you see him furious .
come , sir andrew , there no remedy , the gentleman will , for his honour sake , have one bout with you , he can not by the duello avoid it but he has promised me , as he is a gentleman and a soldier , he will not hurt you .
come on , .
pray god , he keep his oath !
i do assure you , is against my will .
they draw enter antonio put up your sword .
if this young gentleman have done offence , i take the fault on me if you offend him , i for him defy you .
you , sir !
why , what are you ?
one , sir , that for his love dares yet do more than you have heard him brag to you he will .
nay , if you be an undertaker , i am for you .
they draw enter officers o good sir toby , hold !
here come the officers .
i be with you anon .
pray , sir , put your sword up , if you please .
marry , will i , sir , and , for that i promised you , i be as good as my word he will bear you easily and reins well .
this is the man , do thy office .
antonio , i arrest thee at the suit of count orsino .
you do mistake me , sir .
no , sir , no jot , i know your favour well , though now you have no on your head .
take him away he knows i know him well .
i must obey .
to viola this comes with seeking you but there no remedy , i shall answer it .
what will you do , now my necessity makes me to ask you for my purse ?
it grieves me much more for what i can not do for you than what befalls myself .
you stand amazed , but be of comfort .
come , sir , away .
i must entreat of you some of that money .
what money , sir ?
for the fair kindness you have show me here , and , part , being prompted by your present trouble , out of my lean and low ability i lend you something my having is not much , i make division of my present with you hold , there half my coffer .
will you deny me now ?
possible that my deserts to you can lack persuasion ?
do not tempt my misery , lest that it make me so unsound a man as to upbraid you with those kindnesses that i have done for you .
i know of none , nor know i you by voice or any feature i hate ingratitude more in a man than lying , vainness , babbling , drunkenness , or any taint of vice whose strong corruption inhabits our frail blood .
o heavens themselves !
come , sir , i pray you , go .
let me speak a little .
this youth that you see here i snatch one half out of the jaws of death , relieved him with such sanctity of love , and to his image , which methought did promise most venerable worth , did i devotion .
what that to us ?
the time goes by away !
but o how vile an idol proves this god thou hast , sebastian , done good feature shame .
in nature there no blemish but the mind , none can be call deform but the unkind virtue is beauty , but the beauteous evil are empty trunks by the devil .
the man grows mad away with him !
come , come , sir .
lead me on .
exit with officers methinks his words do from such passion fly , that he believes himself so do not i .
prove true , imagination , o , prove true , that i , dear brother , be now for you !
come hither , knight , come hither , fabian we whisper a couplet or two of most sage saws .
he named sebastian i my brother know yet living in my glass , even such and so in favour was my brother , and he went still in this fashion , colour , ornament , for him i imitate o , if it prove , tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love .
exit a very dishonest paltry boy , and more a coward than a hare his dishonesty appears in leaving his friend here in necessity and denying him , and for his cowardship , ask fabian .
a coward , a most devout coward , religious in it .
, i after him again and beat him .
do , cuff him soundly , but never draw thy sword .
an i do not , come , let see the event .
i dare lay any money be nothing yet .

why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes , and the clearstores toward the south north are as lustrous as ebony , and yet complainest thou of obstruction ?
i am not mad , sir topas i say to you , this house is dark .
madman , thou errest i say , there is no darkness but ignorance , in which thou art more puzzled than the egyptians in their fog .
i say , this house is as dark as ignorance , though ignorance were as dark as hell , and i say , there was never man thus abused .
i am no more mad than you are make the trial of it in any constant question .
what is the opinion of pythagoras concerning wild fowl ?
that the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird .
what thinkest thou of his opinion ?
i think nobly of the soul , and no way approve his opinion .
fare thee well .
remain thou still in darkness thou shalt hold the opinion of pythagoras ere i will allow of thy wits , and fear to kill a woodcock , lest thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam .
fare thee well .
sir topas , sir topas !
my most exquisite sir topas !

exit scene iii .
olivia garden .
enter sebastian this is the air , that is the glorious sun , this pearl she gave me , i do and , and though is wonder that enwraps me thus , yet is not madness .
where antonio , then ?
i could not find him at the elephant yet there he was , and there i found this credit , that he did range the town to seek me out .
his counsel now might do me golden service , for though my soul disputes well with my sense , that this may be some error , but no madness , yet doth this accident and flood of fortune so far exceed all instance , all discourse , that i am ready to distrust mine eyes and wrangle with my reason that persuades me to any other trust but that i am mad or else the lady mad , yet , if so , she could not sway her house , command her followers , take and give back affairs and their dispatch with such a smooth , discreet and stable bearing as i perceive she does there something i that is deceiveable .
but here the lady comes .
enter olivia and priest blame not this haste of mine .
if you mean well , now go with me and with this holy man into the chantry by there , before him , and underneath that consecrated roof , plight me the full assurance of your faith , that my most jealous and too doubtful soul may live at peace .
he shall conceal it whiles you are willing it shall come to note , what time we will our celebration keep according to my birth .
what do you say ?
i follow this good man , and go with you , and , having sworn truth , ever will be true .
then lead the way , good father , and heavens so shine , that they may fairly note this act of mine !
exeunt act v scene i .
before olivia house .
enter clown and fabian now , as thou lovest me , let me see his letter .
good master fabian , grant me another request .
any thing .
do not desire to see this letter .
this is , to give a dog , and in recompense desire my dog again .
enter duke orsino , viola , curio , and lords belong you to the lady olivia , friends ?
ay , sir , we are some of her trappings .
i know thee well , how dost thou , my good fellow ?
truly , sir , the better for my foes and the worse for my friends .
just the contrary , the better for thy friends .
no , sir , the worse .
how can that be ?
marry , sir , they praise me and make an ass of me , now my foes tell me plainly i am an ass so that by my foes , sir i profit in the knowledge of myself , and by my friends , i am abused so that , conclusions to be as kisses , if your four negatives make your two affirmatives why then , the worse for my friends and the better for my foes .
why , this is excellent .
by my troth , sir , no , though it please you to be one of my friends .
thou shalt not be the worse for me there gold .
but that it would be , sir , i would you could make it another .
o , you give me ill counsel .
put your grace in your pocket , sir , for this once , and let your flesh and blood obey it .
well , i will be so much a sinner , to be a there another .
primo , secundo , tertio , is a good play , and the old saying is , the third pays for all the triplex , sir , is a good tripping measure , or the bells of saint bennet , sir , may put you in mind , one , two , three .
you can fool no more money out of me at this throw if you will let your lady know i am here to speak with her , and bring her along with you , it may awake my bounty further .
marry , sir , lullaby to your bounty till i come again .
i go , sir , but i would not have you to think that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness but , as you say , sir , let your bounty take a nap , i will awake it anon .
exit here comes the man , sir , that did rescue me .
enter antonio and officers that face of his i do remember well , yet , when i saw it last , it was besmear as black as vulcan in the smoke of war a bawbling vessel was he captain of , for shallow draught and bulk unprizable , with which such scathful grapple did he make with the most noble bottom of our fleet , that very envy and the tongue of loss cried fame and honour on him .
what the matter ?
orsino , this is that antonio that took the phoenix and her fraught from candy , and this is he that did the tiger board , when your young nephew titus lost his leg here in the streets , desperate of shame and state , in private brabble did we apprehend him .
he did me kindness , sir , drew on my side , but in conclusion put strange speech upon me i know not what was but distraction .
notable pirate !
thou thief !
what foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies , whom thou , in terms so bloody and so dear , hast made thine enemies ?
orsino , noble sir , be pleased that i shake off these names you give me antonio never yet was thief or pirate , though i confess , on base and ground enough , orsino enemy .
a witchcraft drew me hither that most ingrateful boy there by your side , from the rude sea enraged and foamy mouth did i redeem , a wreck past hope he was his life i gave him and did thereto add my love , without retention or restraint , all his in dedication , for his sake did i expose myself , pure for his love , into the danger of this adverse town , drew to defend him when he was beset where being apprehended , his false cunning , not meaning to partake with me in danger , taught him to face me out of his acquaintance , and grew a twenty years removed thing while one would wink , denied me mine own purse , which i had recommended to his use not half an hour before .
how can this be ?
when came he to this town ?
, my lord , and for three months before , no interim , not a minute vacancy , both day and night did we keep company .
enter olivia and attendants here comes the countess now heaven walks on earth .
but for thee , fellow , fellow , thy words are madness three months this youth hath tended upon me , but more of that anon .
take him aside .
what would my lord , but that he may not have , wherein olivia may seem serviceable ?
cesario , you do not keep promise with me .
madam !
gracious olivia , what do you say , cesario ?
good my lord , my lord would speak , my duty hushes me .
if it be aught to the old tune , my lord , it is as fat and fulsome to mine ear as howling after music .
still so cruel ?
still so constant , lord .
what , to perverseness ?
you uncivil lady , to whose ingrate and unauspicious altars my soul the offerings hath breathed out that devotion tender !
what shall i do ?
even what it please my lord , that shall become him .
why should i not , had i the heart to do it , like to the egyptian thief at point of death , kill what i love ? a savage jealousy that sometimes savours nobly .
but hear me this since you to cast my faith , and that i partly know the instrument that screws me from my true place in your favour , live you the tyrant still , but this your minion , whom i know you love , and whom , by heaven i swear , i tender dearly , him will i tear out of that cruel eye , where he sits crowned in his master spite .
come , boy , with me , my thoughts are ripe in mischief i sacrifice the lamb that i do love , to spite a raven heart within a dove .
and i , most jocund , apt and willingly , to do you rest , a thousand deaths would die .
where goes cesario ?
after him i love more than i love these eyes , more than my life , more , by all mores , than i shall love wife .
if i do feign , you witnesses above punish my life for tainting of my love !
ay me , detested !
how am i beguiled !
who does beguile you ?
who does do you wrong ?
hast thou forgot thyself ?
is it so long ?
call forth the holy father .
come , away !
whither , my lord ?
cesario , husband , stay .
husband !
ay , husband can he that deny ?
her husband , sirrah !
no , my lord , not i .
alas , it is the baseness of thy fear that makes thee strangle thy propriety fear not , cesario , take thy fortunes up , be that thou thou art , and then thou art as great as that thou .
enter priest o , welcome , father !
father , i charge thee , by thy reverence , here to unfold , though lately we intended to keep in darkness what occasion now reveals before is ripe , what thou dost know hath newly pass between this youth and me .
a contract of eternal bond of love , confirm by mutual joinder of your hands , attested by the holy close of lips , strengthen by interchangement of your rings , and all the ceremony of this compact seal in my function , by my testimony since when , my watch hath told me , toward my grave i have travell but two hours .
o thou dissembling cub !
what wilt thou be when time hath sow a grizzle on thy case ?
or will not else thy craft so quickly grow , that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow ?
farewell , and take her , but direct thy feet where thou and i henceforth may never meet .
my lord , i do protest o , do not swear !
hold little faith , though thou hast too much fear .
enter sir andrew for the love of god , a surgeon !
send one presently to sir toby .
what the matter ?
he has broke my head across and has given sir toby a bloody coxcomb too for the love of god , your help !
i had rather than forty pound i were at home .
who has done this , sir andrew ?
the count gentleman , one cesario we took him for a coward , but he the very devil incardinate .
my gentleman , cesario ?
lifelings , here he is !
you broke my head for nothing , and that that i did , i was set on to by sir toby .
why do you speak to me ?
i never hurt you you drew your sword upon me without cause , but i bespoke you fair , and hurt you not .
if a bloody coxcomb be a hurt , you have hurt me i think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb .
enter sir toby belch and clown here comes sir toby halting , you shall hear more but if he had not been in drink , he would have tickled you othergates than he did .
how now , gentleman !
how with you ?
that all one has hurt me , and there the end o .
sot , didst see dick surgeon , sot ?
o , he drunk , sir toby , an hour agone , his eyes were set at eight i ' the morning .
then he a rogue , and a passy measures panyn i hate a drunken rogue .
away with him !
who hath made this havoc with them ?
i help you , sir toby , because well be dressed together .
will you help ?
an and a coxcomb and a knave , a knave , a gull !
get him to bed , and let his hurt be look to .
exeunt clown , fabian , sir toby belch , and sir andrew enter sebastian i am sorry , madam , i have hurt your kinsman but , had it been the brother of my blood , i must have done no less with wit and safety .
you throw a strange regard upon me , and by that i do perceive it hath offended you pardon me , sweet one , even for the vows we made each other but so late ago .
one face , one voice , one habit , and two persons , a natural perspective , that is and is not !
antonio , o my dear antonio !
how have the hours rack and tortured me , since i have lost thee !
sebastian are you ?
thou that , antonio ?
how have you made division of yourself ?
an apple , cleft in two , is not more twin than these two creatures .
which is sebastian ?
most wonderful !
do i stand there ?
i never had a brother , nor can there be that deity in my nature , of here and every where .
i had a sister , whom the blind waves and surges have devour .
of charity , what kin are you to me ?
what countryman ?
what name ?
what parentage ?
of messaline sebastian was my father , such a sebastian was my brother too , so went he suited to his watery tomb if spirits can assume both form and suit you come to fright us .
a spirit i am indeed , but am in that dimension grossly clad which from the womb i did participate .
were you a woman , as the rest goes even , i should my tears let fall upon your cheek , and say , drowned viola ! '
my father had a mole upon his brow .
and so had mine .
and died that day when viola from her birth had number thirteen years .
o , that record is lively in my soul !
he finished indeed his mortal act that day that made my sister thirteen years .
if nothing lets to make us happy both but this my masculine usurp attire , do not embrace me till each circumstance of place , time , fortune , do cohere and jump that i am viola which to confirm , i bring you to a captain in this town , where lie my maiden weeds , by whose gentle help i was preserved to serve this noble count .
all the occurrence of my fortune since hath been between this lady and this lord .
to olivia so comes it , lady , you have been mistook but nature to her bias drew in that .
you would have been contracted to a maid , nor are you therein , by my life , deceived , you are betroth both to a maid and man .
be not amazed , right noble is his blood .
if this be so , as yet the glass seems true , i shall have share in this most happy wreck .
to viola boy , thou hast said to me a thousand times thou never shouldst love woman like to me .
and all those sayings will i overswear , and those swearings keep as true in soul as doth that orbed continent the fire that severs day from night .
give me thy hand , and let me see thee in thy woman weeds .
the captain that did bring me first on shore hath my maid garments he upon some action is now in durance , at malvolio suit , a gentleman , and follower of my lady .
he shall enlarge him fetch malvolio hither and yet , alas , now i remember me , they say , poor gentleman , he much distract .
clown with a letter , and fabian a most extracting frenzy of mine own from my remembrance clearly banish his .
how does he , sirrah ?
truly , madam , he holds belzebub at the staves end as well as a man in his case may do has here writ a letter to you , i should have give you morning , but as a madman epistles are no gospels , so it skills not much when they are delivered .
ope , and read it .
look then to be well edified when the fool delivers the madman .
reads the lord , madam , ' how now !
art thou mad ?
no , madam , i do but read madness an your ladyship will have it as it ought to be , you must allow vox .
prithee , read i ' thy right wits .
so i do , madonna , but to read his right wits is to read thus therefore perpend , my princess , and give ear .
read it you , sirrah .
to fabian reads the lord , madam , you wrong me , and the world shall know it though you have put me into darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over me , yet have i the benefit of my senses as well as your ladyship .
i have your own letter that induced me to the semblance i put on , with the which i doubt not but to do myself much right , or you much shame .
think of me as you please .
i leave my duty a little unthought of and speak out of my injury .
the malvolio . '
did he write this ?
ay , madam .
this savours not much of distraction .
see him deliver , fabian , bring him hither .
exit fabian my lord so please you , these things further thought on , to think me as well a sister as a wife , one day shall crown the alliance o , so please you , here at my house and at my proper cost .
madam , i am most apt to embrace your offer .
to viola your master quits you , and for your service done him , so much against the mettle of your sex , so far beneath your soft and tender breeding , and since you call me master for so long , here is my hand you shall from this time be your master mistress .
a sister !
you are she .
fabian , with malvolio is this the madman ?
ay , my lord , this same .
how now , malvolio !
madam , you have done me wrong , notorious wrong .
have i , malvolio ?
no .
lady , you have .
pray you , peruse that letter .
you must not now deny it is your hand write from it , if you can , in hand or phrase , or say is not your seal , nor your invention you can say none of this well , grant it then and tell me , in the modesty of honour , why you have given me such clear lights of favour , bade me come smiling and to you , to put on yellow stockings and to frown upon sir toby and the lighter people , and , acting this in an obedient hope , why have you suffer me to be imprison , kept in a dark house , visited by the priest , and made the most notorious geck and gull that invention play on ?
tell me why .
alas , malvolio , this is not my writing , though , i confess , much like the character but out of question is maria hand .
and now i do bethink me , it was she first told me thou wast mad , then camest in smiling , and in such forms which here were presupposed upon thee in the letter .
prithee , be content this practise hath most shrewdly pass upon thee , but when we know the grounds and authors of it , thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge of thine own cause .
good madam , hear me speak , and let no quarrel nor no brawl to come taint the condition of this present hour , which i have wonder at .
in hope it shall not , most freely i confess , myself and toby set this device against malvolio here , upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts we had conceived against him maria writ the letter at sir toby great importance , in recompense whereof he hath married her .
how with a sportful malice it was follow , may rather pluck on laughter than revenge , if that the injuries be justly weigh that have on both sides pass .
alas , poor fool , how have they baffled thee !
why , are born great , some achieve greatness , and some have greatness thrown upon them . '
i was one , sir , in this interlude , one sir topas , sir , but that all one .
the lord , fool , i am not mad . '
but do you remember ?
, why laugh you at such a barren rascal ?
an you smile not , he gagged ' and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges .
i be revenged on the whole pack of you .
exit he hath been most notoriously abused .
pursue him and entreat him to a peace he hath not told us of the captain yet when that is known and golden time convents , a solemn combination shall be made of our dear souls .
meantime , sweet sister , we will not part from hence .
cesario , come , for so you shall be , while you are a man , but when in other habits you are seen , orsino mistress and his fancy queen .
exeunt all , except clown sings when that i was and a little tiny boy , with hey , ho , the wind and the rain , a foolish thing was but a toy , for the rain it raineth every day .
but when i came to man estate , with hey , ho , and knaves and thieves men shut their gate , for the rain , and but when i came , alas !
to wive , with hey , ho , and by swaggering could i never thrive , for the rain , and but when i came unto my beds , with hey , ho , and with still had drunken heads , for the rain , and a great while ago the world begun , with hey , ho , and but that all one , our play is done , and we strive to please you every day .

enter valentine and proteus cease to persuade , my loving proteus youth have ever homely wits .
not affection chains thy tender days to the sweet glances of thy honour love , i rather would entreat thy company to see the wonders of the world abroad , than , living dully sluggardized at home , wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness .
but since thou lovest , love still and thrive therein , even as i would when i to love begin .
wilt thou be gone ?
sweet valentine , adieu !
think on thy proteus , when thou haply seest some rare object in thy travel wish me partaker in thy happiness when thou dost meet good hap , and in thy danger , if ever danger do environ thee , commend thy grievance to my holy prayers , for i will be thy beadsman , valentine .
and on a pray for my success ?
upon some book i love i pray for thee .
that on some shallow story of deep love how young leander cross the hellespont .
that a deep story of a deeper love for he was more than over shoes in love .
is true , for you are over boots in love , and yet you never swum the hellespont .
over the boots ?
nay , give me not the boots .
no , i will not , for it boots thee not .
what ?
to be in love , where scorn is bought with groans , coy looks with sighs , one fading moment mirth with twenty watchful , weary , tedious nights if haply won , perhaps a hapless gain , if lost , why then a grievous labour won , however , but a folly bought with wit , or else a wit by folly vanquished .
so , by your circumstance , you call me fool .
so , by your circumstance , i fear you prove .
is love you cavil at i am not love .
love is your master , for he masters you and he that is so yoked by a fool , methinks , should not be chronicled for wise .
yet writers say , as in the sweetest bud the eating canker dwells , so eating love inhabits in the finest wits of all .
and writers say , as the most forward bud is eaten by the canker ere it blow , even so by love the young and tender wit is turn to folly , blasting in the bud , losing his verdure even in the prime and all the fair effects of future hopes .
but wherefore waste i time to counsel thee , that art a votary to fond desire ?
once more adieu !
my father at the road expects my coming , there to see me shipp .
and thither will i bring thee , valentine .
sweet proteus , no , now let us take our leave .
to milan let me hear from thee by letters of thy success in love , and what news else betideth here in absence of thy friend , and likewise will visit thee with mine .
all happiness bechance to thee in milan !
as much to you at home !
and so , farewell .
exit he after honour hunts , i after love he leaves his friends to dignify them more , i leave myself , my friends and all , for love .
thou , julia , thou hast metamorphosed me , made me neglect my studies , lose my time , war with good counsel , set the world at nought , made wit with musing weak , heart sick with thought .
enter speed sir proteus , save you !
saw you my master ?
but now he parted hence , to embark for milan .
twenty to one then he is shipp already , and i have play the sheep in losing him .
indeed , a sheep doth very often stray , an if the shepherd be a while away .
you conclude that my master is a shepherd , then , and i a sheep ?
i do .
why then , my horns are his horns , whether i wake or sleep .
a silly answer and fitting well a sheep .
this proves me still a sheep .
true , and thy master a shepherd .
nay , that i can deny by a circumstance .
it shall go hard but i prove it by another .
the shepherd seeks the sheep , and not the sheep the shepherd , but i seek my master , and my master seeks not me therefore i am no sheep .
the sheep for fodder follow the shepherd , the shepherd for food follows not the sheep thou for wages followest thy master , thy master for wages follows not thee therefore thou art a sheep .
such another proof will make me cry . '
but , dost thou hear ?
gavest thou my letter to julia ?
ay sir i , a lost mutton , gave your letter to her , a laced mutton , and she , a laced mutton , gave me , a lost mutton , nothing for my labour .
here too small a pasture for such store of muttons .
if the ground be overcharged , you were best stick her .
nay in that you are astray , best pound you .
nay , sir , less than a pound shall serve me for carrying your letter .
you mistake , i mean the pound , a pinfold .
from a pound to a pin ?
fold it over and over , is threefold too little for carrying a letter to your lover .
but what said she ?
first nodding ay .
nod ay why , that noddy .
you mistook , sir , i say , she did nod and you ask me if she did nod , and i say , . '
and that set together is noddy .
now you have taken the pains to set it together , take it for your pains .
no , no , you shall have it for bearing the letter .
well , i perceive i must be fain to bear with you .
why sir , how do you bear with me ?
marry , sir , the letter , very orderly , having nothing but the word ' for my pains .
beshrew me , but you have a quick wit .
and yet it can not overtake your slow purse .
come come , open the matter in brief what said she ?
open your purse , that the money and the matter may be both at once delivered .
well , sir , here is for your pains .
what said she ?
truly , sir , i think you hardly win her .
why , couldst thou perceive so much from her ?
sir , i could perceive nothing at all from her , no , not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter and being so hard to me that brought your mind , i fear she prove as hard to you in telling your mind .
give her no token but stones , for she as hard as steel .
what said she ?
nothing ?
no , not so much as this for thy pains . '
to testify your bounty , i thank you , you have testerned me , in requital whereof , henceforth carry your letters yourself and so , sir , i commend you to my master .
go , go , be gone , to save your ship from wreck , which can not perish having thee aboard , being destined to a drier death on shore .
exit speed i must go send some better messenger i fear my julia would not deign my lines , receiving them from such a worthless post .
exit scene ii .
the same .
garden of julia house .
enter julla and lucetta but say , lucetta , now we are alone , wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love ?
ay , madam , so you stumble not unheedfully .
of all the fair resort of gentlemen that every day with parle encounter me , in thy opinion which is worthiest love ?
please you repeat their names , i show my mind according to my shallow simple skill .
what thou of the fair sir eglamour ?
as of a knight , neat and fine , but , were i you , he never should be mine .
what thou of the rich mercatio ?
well of his wealth , but of himself , so so .
what thou of the gentle proteus ?
lord , lord !
to see what folly reigns in us !
how now !
what means this passion at his name ?
pardon , dear madam is a passing shame that i , unworthy body as i am , should censure thus on lovely gentlemen .
why not on proteus , as of all the rest ?
then thus of many good i think him best .
your reason ?
i have no other , but a woman reason , i think him so because i think him so .
and wouldst thou have me cast my love on him ?
ay , if you thought your love not cast away .
why he , of all the rest , hath never moved me .
yet he , of all the rest , i think , best loves ye .
his little speaking shows his love but small .
fire that closest kept burns most of all .
they do not love that do not show their love .
o , they love least that let men know their love .
i would i knew his mind .
peruse this paper , madam .
julia . '
say , from whom ?
that the contents will show .
say , say , who gave it thee ?
valentine page , and sent , i think , from proteus .
he would have given it you , but i , being in the way , did in your name receive it pardon the fault i pray .
now , by my modesty , a goodly broker !
dare you presume to harbour wanton lines ?
to whisper and conspire against my youth ?
now , trust me , is an office of great worth and you an officer fit for the place .
or else return no more into my sight .
to plead for love deserves more fee than hate .
will ye be gone ?
that you may ruminate .
exit and yet i would i had the letter it were a shame to call her back again and pray her to a fault for which i chid her .
what a fool is she , that knows i am a maid , and would not force the letter to my view !
since maids , in modesty , say ' to that which they would have the profferer construe . '
fie , fie , how wayward is this foolish love that , like a testy babe , will scratch the nurse and presently all humbled kiss the rod !
how churlishly i chid lucetta hence , when willingly i would have had her here !
how angerly i taught my brow to frown , when inward joy enforced my heart to smile !
my penance is to call lucetta back and ask remission for my folly past .
what ho !
lucetta !
lucetta what would your ladyship ?
near ?
i would it were , that you might kill your stomach on your meat and not upon your maid .
what that you took up so gingerly ?
nothing .
why didst thou stoop , then ?
to take a paper up that i let fall .
and is that paper nothing ?
nothing concerning me .
then let it lie for those that it concerns .
madam , it will not lie where it concerns unless it have a false interpeter .
some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme .
that i might sing it , madam , to a tune .
give me a note your ladyship can set .
as little by such toys as may be possible .
best sing it to the tune of o ' love . '
it is too heavy for so light a tune .
heavy !
belike it hath some burden then ?
ay , and melodious were it , would you sing it .
and why not you ?
i can not reach so high .
let see your song .
how now , minion !
keep tune there still , so you will sing it out and yet methinks i do not like this tune .
you do not ?
no , madam , it is too sharp .
you , minion , are too saucy .
nay , now you are too flat and mar the concord with too harsh a descant there wanteth but a mean to fill your song .
the mean is drown with your unruly bass .
indeed , i bid the base for proteus .
this babble shall not henceforth trouble me .
here is a coil with protestation !
tears the letter go get you gone , and let the papers lie you would be fingering them , to anger me .
she makes it strange , but she would be best pleased to be so anger with another letter .
exit nay , would i were so anger with the same !
o hateful hands , to tear such loving words !
injurious wasps , to feed on such sweet honey and kill the bees that yield it with your stings !
i kiss each several paper for amends .
look , here is writ julia . '
unkind julia !
as in revenge of thy ingratitude , i throw thy name against the bruising stones , trampling contemptuously on thy disdain .
and here is writ proteus . '
poor wounded name !
my bosom as a bed shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal , and thus i search it with a sovereign kiss .
but twice or thrice was ' written down .
be calm , good wind , blow not a word away till i have found each letter in the letter , except mine own name that some whirlwind bear unto a ragged rock and throw it thence into the raging sea !
lo , here in one line is his name twice writ , forlorn proteus , passionate proteus , to the sweet julia ' that i tear away .
and yet i will not , sith so prettily he couples it to his complaining names .
thus will i fold them one on another now kiss , embrace , contend , do what you will .
lucetta madam , dinner is ready , and your father stays .
well , let us go .
what , shall these papers lie like here ?
if you respect them , best to take them up .
nay , i was taken up for laying them down yet here they shall not lie , for catching cold .
i see you have a month mind to them .
ay , madam , you may say what sights you see , i see things too , although you judge i wink .
come , come , please you go ?

antonio house .
enter antonio and panthino tell me , panthino , what sad talk was that wherewith my brother held you in the cloister ?
was of his nephew proteus , your son .
why , what of him ?
he wonder that your lordship would suffer him to spend his youth at home , while other men , of slender reputation , put forth their sons to seek preferment out some to the wars , to try their fortune there , some to discover islands far away , some to the studious universities .
for any or for all these exercises , he said that proteus your son was meet , and did request me to importune you to let him spend his time no more at home , which would be great impeachment to his age , in having known no travel in his youth .
nor thou much importune me to that whereon this month i have been hammering .
i have consider well his loss of time and how he can not be a perfect man , not being tried and tutor in the world experience is by industry achieved and perfected by the swift course of time .
then tell me , whither were i best to send him ?
i think your lordship is not ignorant how his companion , youthful valentine , attends the emperor in his royal court .
i know it well .
good , i think , your lordship sent him thither there shall he practise tilts and tournaments , hear sweet discourse , converse with noblemen .
and be in eye of every exercise worthy his youth and nobleness of birth .
i like thy counsel , well hast thou advised and that thou mayst perceive how well i like it , the execution of it shall make known .
even with the speediest expedition i will dispatch him to the emperor court .
, may it please you , don alphonso , with other gentlemen of good esteem , are journeying to salute the emperor and to commend their service to his will .
good company , with them shall proteus go and , in good time !
now will we break with him .
enter proteus sweet love !
sweet lines !
sweet life !
here is her hand , the agent of her heart , here is her oath for love , her honour pawn .
o , that our fathers would applaud our loves , to seal our happiness with their consents !
o heavenly julia !
how now !
what letter are you reading there ?
please your lordship , is a word or two of commendations sent from valentine , deliver by a friend that came from him .
lend me the letter , let me see what news .
there is no news , my lord , but that he writes how happily he lives , how well beloved and daily graced by the emperor , wishing me with him , partner of his fortune .
and how stand you affected to his wish ?
as one relying on your lordship will and not depending on his friendly wish .
my will is something sorted with his wish .
muse not that i thus suddenly proceed , for what i will , i will , and there an end .
i am resolved that thou shalt spend some time with valentinus in the emperor court what maintenance he from his friends receives , like exhibition thou shalt have from me .
be in readiness to go excuse it not , for i am peremptory .
my lord , i can not be so soon provided please you , deliberate a day or two .
look , what thou shall be sent after thee no more of stay !
thou must go .
come on , panthino you shall be employ to hasten on his expedition .
exeunt antonio and panthino thus have i shunn the fire for fear of burning , and drench me in the sea , where i am drown .
i fear to show my father julia letter , lest he should take exceptions to my love , and with the vantage of mine own excuse hath he excepted most against my love .
o , how this spring of love resembleth the uncertain glory of an april day , which now shows all the beauty of the sun , and by and by a cloud takes all away !
panthino sir proteus , your father calls for you he is in haste , therefore , i pray you to go .
why , this it is my heart accords thereto , and yet a thousand times it answers . '

not mine , my gloves are on .
why , then , this may be yours , for this is but one .
ha !
let me see ay , give it me , it mine sweet ornament that decks a thing divine !
ah , silvia , silvia !
madam silvia !
madam silvia !
how now , sirrah ?
she is not within hearing , sir .
why , sir , who bade you call her ?
your worship , sir , or else i mistook .
well , you still be too forward .
and yet i was last chidden for being too slow .
go to , sir tell me , do you know madam silvia ?
she that your worship loves ?
why , how know you that i am in love ?
marry , by these special marks first , you have learned , like sir proteus , to wreathe your arms , like a malecontent , to relish a , like a , to walk alone , like one that had the pestilence , to sigh , like a that had lost his a b c , to weep , like a young wench that had buried her grandam , to fast , like one that takes diet , to watch like one that fears robbing , to speak puling , like a beggar at hallowmas .
you were wont , when you laughed , to crow like a cock , when you walked , to walk like one of the lions , when you fasted , it was presently after dinner , when you looked sadly , it was for want of money and now you are metamorphosed with a mistress , that , when i look on you , i can hardly think you my master .
are all these things perceived in me ?
they are all perceived without ye .
without me ?
they can not .
without you ?
nay , that certain , for , without you were so simple , none else would but you are so without these follies , that these follies are within you and shine through you like the water in an urinal , that not an eye that sees you but is a physician to comment on your malady .
but tell me , dost thou know my lady silvia ?
she that you gaze on so as she sits at supper ?
hast thou observed that ?
even she , i mean .
why , sir , i know her not .
dost thou know her by my gazing on her , and yet knowest her not ?
is she not , sir ?
not so fair , boy , as .
sir , i know that well enough .
what dost thou know ?
that she is not so fair as , of you , .
i mean that her beauty is exquisite , but her favour infinite .
that because the one is painted and the other out of all count .
how painted ?
and how out of count ?
marry , sir , so painted , to make her fair , that no man counts of her beauty .
how esteemest thou me ?
i account of her beauty .
you never saw her since she was deformed .
how long hath she been deformed ?
ever since you loved her .
i have loved her ever since i saw her , and still i see her beautiful .
if you love her , you can not see her .
why ?
because love is blind .
o , that you had mine eyes , or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to have when you chid at sir proteus for going ungartered !
what should i see then ?
your own present folly and her passing deformity for he , being in love , could not see to garter his hose , and you , being in love , can not see to put on your hose .
belike , boy , then , you are in love , for last morning you could not see to wipe my shoes .
true , sir , i was in love with my bed i thank you , you swinged me for my love , which makes me the bolder to chide you for yours .
in conclusion , i stand affected to her .
i would you were set , so your affection would cease .
last night she enjoined me to write some lines to one she loves .
and have you ?
i have .
are they not lamely writ ?
no , boy , but as well as i can do them .
peace !
here she comes .
aside o excellent motion !
o exceeding puppet !
now will he interpret to her .
enter silvia madam and mistress , a thousand .
aside o , give ye good even !
here a million of manners .
sir valentine and servant , to you two thousand .
aside he should give her interest and she gives it him .
as you enjoin me , i have writ your letter unto the secret nameless friend of yours , which i was much unwilling to proceed in but for my duty to your ladyship .
i thank you gentle servant is very clerkly done .
now trust me , madam , it came hardly off , for being ignorant to whom it goes i writ at random , very doubtfully .
perchance you think too much of so much pains ?
no , madam , so it stead you , i will write please you command , a thousand times as much , and yet a pretty period !
well , i guess the sequel , and yet i will not name it , and yet i care not , and yet take this again , and yet i thank you , meaning henceforth to trouble you no more .
aside and yet you will , and yet another . '
what means your ladyship ?
do you not like it ?
yes , yes , the lines are very quaintly writ , but since unwillingly , take them again .
nay , take them .
madam , they are for you .
ay , ay you writ them , sir , at my request , but i will none of them , they are for you , i would have had them writ more movingly .
please you , i write your ladyship another .
and when it writ , for my sake read it over , and if it please you , so , if not , why , so .
if it please me , madam , what then ?
why , if it please you , take it for your labour and so , good morrow , servant .
exit o jest unseen , inscrutable , invisible , as a nose on a man face , or a weathercock on a steeple !
my master sues to her , and she hath taught her suitor , he being her pupil , to become her tutor .
o excellent device !
was there ever heard a better , that my master , being scribe , to himself should write the letter ?
how now , sir ?
what are you reasoning with yourself ?
nay , i was rhyming is you that have the reason .
to do what ?
to be a spokesman for madam silvia .
to whom ?
to yourself why , she wooes you by a figure .
what figure ?
by a letter , i should say .
why , she hath not writ to me ?
what need she , when she hath made you write to yourself ?
why , do you not perceive the jest ?
no , believe me .
no believing you , indeed , sir .
but did you perceive her earnest ?
she gave me none , except an angry word .
why , she hath given you a letter .
that the letter i writ to her friend .
and that letter hath she delivered , and there an end .
i would it were no worse .
i warrant you , is as well for often have you writ to her , and she , in modesty , or else for want of idle time , could not again reply , or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover , herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover .
all this i speak in print , for in print i found it .
why muse you , sir ?
is .
i have dined .
ay , but hearken , sir , though the chameleon love can feed on the air , i am one that am nourished by my victuals , and would fain have meat .
o , be not like your mistress , be moved , be moved .

i think crab , my dog , be the dog that lives my mother weeping , my father wailing , my sister crying , our maid howling , our cat wringing her hands , and all our house in a great perplexity , yet did not this cur shed one tear he is a stone , a very pebble stone , and has no more pity in him than a dog a jew would have wept to have seen our parting , why , my grandam , having no eyes , look you , wept herself blind at my parting .
nay , i show you the manner of it .
this shoe is my father no , this left shoe is my father no , no , this left shoe is my mother nay , that can not be so neither yes , it is so , it is so , it hath the worser sole .

for fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue .
where should i lose my tongue ?

in thy tail !
lose the tide , and the voyage , and the master , and the service , and the tied !

what seem i that i am not ?
wise .
what instance of the contrary ?
your folly .
and how quote you my folly ?
i quote it in your jerkin .
my jerkin is a doublet .
well , then , i double your folly .
how ?
what , angry , sir thurio !
do you change colour ?
give him leave , madam , he is a kind of chameleon .
that hath more mind to feed on your blood than live in your air .
you have said , sir .
ay , sir , and done too , for this time .
i know it well , sir , you always end ere you begin .
a fine volley of words , gentlemen , and quickly shot off .
is indeed , madam , we thank the giver .
who is that , servant ?
yourself , sweet lady , for you gave the fire .
sir thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship looks , and spends what he borrows kindly in your company .
sir , if you spend word for word with me , i shall make your wit bankrupt .
i know it well , sir , you have an exchequer of words , and , i think , no other treasure to give your followers , for it appears by their bare liveries , that they live by your bare words .
no more , gentlemen , no more here comes my father .
enter duke now , daughter silvia , you are hard beset .
sir valentine , your father in good health what say you to a letter from your friends of much good news ?
my lord , i will be thankful .
to any happy messenger from thence .
know ye don antonio , your countryman ?
ay , my good lord , i know the gentleman to be of worth and worthy estimation and not without desert so well reputed .
hath he not a son ?
ay , my good lord , a son that well deserves the honour and regard of such a father .
you know him well ?
i know him as myself , for from our infancy we have conversed and spent our hours together and though myself have been an idle truant , omitting the sweet benefit of time to clothe mine age with perfection , yet hath sir proteus , for that his name , made use and fair advantage of his days , his years but young , but his experience old , his head unmellow , but his judgment ripe , and , in a word , for far behind his worth comes all the praises that i now bestow , he is complete in feature and in mind with all good grace to grace a gentleman .
beshrew me , sir , but if he make this good , he is as worthy for an empress ' love as meet to be an emperor counsellor .
well , sir , this gentleman is come to me , with commendation from great potentates , and here he means to spend his time awhile i think is no unwelcome news to you .
should i have wish a thing , it had been he .
welcome him then according to his worth .
silvia , i speak to you , and you , sir thurio , for valentine , i need not cite him to it i will send him hither to you presently .
exit this is the gentleman i told your ladyship had come along with me , but that his mistress did hold his eyes lock in her crystal looks .
belike that now she hath enfranchised them upon some other pawn for fealty .
nay , sure , i think she holds them prisoners still .
nay , then he should be blind , and , being blind how could he see his way to seek out you ?
why , lady , love hath twenty pair of eyes .
they say that love hath not an eye at all .
to see such lovers , thurio , as yourself upon a homely object love can wink .
have done , have done , here comes the gentleman .
exit thurio enter proteus welcome , dear proteus !
mistress , i beseech you , confirm his welcome with some special favour .
his worth is warrant for his welcome hither , if this be he you oft have wish to hear from .
mistress , it is sweet lady , entertain him to be my to your ladyship .
too low a mistress for so high a servant .
not so , sweet lady but too mean a servant to have a look of such a worthy mistress .
leave off discourse of disability sweet lady , entertain him for your servant .
my duty will i boast of , nothing else .
and duty never yet did want his meed servant , you are welcome to a worthless mistress .
i die on him that says so but yourself .
that you are welcome ?
that you are worthless .
thurio madam , my lord your father would speak with you .
i wait upon his pleasure .
come , sir thurio , go with me .
once more , new servant , welcome i leave you to confer of home affairs , when you have done , we look to hear from you .
we both attend upon your ladyship .
exeunt silvia and thurio now , tell me , how do all from whence you came ?
your friends are well and have them much commended .
and how do yours ?
i left them all in health .
how does your lady ?
and how thrives your love ?
my tales of love were wont to weary you , i know you joy not in a love discourse .
ay , proteus , but that life is alter now i have done penance for contemning love , whose high imperious thoughts have punish me with bitter fasts , with penitential groans , with nightly tears and daily sighs , for in revenge of my contempt of love , love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes and made them watchers of mine own heart sorrow .
o gentle proteus , love a mighty lord , and hath so humbled me , as , i confess , there is no woe to his correction , nor to his service no such joy on earth .
now no discourse , except it be of love , now can i break my fast , dine , sup and sleep , upon the very naked name of love .
enough , i read your fortune in your eye .
was this the idol that you worship so ?
even she , and is she not a heavenly saint ?
no , but she is an earthly paragon .
call her divine .
i will not flatter her .
o , flatter me , for love delights in praises .
when i was sick , you gave me bitter pills , and i must minister the like to you .
then speak the truth by her , if not divine , yet let her be a principality , sovereign to all the creatures on the earth .
except my mistress .
sweet , except not any , except thou wilt except against my love .
have i not reason to prefer mine own ?
and i will help thee to prefer her too she shall be dignified with this high honour to bear my lady train , lest the base earth should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss and , of so great a favour growing proud , disdain to root the flower and make rough winter everlastingly .
why , valentine , what braggardism is this ?
pardon me , proteus all i can is nothing to her whose worth makes other worthies nothing , she is alone .
then let her alone .
not for the world why , man , she is mine own , and i as rich in having such a jewel as twenty seas , if all their sand were pearl , the water nectar and the rocks pure gold .
forgive me that i do not dream on thee , because thou me dote upon my love .
my foolish rival , that her father likes only for his possessions are so huge , is gone with her along , and i must after , for love , thou , is full of jealousy .
but she loves you ?
ay , and we are betroth nay , more , our , , with all the cunning manner of our flight , determined of , how i must climb her window , the ladder made of cords , and all the means plotted and on for my happiness .
good proteus , go with me to my chamber , in these affairs to aid me with thy counsel .
go on before , i shall inquire you forth i must unto the road , to disembark some necessaries that i needs must use , and then i presently attend you .
will you make haste ?
i will .
exit valentine even as one heat another heat expels , or as one nail by strength drives out another , so the remembrance of my former love is by a newer object quite forgotten .
is it mine , or valentine praise , her true perfection , or my false transgression , that makes me reasonless to reason thus ?
she is fair , and so is julia that i love that i did love , for now my love is thaw , which , like a waxen image , a fire , bears no impression of the thing it was .
methinks my zeal to valentine is cold , and that i love him not as i was wont .
o , but i love his lady too too much , and that the reason i love him so little .
how shall i dote on her with more advice , that thus without advice begin to love her !
is but her picture i have yet beheld , and that hath dazzled my reason light , but when i look on her perfections , there is no reason but i shall be blind .
if i can cheque my erring love , i will , if not , to compass her i use my skill .

by mine honesty , welcome to milan !
forswear not thyself , sweet youth , for i am not welcome .
i reckon this always , that a man is never undone till he be hanged , nor never welcome to a place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess say ! '
come on , you madcap , i to the alehouse with you presently , where , for one shot of five pence , thou shalt have five thousand welcomes .
but , sirrah , how did thy master part with madam julia ?
marry , after they closed in earnest , they parted very fairly in jest .
but shall she marry him ?
no .
how then ?
shall he marry her ?
no , neither .
what , are they broken ?
no , they are both as whole as a fish .
why , then , how stands the matter with them ?
marry , thus when it stands well with him , it stands well with her .
what an ass art thou !
i understand thee not .
what a block art thou , that thou canst not !
my staff understands me .
what thou sayest ?
ay , and what i do too look thee , i but lean , and my staff understands me .
it stands under thee , indeed .
why , and is all one .
but tell me true , be a match ?
ask my dog if he say ay , it will !
if he say no , it will , if he shake his tail and say nothing , it will .
the conclusion is then that it will .
thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable .
is well that i get it so .
but , launce , how sayest thou , that my master is become a notable lover ?
i never knew him otherwise .
than how ?
a notable lubber , as thou reportest him to be .
why , thou whoreson ass , thou mistakest me .
why , fool , i meant not thee , i meant thy master .
i tell thee , my master is become a hot lover .
why , i tell thee , i care not though he burn himself in love .
if thou wilt , go with me to the alehouse , if not , thou art an hebrew , a jew , and not worth the name of a christian .
why ?
because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to go to the ale with a christian .
wilt thou go ?
at thy service .

enter proteus to leave my julia , shall i be forsworn , to love fair silvia , shall i be forsworn , to wrong my friend , i shall be much forsworn , and even that power which gave me first my oath provokes me to this threefold perjury , love bade me swear and love bids me forswear .
o love , if thou hast sinned , teach me , thy tempted subject , to excuse it !
at first i did adore a twinkling star , but now i worship a celestial sun .
unheedful vows may heedfully be broken , and he wants wit that wants resolved will to learn his wit to exchange the bad for better .
fie , fie , unreverend tongue !
to call her bad , whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr with twenty thousand oaths .
i can not leave to love , and yet i do , but there i leave to love where i should love .
julia i lose and valentine i lose if i keep them , i needs must lose myself , if i lose them , thus find i by their loss for valentine myself , for julia silvia .
i to myself am dearer than a friend , for love is still most precious in itself , and silvia witness heaven , that made her fair ! shows julia but a swarthy ethiope .
i will forget that julia is alive , remembering that my love to her is dead , and valentine i hold an enemy , aiming at silvia as a sweeter friend .
i can not now prove constant to myself , without some treachery used to valentine .
this night he meaneth with a corded ladder to climb celestial silvia , myself in counsel , his competitor .
now presently i give her father notice of their disguising and pretended flight , who , all enraged , will banish valentine , for thurio , he intends , shall wed his daughter , but , valentine being gone , i quickly cross by some sly trick blunt thurio dull proceeding .

alas , the way is wearisome and long !
a pilgrim is not weary to measure kingdoms with his feeble steps , much less shall she that hath love wings to fly , and when the flight is made to one so dear , of such divine perfection , as sir proteus .
better forbear till proteus make return .
o , thou not his looks are my soul food ?
pity the dearth that i have pined in , by longing for that food so long a time .
didst thou but know the inly touch of love , thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow as seek to quench the fire of love with words .
i do not seek to quench your love hot fire , but qualify the fire extreme rage , lest it should burn above the bounds of reason .
the more thou it up , the more it burns .
the current that with gentle murmur glides , thou , being stopp , impatiently doth rage , but when his fair course is not hindered , he makes sweet music with the stones , giving a gentle kiss to every sedge he overtaketh in his pilgrimage , and so by many winding nooks he strays with willing sport to the wild ocean .
then let me go and hinder not my course i be as patient as a gentle stream and make a pastime of each weary step , till the last step have brought me to my love , and there i rest , as after much turmoil a blessed soul doth in elysium .
but in what habit will you go along ?
not like a woman , for i would prevent the loose encounters of lascivious men gentle lucetta , fit me with such weeds as may beseem some page .
why , then , your ladyship must cut your hair .
no , girl , i knit it up in silken strings with twenty knots .
to be fantastic may become a youth of greater time than i shall show to be .
what fashion , madam shall i make your breeches ?
that fits as well as me , good my lord , what compass will you wear your farthingale ? '
why even what fashion thou best likest , lucetta .
you must needs have them with a codpiece , madam .
out , out , lucetta !
that would be .
a round hose , madam , now not worth a pin , unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on .
lucetta , as thou lovest me , let me have what thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly .
but tell me , wench , how will the world repute me for undertaking so unstaid a journey ?
i fear me , it will make me scandalized .
if you think so , then stay at home and go not .
nay , that i will not .
then never dream on infamy , but go .
if proteus like your journey when you come , no matter who displeased when you are gone i fear me , he will scarce be pleased withal .
that is the least , lucetta , of my fear a thousand oaths , an ocean of his tears and instances of infinite of love warrant me welcome to my proteus .
all these are servants to deceitful men .
base men , that use them to so base effect !
but truer stars did govern proteus ' birth his words are bonds , his oaths are oracles , his love sincere , his thoughts immaculate , his tears pure messengers sent from his heart , his heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth .
pray heaven he prove so , when you come to him !
now , as thou lovest me , do him not that wrong to bear a hard opinion of his truth only deserve my love by loving him , and presently go with me to my chamber , to take a note of what i stand in need of , to furnish me upon my longing journey .
all that is mine i leave at thy dispose , my goods , my lands , my reputation , only , in lieu thereof , dispatch me hence .
come , answer not , but to it presently !
i am impatient of my tarriance .
exeunt act iii scene milan .
the duke palace .
enter duke , thurio , and proteus sir thurio , give us leave , i pray , awhile , we have some secrets to confer about .
exit thurio now , tell me , proteus , what your will with me ?
my gracious lord , that which i would discover the law of friendship bids me to conceal , but when i call to mind your gracious favours done to me , undeserving as i am , my duty pricks me on to utter that which else no worldly good should draw from me .
know , worthy prince , sir valentine , my friend , this night intends to steal away your daughter myself am one made privy to the plot .
i know you have determined to bestow her on thurio , whom your gentle daughter hates , and should she thus be away from you , it would be much vexation to your age .
thus , for my duty sake , i rather chose to cross my friend in his intended drift than , by concealing it , heap on your head a pack of sorrows which would press you down , being unprevented , to your timeless grave .
proteus , i thank thee for thine honest care , which to requite , command me while i live .
this love of theirs myself have often seen , haply when they have judged me fast asleep , and oftentimes have purposed to forbid sir valentine her company and my court but fearing lest my jealous aim might err and so unworthily disgrace the man , a rashness that i ever yet have shunn , i gave him gentle looks , thereby to find that which thyself hast now disclosed to me .
and , that thou mayst perceive my fear of this , knowing that tender youth is soon suggested , i nightly lodge her in an upper tower , the key whereof myself have ever kept , and thence she can not be convey away .
know , noble lord , they have devised a mean how he her will ascend and with a corded ladder fetch her down , for which the youthful lover now is gone and this way comes he with it presently , where , if it please you , you may intercept him .
but , good my lord , do it so cunningly that my discovery be not aimed at , for love of you , not hate unto my friend , hath made me publisher of this pretence .
upon mine honour , he shall never know that i had any light from thee of this .
adieu , my lord , sir valentine is coming .
exit enter valentine sir valentine , whither away so fast ?
please it your grace , there is a messenger that stays to bear my letters to my friends , and i am going to deliver them .
be they of much import ?
the tenor of them doth but signify my health and happy being at your court .
nay then , no matter , stay with me awhile , i am to break with thee of some affairs that touch me near , wherein thou must be secret .
is not unknown to thee that i have sought to match my friend sir thurio to my daughter .
i know it well , my lord , and , sure , the match were rich and honourable , besides , the gentleman is full of virtue , bounty , worth and qualities beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter can not your grace win her to fancy him ?
no , trust me , she is peevish , sullen , froward , proud , disobedient , stubborn , lacking duty , neither regarding that she is my child nor fearing me as if i were her father , and , may i say to thee , this pride of hers , upon advice , hath drawn my love from her , and , where i thought the remnant of mine age should have been cherish by her duty , i now am full resolved to take a wife and turn her out to who will take her in then let her beauty be her , for me and my possessions she esteems not .
what would your grace have me to do in this ?
there is a lady in verona here whom i affect , but she is nice and coy and nought esteems my aged eloquence now therefore would i have thee to my tutor for long agone i have forgot to court , besides , the fashion of the time is changed how and which way i may bestow myself to be regarded in her eye .
win her with gifts , if she respect not words dumb jewels often in their silent kind more than quick words do move a woman mind .
but she did scorn a present that i sent her .
a woman sometimes scorns what best contents her .
send her another , never give her , for scorn at first makes the more .
if she do frown , is not in hate of you , but rather to beget more love in you if she do chide , is not to have you gone , for why , the fools are mad , if left alone .
take no repulse , whatever she doth say , for you gone , ' she doth not mean ! '
flatter and praise , commend , extol their graces , though so black , say they have angels ' faces .
that man that hath a tongue , i say , is no man , if with his tongue he can not win a woman .
but she i mean is promised by her friends unto a youthful gentleman of worth , and kept severely from resort of men , that no man hath access by day to her .
why , then , i would resort to her by night .
ay , but the doors be lock and keys kept safe , that no man hath recourse to her by night .
what lets but one may enter at her window ?
her chamber is aloft , far from the ground , and built so shelving that one can not climb it without apparent hazard of his life .
why then , a ladder quaintly made of cords , to cast up , with a pair of anchoring hooks , would serve to scale another hero tower , so bold leander would adventure it .
now , as thou art a gentleman of blood , advise me where i may have such a ladder .
when would you use it ?
pray , sir , tell me that .
this very night , for love is like a child , that longs for every thing that he can come by .
by seven i get you such a ladder .
but , hark thee , i will go to her alone how shall i best convey the ladder thither ?
it will be light , my lord , that you may bear it under a cloak that is of any length .
a cloak as long as thine will serve the turn ?
ay , my good lord .
then let me see thy cloak i get me one of such another length .
why , any cloak will serve the turn , my lord .
how shall i fashion me to wear a cloak ?
i pray thee , let me feel thy cloak upon me .
what letter is this same ?
what here ?
silvia ' !
and here an engine fit for my proceeding .
i be so bold to break the seal for once .
reads thoughts do harbour with my silvia nightly , and slaves they are to me that send them flying o , could their master come and go as lightly , himself would lodge where senseless they are lying !
my herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them while i , their king , that hither them importune , do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless them , because myself do want my servants ' fortune i curse myself , for they are sent by me , that they should harbour where their lord would be . '
what here ?
, this night i will enfranchise thee . '
is so , and here the ladder for the purpose .
why , phaeton , for thou art merops ' son , wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car and with thy daring folly burn the world ?
wilt thou reach stars , because they shine on thee ?
go , base intruder !
overweening slave !
bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates , and think my patience , more than thy desert , is privilege for thy departure hence thank me for this more than for all the favours which all too much i have bestow on thee .
but if thou linger in my territories longer than swiftest expedition will give thee time to leave our royal court , by heaven !
my wrath shall far exceed the love i ever bore my daughter or thyself .
be gone !
i will not hear thy vain excuse , but , as thou lovest thy life , make speed from hence .
exit and why not death rather than living torment ?
to die is to be banish from myself , and silvia is myself banish from her is self from self a deadly banishment !
what light is light , if silvia be not seen ?
what joy is joy , if silvia be not by ?
unless it be to think that she is by and feed upon the shadow of perfection except i be by silvia in the night , there is no music in the nightingale , unless i look on silvia in the day , there is no day for me to look upon , she is my essence , and i leave to be , if i be not by her fair influence foster , illumined , cherish , kept alive .
i fly not death , to fly his deadly doom tarry i here , i but attend on death but , fly i hence , i fly away from life .
enter proteus and launce run , boy , run , run , and seek him out .
soho , soho !
what seest thou ?
him we go to find there not a hair on head but is a valentine .
valentine ?
no .
who then ?
his spirit ?
neither .
what then ?
nothing .
can nothing speak ?
master , shall i strike ?
who wouldst thou strike ?
nothing .
villain , forbear .
why , sir , i strike nothing i pray you , sirrah , i say , forbear .
friend valentine , a word .
my ears are stopt and can not hear good news , so much of bad already hath possess them .
then in dumb silence will i bury mine , for they are harsh , untuneable and bad .
is silvia dead ?
no , valentine .
no valentine , indeed , for sacred silvia .
hath she forsworn me ?
no , valentine .
no valentine , if silvia have forsworn me .
what is your news ?
sir , there is a proclamation that you are vanished .
that thou art banished o , that the news ! from hence , from silvia and from me thy friend .
o , i have fed upon this woe already , and now excess of it will make me surfeit .
doth silvia know that i am banished ?
ay , ay , and she hath offer to the doom which , unreversed , stands in effectual force a sea of melting pearl , which some call tears those at her father churlish feet she tender , with them , upon her knees , her humble self , wringing her hands , whose whiteness so became them as if but now they waxed pale for woe but neither bended knees , pure hands held up , sad sighs , deep groans , nor tears , could penetrate her uncompassionate sire , but valentine , if he be , must die .
besides , her intercession chafed him so , when she for thy repeal was suppliant , that to close prison he commanded her , with many bitter threats of biding there .
no more , unless the next word that thou have some malignant power upon my life if so , i pray thee , breathe it in mine ear , as ending anthem of my endless dolour .
cease to lament for that thou canst not help , and study help for that which thou .
time is the nurse and breeder of all good .
here if thou stay , thou canst not see thy love , besides , thy staying will abridge thy life .
hope is a lover staff , walk hence with that and manage it against despairing thoughts .
thy letters may be here , though thou art hence , which , being writ to me , shall be deliver even in the bosom of thy love .
the time now serves not to expostulate come , i convey thee through the , and , ere i part with thee , confer at large of all that may concern thy .
as thou lovest silvia , though not for thyself , regard thy danger , and along with me !
i pray thee , launce , an if thou seest my boy , bid him make haste and meet me at the .
go , sirrah , find him out .
come , valentine .
o my dear silvia !
hapless valentine !
exeunt valentine and proteus i am but a fool , look you , and yet i have the wit to think my master is a kind of a knave but that all one , if he be but one knave .
he lives not now that knows me to be in love , yet i am in love , but a team of horse shall not pluck that from me , nor who is i love , and yet is a woman , but what woman , i will not tell myself , and yet is a milkmaid , yet is not a maid , for she hath had gossips , yet is a maid , for she is her master maid , and serves for wages .
she hath more qualities than a , which is much in a bare christian .
pulling out a paper here is the of her condition .
she can fetch and carry . '
why , a horse can do no more nay , a horse can not fetch , but only carry , therefore is she better than a jade .
she can milk , ' look you , a sweet virtue in a maid with clean hands .
enter speed how now , signior launce !
what news with your mastership ?
with my master ship ?
why , it is at sea .
well , your old vice still , mistake the word .
what news , then , in your paper ?
the blackest news that ever thou heardest .
why , man , how black ?
why , as black as ink .
let me read them .
fie on thee , !
thou canst not read .
thou liest , i can .
i will try thee .
tell me this who begot thee ?
marry , the son of my grandfather .
o illiterate loiterer !
it was the son of thy grandmother this proves that thou canst not read .
come , fool , come , try me in thy paper .
there , and nicholas be thy speed !
reads she can milk . '
ay , that she can .
she brews good ale . '
and thereof comes the proverb of your heart , you brew good ale . '
she can sew . '
that as much as to say , can she so ?
she can knit . '
what need a man care for a stock with a wench , when she can knit him a stock ?
she can wash and scour . '
a special virtue for then she need not be washed and scoured .
she can spin . '
then may i set the world on wheels , when she can spin for her living .
she hath many nameless virtues . '
that as much as to say , bastard virtues , that , indeed , know not their fathers and therefore have no names .
follow her vices . '
close at the heels of her virtues .
she is not to be kissed fasting in respect of her breath . '
well , that fault may be mended with a breakfast .
read on .
she hath a sweet mouth . '
that makes amends for her sour breath .
she doth talk in her sleep . '
it no matter for that , so she sleep not in her talk .
she is slow in words . '
o villain , that set this down among her vices !
to be slow in words is a woman only virtue i pray thee , out , and place it for her chief virtue .
she is proud . '
out with that too , it was eve legacy , and can not be from her .
she hath no teeth . '
i care not for that neither , because i love crusts .
she is curst . '
well , the best is , she hath no teeth to bite .
she will often praise her liquor . '
if her liquor be good , she shall if she will not , i will , for good things should be praised .
she is too liberal . '
of her tongue she can not , for that writ down she is slow of , of her purse she shall not , for that i keep shut now , of another thing she may , and that can not i help .
well , proceed .
she hath more hair than wit , and more faults than hairs , and more wealth than faults . '
stop there , i have her she was mine , and not mine , twice or thrice in that last article .
rehearse that once more .
she hath more hair than wit , ' more hair than wit ?
it may be , i prove it .
the cover of the salt hides the salt , and therefore it is more than the salt , the hair that covers the wit is more than the wit , for the greater hides the less .
what next ?
more faults than hairs , ' that monstrous o , that that were out !
more wealth than faults . '
why , that word makes the faults gracious .
well , i have her , and if it be a match , as nothing is impossible , what then ?
why , then will i tell thee that thy master stays for thee at the .
for me ?
for thee !
ay , who art thou ?
he hath stayed for a better man than thee .
and must i go to him ?
thou must run to him , for thou hast stayed so long that going will scarce serve the turn .
why didst not tell me sooner ?
pox of your love letters !
exit now will he be swinged for reading my letter , an unmannerly slave , that will thrust himself into secrets !
i after , to rejoice in the boy correction .
exit scene ii .
the same .
the duke palace .
enter duke and thurio sir thurio , fear not but that she will love you , now valentine is banish from her sight .
since his exile she hath despised me most , forsworn my company and rail at me , that i am desperate of obtaining her .
this weak impress of love is as a figure trenched in ice , which with an hour heat dissolves to water and doth lose his form .
a little time will melt her frozen thoughts and worthless valentine shall be forgot .
enter proteus how now , sir proteus !
is your countryman according to our proclamation gone ?
gone , my good lord .
my daughter takes his going grievously .
a little time , my lord , will kill that grief .
so i believe , but thurio thinks not so .
proteus , the good conceit i hold of thee for thou hast shown some sign of good desert makes me the better to confer with thee .
longer than i prove loyal to your grace let me not live to look upon your grace .
thou how willingly i would effect the match between sir thurio and my daughter .
i do , my lord .
and also , i think , thou art not ignorant how she opposes her against my will she did , my lord , when valentine was here .
ay , and perversely she persevers so .
what might we do to make the girl forget the love of valentine and love sir thurio ?
the best way is to slander valentine with falsehood , cowardice and poor descent , three things that women highly hold in hate .
ay , but she think that it is spoke in hate .
ay , if his enemy deliver it therefore it must with circumstance be spoken by one whom she esteemeth as his friend .
then you must undertake to slander him .
and that , my lord , i shall be loath to do is an ill office for a gentleman , especially against his very friend .
where your good word can not advantage him , your slander never can endamage him , therefore the office is indifferent , being entreated to it by your friend .
you have prevail , my lord , if i can do it by ought that i can speak in his dispraise , she shall not long continue love to him .
but say this weed her love from valentine , it follows not that she will love sir thurio .
therefore , as you unwind her love from him , lest it should ravel and be good to none , you must provide to bottom it on me , which must be done by praising me as much as you in worth dispraise sir valentine .
and , proteus , we dare trust you in this kind , because we know , on valentine report , you are already love firm votary and can not soon revolt and change your mind .
upon this warrant shall you have access where you with silvia may confer at large , for she is lumpish , heavy , melancholy , and , for your friend sake , will be glad of you , where you may temper her by your persuasion to hate young valentine and love my friend .
as much as i can do , i will effect but you , sir thurio , are not sharp enough , you must lay lime to tangle her desires by wailful sonnets , whose composed rhymes should be with serviceable vows .
ay , much is the force of poesy .
say that upon the altar of her beauty you sacrifice your tears , your sighs , your heart write till your ink be dry , and with your tears moist it again , and frame some feeling line that may discover such integrity for orpheus ' lute was strung with poets ' sinews , whose golden touch could soften steel and stones , make tigers tame and huge leviathans forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands .
after your elegies , visit by night your lady with some sweet concert , to their instruments tune a deploring dump the night dead silence will well become such grievance .
this , or else nothing , will inherit her .
this discipline shows thou hast been in love .
and thy advice this night i put in practise .
therefore , sweet proteus , my , let us into the city presently to sort some gentlemen well skill in music .
i have a sonnet that will serve the turn to give the onset to thy good advice .
about it , gentlemen !
we wait upon your grace till after supper , and afterward determine our proceedings .
even now about it !
i will pardon you .
exeunt act iv scene i .

enter certain outlaws fellows , stand fast , i see a passenger .
if there be ten , shrink not , but down with .
enter valentine and speed stand , sir , and throw us that you have about ye if not we make you sit and rifle you .
sir , we are undone , these are the villains that all the travellers do fear so much .
my friends , that not so , sir we are your enemies .
peace !
we hear him .
ay , by my beard , will we , for he a proper man .
then know that i have little wealth to lose a man i am cross with adversity , my riches are these poor habiliments , of which if you should here disfurnish me , you take the sum and substance that i have .
whither travel you ?
to verona .
whence came you ?
from milan .
have you long sojourned there ?
some sixteen months , and longer might have stay , if crooked fortune had not thwarted me .
what , were you banish thence ?
i was .
for what offence ?
for that which now torments me to rehearse i kill a man , whose death i much repent , bu t yet i slew him manfully in fight , without false vantage or base treachery .
why , repent it , if it were done so .
but were you banish for so small a fault ?
i was , and held me glad of such a doom .
have you the tongues ?
my youthful travel therein made me happy , or else i often had been miserable .
by the bare scalp of robin hood fat friar , this fellow were a king for our wild faction !
we have him .
sirs , a word .
master , be one of them , it an honourable kind of thievery .
peace , villain !
tell us this have you any thing to take to ?
nothing but my fortune .
know , then , that some of us are gentlemen , such as the fury of ungovern youth thrust from the company of awful men myself was from verona banished for practising to steal away a lady , an heir , and near allied unto the duke .
and i from mantua , for a gentleman , who , in my mood , i stabb unto the heart .
and i for such like petty crimes as these , but to the purpose for we cite our faults , that they may hold excus our lawless lives , and partly , seeing you are beautified with goodly shape and by your own report a linguist and a man of such perfection as we do in our quality much want indeed , because you are a banish man , therefore , above the rest , we parley to you are you content to be our general ?
to make a virtue of necessity and live , as we do , in this wilderness ?
what thou ?
wilt thou be of our consort ?
say ay , and be the captain of us all we do thee homage and be ruled by thee , love thee as our commander and our king .
but if thou scorn our courtesy , thou diest .
thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer .
i take your offer and will live with you , provided that you do no outrages on silly women or poor passengers .
no , we detest such vile base practises .
come , go with us , we bring thee to our crews , and show thee all the treasure we have got , which , with ourselves , all rest at thy dispose .
exeunt scene ii .
milan .
outside the duke palace , under silvia chamber .
enter proteus already have i been false to valentine and now i must be as unjust to thurio .
under the colour of commending him , i have access my own love to prefer but silvia is too fair , too true , too holy , to be corrupted with my worthless gifts .
when i protest true loyalty to her , she twits me with my falsehood to my friend , when to her beauty i commend my vows , she bids me think how i have been forsworn in breaking faith with julia whom i loved and notwithstanding all her sudden quips , the least whereof would quell a lover hope , yet , , the more she spurns my love , the more it grows and fawneth on her still .
but here comes thurio now must we to her window , and give some evening music to her ear .
enter thurio and musicians how now , sir proteus , are you crept before us ?
ay , gentle thurio for you know that love will creep in service where it can not go .
ay , but i hope , sir , that you love not here .
sir , but i do , or else i would be hence .
who ?
silvia ?
ay , silvia , for your sake .
i thank you for your own .
now , gentlemen , let tune , and to it lustily awhile .
enter , at a distance , host , and julia in boy clothes now , my young guest , methinks you allycholly i pray you , why is it ?
marry , mine host , because i can not be merry .
come , we have you merry i bring you where you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for .
but shall i hear him speak ?
ay , that you shall .
that will be music .
music plays hark , hark !
is he among these ?
ay but , peace !
let hear .
song .
who is silvia ?
what is she , that all our swains commend her ?
holy , fair and wise is she , the heaven such grace did lend her , that she might admired be .
is she kind as she is fair ?
for beauty lives with kindness .
love doth to her eyes repair , to help him of his blindness , and , being help , inhabits there .
then to silvia let us sing , that silvia is excelling , she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling to her let us garlands bring .
how now !
are you sadder than you were before ?
how do you , man ?
the music likes you not .
you mistake , the musician likes me not .
why , my pretty youth ?
he plays false , father .
how ?
out of tune on the strings ?
not so , but yet so false that he grieves my very .
you have a quick ear .
ay , i would i were deaf , it makes me have a slow heart .
i perceive you delight not in music .
not a whit , when it jars so .
hark , what fine change is in the music !
ay , that change is the spite .
you would have them always play but one thing ?
i would always have one play but one thing .
but , host , doth this sir proteus that we talk on often resort unto this gentlewoman ?
i tell you what launce , his man , told me he loved her out of all nick .
where is launce ?
gone to seek his dog , which tomorrow , by his master command , he must carry for a present to his lady .
peace !
stand aside the company parts .
sir thurio , fear not you i will so plead that you shall say my cunning drift excels .
where meet we ?
at saint gregory well .
farewell .
exeunt thurio and musicians enter silvia above madam , good even to your ladyship .
i thank you for your music , gentlemen .
who is that that spake ?
one , lady , if you knew his pure heart truth , you would quickly learn to know him by his voice .
sir proteus , as i take it .
sir proteus , gentle lady , and your servant .
what your will ?
that i may compass yours .
you have your wish , my will is even this that presently you hie you home to bed .
thou subtle , perjured , false , disloyal man !
thou i am so shallow , so conceitless , to be seduced by thy flattery , that hast deceived so many with thy vows ?
return , return , and make thy love amends .
for me , by this pale queen of night i swear , i am so far from granting thy request that i despise thee for thy wrongful suit , and by and by intend to chide myself even for this time i spend in talking to thee .
i grant , sweet love , that i did love a lady , but she is dead .
aside false , if i should speak it , for i am sure she is not buried .
say that she be , yet valentine thy friend survives , to whom , thyself art witness , i am betroth and art thou not ashamed to wrong him with thy importunacy ?
i likewise hear that valentine is dead .
and so suppose am i , for in his grave assure thyself my love is buried .
sweet lady , let me rake it from the earth .
go to thy lady grave and call hers thence , or , at the least , in hers sepulchre thine .
aside he heard not that .
madam , if your heart be so obdurate , vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love , the picture that is hanging in your chamber , to that i speak , to that i sigh and weep for since the substance of your perfect self is else devoted , i am but a shadow , and to your shadow will i make true love .
aside if a substance , you would , sure , deceive it , and make it but a shadow , as i am .
i am very loath to be your idol , sir , but since your falsehood shall become you well to worship shadows and adore false shapes , send to me in the morning and i send it and so , good rest .
as wretches have that wait for execution in the morn .
exeunt proteus and silvia severally host , will you go ?
by my halidom , i was fast asleep .
pray you , where lies sir proteus ?
marry , at my house .
trust me , i think is almost day .
not so , but it hath been the longest night that i watch and the most heaviest .
exeunt scene iii .

enter eglamour this is the hour that madam silvia entreated me to call and know her mind there some great matter employ me in .
madam , madam !

your servant and your friend , one that attends your ladyship command .
sir eglamour , a thousand times good morrow .
as many , worthy lady , to yourself according to your ladyship impose , i am thus early come to know what service it is your pleasure to command me in .

thyself hast loved , and i have heard thee say no grief did ever come so near thy heart as when thy lady and thy true love died , upon whose grave thou pure chastity .
sir eglamour , i would to valentine , to mantua , where i hear he makes abode , and , for the ways are dangerous to pass , i do desire thy worthy company , upon whose faith and honour i repose .

exeunt severally scene iv .
the same .
enter launce , with his his dog when a man servant shall play the cur with him , look you , it goes hard one that i brought up of a puppy , one that i saved from drowning , when three or four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it .
i have taught him , even as one would say precisely , i would teach a dog . '
i was sent to deliver him as a present to mistress silvia from my master , and i came no sooner into the but he steps me to her trencher and steals her capon leg o , is a foul thing when a cur can not keep himself in all companies !
i would have , as one should say , one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed , to be , as it were , a dog at all things .
if i had not had more wit than he , to take a fault upon me that he did , i think verily he had been hanged , sure as i live , he had suffered , you shall judge .
he thrusts me himself into the company of three or four gentlemanlike dogs under the duke table he had not been there bless the mark ! a pissing while , but all the chamber smelt him .
with the dog ! '
says one cur is that ? '
says another him out ' says the third him up ' says the duke .
i , having been acquainted with the smell before , knew it was crab , and goes me to the fellow that whips the dogs , ' quoth i , mean to whip the dog ? '
, marry , do i , ' quoth he .
do him the more wrong , ' quoth i , twas i did the thing you wot of . '
he makes me no more ado , but whips me out of the chamber .
how many masters would do this for his servant ?
nay , i be sworn , i have sat in the stocks for puddings he hath stolen , otherwise he had been executed , i have stood on the pillory for geese he hath killed , otherwise he had suffered .
thou thinkest not of this now .
nay , i remember the trick you served me when i took my leave of madam silvia did not i bid thee still mark me and do as i do ?
when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make water against a gentlewoman farthingale ?
didst thou ever see me do such a trick ?
enter proteus and julia sebastian is thy name ?
i like thee well and will employ thee in some service presently .
in what you please i do what i can .
i hope thou wilt .
to launce how now , you whoreson peasant !
where have you been these two days loitering ?
marry , sir , i carried mistress silvia the dog you bade me .
and what says she to my little jewel ?
marry , she says your dog was a cur , and tells you currish thanks is good enough for such a present .
but she received my dog ?
no , indeed , did she not here have i brought him back again .
what , didst thou offer her this from me ?
ay , sir the other squirrel was stolen from me by the hangman boys in the and then i offered her mine own , who is a dog as big as ten of yours , and therefore the gift the greater .
go get thee hence , and find my dog again , or return again into my sight .
away , i say !
thou to vex me here ?
exit launce a slave , that still an end turns me to shame !
sebastian , i have entertained thee , partly that i have need of such a youth that can with some discretion do my business , for is no trusting to yond foolish lout , but chiefly for thy face and thy behavior , which , if my augury deceive me not , witness good bringing up , fortune and truth therefore know thou , for this i entertain thee .
go presently and take this ring with thee , deliver it to madam silvia she loved me well deliver it to me .
it seems you loved not her , to leave her token .
she is dead , belike ?
not so , i think she lives .
alas !
why dost thou cry ' ?
i can not choose but pity her .
wherefore shouldst thou pity her ?
because methinks that she loved you as well as you do love your lady silvia she dreams of him that has forgot her love , you dote on her that cares not for your love .
is pity love should be so contrary , and thinking of it makes me cry ! '
well , give her that ring and therewithal this letter .
that her chamber .
tell my lady i claim the promise for her heavenly picture .
your message done , hie home unto my chamber , where thou shalt find me , sad and solitary .
exit how many women would do such a message ?
alas , poor proteus !
thou hast entertain a fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs .
alas , poor fool !
why do i pity him that with his very heart despiseth me ?
because he loves her , he despiseth me , because i love him i must pity him .
this ring i gave him when he parted from me , to bind him to remember my good will , and now am i , unhappy messenger , to plead for that which i would not obtain , to carry that which i would have refused , to praise his faith which i would have dispraised .
i am my master love , but can not be true servant to my master , unless i prove false traitor to myself .
yet will i woo for him , but yet so coldly as , heaven it knows , i would not have him speed .
enter silvia , attended gentlewoman , good day !
i pray you , be my mean to bring me where to speak with madam silvia .
what would you with her , if that i be she ?
if you be she , i do entreat your patience to hear me speak the message i am sent on .
from whom ?
from my master , sir proteus , madam .
o , he sends you for a picture .
ay , madam .
ursula , bring my picture here .
go give your master this tell him from me , one julia , that his changing thoughts forget , would better fit his chamber than this shadow .
madam , please you peruse this pardon me , madam , i have unadvised deliver you a paper that i should not this is the letter to your ladyship .
i pray thee , let me look on that again .
it may not be , good madam , pardon me .
there , hold !
i will not look upon your master lines i know they are stuff with protestations and full of oaths , which he will break as easily as i do tear his paper .
madam , he sends your ladyship this ring .
the more shame for him that he sends it me , for i have heard him say a thousand times his julia gave it him at his departure .
though his false finger have profaned the ring , mine shall not do his julia so much wrong .
she thanks you .
what thou ?
i thank you , madam , that you tender her .
poor gentlewoman !
my master wrongs her much .
dost thou know her ?
almost as well as i do know myself to think upon her woes i do protest that i have wept a hundred several times .
belike she thinks that proteus hath forsook her .
i think she doth , and that her cause of sorrow .
is she not passing fair ?
she hath been fairer , madam , than she is when she did think my master loved her well , she , in my judgment , was as fair as you but since she did neglect her and threw her mask away , the air hath starved the roses in her cheeks and pinch the of her face , that now she is become as black as i .
how tall was she ?
about my stature , for at pentecost , when all our pageants of delight were play , our youth got me to play the woman part , and i was trimm in madam julia gown , which served me as fit , by all men judgments , as if the garment had been made for me therefore i know she is about my height .
and at that time i made her weep agood , for i did play a lamentable part madam , was ariadne passioning for theseus ' perjury and unjust flight , which i so lively acted with my tears that my poor mistress , moved therewithal , wept bitterly , and would i might be dead if i in thought felt not her very sorrow !
she is beholding to thee , gentle youth .
alas , poor lady , desolate and left !
i weep myself to think upon thy words .
here , youth , there is my purse , i give thee this for thy sweet mistress ' sake , because thou lovest her .
farewell .
exit silvia , with attendants and she shall thank you , if you know her .
a virtuous gentlewoman , mild and beautiful i hope my master suit will be but cold , since she respects my mistress ' love so much .
alas , how love can trifle with itself !
here is her picture let me see , i think , if i had such a tire , this face of mine were full as lovely as is this of hers and yet the painter flatter her a little , unless i flatter with myself too much .
her hair is auburn , mine is perfect yellow if that be all the difference in his love , i get me such a colour periwig .
her eyes are grey as glass , and so are mine ay , but her forehead low , and mine as high .
what should it be that he respects in her but i can make respective in myself , if this fond love were not a blinded god ?
come , shadow , come and take this shadow up , for is thy rival .
o thou senseless form , thou shalt be worshipp , kiss , loved and adored !
and , were there sense in his idolatry , my substance should be statue in thy stead .
i use thee kindly for thy mistress ' sake , that used me so , or else , by jove i vow , i should have scratch out your unseeing eyes to make my master out of love with thee !

o , sir , i find her milder than she was , and yet she takes exceptions at your person .
what , that my leg is too long ?
no , that it is too little .
i wear a boot , to make it somewhat rounder .
aside but love will not be spurr to what it loathes .
what says she to my face ?
she says it is a fair one .
nay then , the wanton lies , my face is black .
but pearls are fair , and the old saying is , black men are pearls in beauteous ladies ' eyes .
aside is true , such pearls as put out ladies ' eyes , for i had rather wink than look on them .
how likes she my discourse ?
ill , when you talk of war .
but well , when i discourse of love and peace ?
aside but better , indeed , when you hold your peace .
what says she to my valour ?
o , sir , she makes no doubt of that .
aside she needs not , when she knows it cowardice .
what says she to my birth ?
that you are well derived .
aside true , from a gentleman to a fool .
considers she my possessions ?

wherefore ?

how now , thurio !
which of you saw sir eglamour of late ?
not i .
nor i .
saw you my daughter ?
neither .
why then , she fled unto that peasant valentine , and eglamour is in her company .
is true , for friar laurence met them both , as he in penance wander through the forest , him he knew well , and guess that it was she , but , being mask , he was not sure of it , besides , she did intend confession at patrick cell this even , and there she was not , these likelihoods confirm her flight from hence .
therefore , i pray you , stand not to discourse , but mount you presently and meet with me upon the rising of the that leads towards mantua , whither they are fled dispatch , sweet gentlemen , and follow me .
exit why , this it is to be a peevish girl , that flies her fortune when it follows her .
i after , more to be revenged on eglamour than for the love of reckless silvia .
exit and i will follow , more for silvia love than hate of eglamour that goes with her .

exeunt scene iv .

enter valentine how use doth breed a habit in a man !
this shadowy desert , unfrequented woods , i better brook than flourishing peopled towns here can i sit alone , unseen of any , and to the nightingale complaining notes tune my distresses and record my woes .
o thou that dost inhabit in my breast , leave not the mansion so long tenantless , lest , growing ruinous , the building fall and leave no memory of what it was !
repair me with thy presence , silvia , thou gentle nymph , cherish thy forlorn swain !
what halloing and what stir is this ?
these are my mates , that make their wills their law , have some unhappy passenger in chase .
they love me well , yet i have much to do to keep them from uncivil outrages .
withdraw thee , valentine who this comes here ?
enter proteus , silvia , and julia madam , this service i have done for you , though you respect not aught your servant doth , to hazard life and rescue you from him that would have forced your honour and your love , vouchsafe me , for my meed , but one fair look , a smaller boon than this i can not beg and less than this , i am sure , you can not give .
aside how like a dream is this i see and hear !
love , lend me patience to forbear awhile .
o miserable , unhappy that i am !
unhappy were you , madam , ere i came , but by my coming i have made you happy .
by thy approach thou makest me most unhappy .
aside and me , when he approacheth to your presence .
had i been seized by a hungry lion , i would have been a breakfast to the beast , rather than have false proteus rescue me .
o , heaven be judge how i love valentine , whose life as tender to me as my soul !
and full as much , for more there can not be , i do detest false perjured proteus .
therefore be gone , solicit me no more .
what dangerous action , stood it next to death , would i not undergo for one calm look !
o , is the curse in love , and still approved , when women can not love where they beloved !
when proteus can not love where he beloved .
read over julia heart , thy first best love , for whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith into a thousand oaths , and all those oaths descended into perjury , to love me .
thou hast no faith left now , unless two , and that far worse than none , better have none than plural faith which is too much by one thou counterfeit to thy true friend !
in love who respects friend ?
all men but proteus .
nay , if the gentle spirit of moving words can no way change you to a milder form , i woo you like a soldier , at arms ' end , and love you the nature of love , force ye .
o heaven !
i force thee yield to my desire .
ruffian , let go that rude uncivil touch , thou friend of an ill fashion !
valentine !
thou common friend , that without faith or love , for such is a friend now , treacherous man !
thou hast beguiled my hopes , nought but mine eye could have persuaded me now i dare not say i have one friend alive , thou wouldst disprove me .
who should be trusted , when one own right hand is perjured to the bosom ?
proteus , i am sorry i must never trust thee more , but count the world a stranger for thy sake .
the private wound is deepest o time most accurst , all foes that a friend should be the worst !
my shame and guilt confounds me .
forgive me , valentine if hearty sorrow be a sufficient ransom for offence , i tender here , i do as truly suffer as i did commit .
then i am paid , and once again i do receive thee honest .
who by repentance is not satisfied is nor of heaven nor earth , for these are pleased .
by penitence the eternal wrath appeased and , that my love may appear plain and free , all that was mine in silvia i give thee .
o me unhappy !
swoons look to the boy .
why , boy !
why , wag !
how now !
what the matter ?
look up , speak .
o good sir , my master charged me to deliver a ring to madam silvia , which , out of my neglect , was never done .
where is that ring , boy ?
here is , this is it .
how !
let me see why , this is the ring i gave to julia .
o , cry you mercy , sir , i have mistook this is the ring you sent to silvia .
but how camest thou by this ring ?
at my depart i gave this unto julia .
and julia herself did give it me , and julia herself hath brought it hither .
how !
julia !
behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths , and entertain deeply in her heart .
how oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root !
o proteus , let this habit make thee blush !
be thou ashamed that i have took upon me such an immodest raiment , if shame live in a disguise of love it is the lesser blot , modesty finds , women to change their shapes than men their minds .
than men their minds !
is true .
o heaven !
were man but constant , he were perfect .
that one error fills him with faults , makes him run through all the sins inconstancy falls off ere it begins .
what is in silvia face , but i may spy more fresh in julia with a constant eye ?
come , come , a hand from either let me be blest to make this happy close , pity two such friends should be long foes .
bear witness , heaven , i have my wish for ever .

sir valentine !
yonder is silvia , and silvia mine .
thurio , give back , or else embrace thy death , come not within the measure of my wrath , do not name silvia thine , if once again , verona shall not hold thee .
here she stands , take but possession of her with a touch i dare thee but to breathe upon my love .
sir valentine , i care not for her , i , i hold him but a fool that will endanger his body for a girl that loves him not i claim her not , and therefore she is thine .
the more degenerate and base art thou , to make such means for her as thou hast done and leave her on such slight conditions .
now , by the honour of my ancestry , i do applaud thy spirit , valentine , and think thee worthy of an empress ' love know then , i here forget all former griefs , cancel all grudge , repeal thee home again , plead a new state in thy unrivall merit , to which i thus subscribe sir valentine , thou art a gentleman and well derived , take thou thy silvia , for thou hast deserved her .
i thank your grace , the gift hath made me happy .
i now beseech you , for your daughter sake , to grant one boom that i shall ask of you .
i grant it , for thine own , it be .
these banish men that i have kept withal are men endued with worthy qualities forgive them what they have committed here and let them be recall from their exile they are reformed , civil , full of good and fit for great employment , worthy lord .
thou hast prevail , i pardon them and thee dispose of them as thou their deserts .
come , let us go we will include all jars with triumphs , mirth and rare solemnity .
and , as we walk along , i dare be bold with our discourse to make your grace to smile .
what think you of this page , my lord ?
i think the boy hath grace in him , he blushes .
i warrant you , my lord , more grace than boy .
what mean you by that saying ?
please you , i tell you as we pass along , that you will wonder what hath fortuned .

i think , this coming summer , the king of sicilia means to pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him .
wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be justified in our loves , for indeed beseech you , verily , i speak it in the freedom of my knowledge we can not with such magnificence in so rare i know not what to say .
we will give you sleepy drinks , that your senses , unintelligent of our insufficience , may , though they can not praise us , as little accuse us .
you pay a great deal too dear for what given freely .
believe me , i speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance .
sicilia can not show himself to bohemia .
they were trained together in their childhoods , and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection , which can not choose but branch now .
since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society , their encounters , though not personal , have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts , letters , loving embassies , that they have seemed to be together , though absent , shook hands , as over a vast , and embraced , as it were , from the ends of opposed winds .
the heavens continue their loves !
i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it .
you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince mamillius it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note .
i very well agree with you in the hopes of him it is a gallant child , one that indeed physics the subject , makes old hearts fresh they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man .
would they else be content to die ?
yes , if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live .
if the king had no son , they would desire to live on crutches till he had one .

stay your thanks a while , and pay them when you part .
sir , that .
i am question by my fears , of what may chance or breed upon our absence , that may blow no sneaping winds at home , to make us say is put forth too truly ' besides , i have stay to tire your royalty .

very sooth , .
we part the time between then , and in that i no gainsaying .
press me not , beseech you , so .
there is no tongue that moves , none , none i ' the world , so soon as yours could win me so it should now , were there necessity in your request , although needful i denied it .

i had thought , sir , to have held my peace until you have drawn oaths from him not to stay .
you , sir , charge him too coldly .
tell him , you are sure all in bohemia well , this satisfaction the day proclaim say this to him , he beat from his best ward .
well said , hermione .

no , madam .
nay , but you will ?
i may not , verily .
verily !
you put me off with limber vows , but i , though you would seek to unsphere the stars with oaths , should yet say , no going . '
verily , you shall not go a lady ' as potent as a lord .
will you go yet ?
force me to keep you as a prisoner , not like a guest , so you shall pay your fees when you depart , and save your thanks .
how say you ?
my prisoner ?
or my guest ?
by your dread , ' one of them you shall be .
your guest , then , madam to be your prisoner should import offending , which is for me less easy to commit than you to punish .
not your gaoler , then , but your kind hostess .
come , i question you of my lord tricks and yours when you were boys you were pretty lordings then ?
we were , fair queen , two lads that thought there was no more behind but such a day as , and to be boy eternal .
was not my lord the verier wag o ' the two ?
we were as twinn lambs that did frisk i ' the sun , and bleat the one at the other what we changed was innocence for innocence , we knew not the doctrine of , nor dream that any did .
had we pursued that life , and our weak spirits been higher rear with stronger blood , we should have answer heaven boldly guilty , ' the imposition clear hereditary ours .
by this we gather you have tripp since .
o my most sacred lady !
temptations have since then been born to , for in those unfledged days was my wife a girl , your precious self had then not cross the eyes of my young .
grace to boot !
of this make no conclusion , lest you say your queen and i are devils yet go on , the offences we have made you do we answer , if you first sinn with us and that with us you did continue fault and that you slipp not with any but with us .

have i twice said well ?
when before ?
i prithee tell me , cram with praise , and make as fat as tame things one good deed dying tongueless slaughters a thousand waiting upon that .
our praises are our wages you may ride with one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere with spur we beat an acre .
but to the goal my last good deed was to entreat his stay what was my first ?
it has an elder sister , or i mistake you o , would her name were grace !
but once before i spoke to the purpose when ?
nay , let me , i long .
why , that was when three crabbed months had sour themselves to death , ere i could make thee open thy white hand and clap thyself my love then didst thou utter ' i am yours for ever . '
is grace indeed .
why , lo you now , i have spoke to the purpose twice the one for ever earn a royal husband , the other for some while a friend .

there have been , or i am much deceived , cuckolds ere now , and many a man there is , even at this present , now while i speak this , holds his wife by the arm , that little thinks she has been sluiced in absence and his pond fish by his next neighbour , by sir smile , his neighbour nay , there comfort i whiles other men have gates and those gates open , as mine , against their will .
should all despair that have revolted wives , the tenth of mankind would hang themselves .
physic there is none , it is a bawdy planet , that will strike where is predominant , and is powerful , think it , from east , west , north and south be it concluded , no barricado for a belly , , it will let in and out the enemy with bag and baggage many thousand on have the disease , and not .
how now , boy !
i am like you , they say .
why that some comfort .
what , camillo there ?
ay , my good lord .
go play , mamillius , an honest man .
exit mamillius camillo , this great sir will yet stay longer .
you had much ado to make his anchor hold when you cast out , it still came home .
didst note it ?
he would not stay at your petitions made his business more material .
didst perceive it ?
aside they here with me already , whispering , rounding is a ' is far gone , when i shall gust it last .
how , camillo , that he did stay ?
at the good queen entreaty .
at the queen ' should be pertinent but , so it is , it is not .
was this taken by any understanding pate but thine ?
for thy conceit is soaking , will draw in more than the common blocks not noted , , but of the finer natures ?
by some severals of extraordinary ?
lower messes perchance are to this business purblind ?
say .
business , my lord !
i think most understand bohemia stays here longer .
ha !
stays here longer .
ay , but why ?
to satisfy your highness and the entreaties of our most gracious mistress .
satisfy !
the entreaties of your mistress !
satisfy !
let that suffice .
i have trusted thee , camillo , with all the nearest things to my heart , as well my , wherein , , thou hast cleansed my bosom , i from thee departed thy penitent reform but we have been deceived in thy integrity , deceived in that which seems so .
be it forbid , my lord !
to bide upo , thou art not honest , or , if thou inclinest that way , thou art a coward , which hoxes honesty behind , restraining from course required , or else thou must be counted a servant grafted in my serious trust and therein negligent , or else a fool that seest a game play home , the rich stake drawn , and takest it all for jest .
my gracious lord , i may be negligent , foolish and fearful , in every one of these no man is free , but that his negligence , his folly , fear , among the infinite doings of the world , sometime puts forth .
in your affairs , my lord , if ever i were , it was my folly , if industriously i play the fool , it was my negligence , not weighing well the end , if ever fearful to do a thing , where i the issue doubted , where of the execution did cry out against the , was a fear which oft infects the wisest these , my lord , are such allow infirmities that honesty is never free of .
but , beseech your grace , be plainer with me , let me know my trespass by its own visage if i then deny it , is none of mine .
ha ' not you seen , camillo , but that past doubt , you have , or your is thicker than a cuckold horn , or heard , for to a vision so apparent rumour can not be mute , or thought , for cogitation resides not in that man that does not think , my wife is slippery ?
if thou wilt confess , or else be impudently negative , to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought , then say my wife a , deserves a name as rank as any that puts to before her and .
i would not be a to hear my sovereign mistress clouded so , without my present vengeance taken my heart , you never spoke what did become you less than this , which to reiterate were sin as deep as that , though true .
is whispering nothing ?
is leaning cheek to cheek ?
is meeting noses ?
kissing with inside lip ?
stopping the career of laughing with a sigh ? a note infallible of breaking honesty horsing foot on foot ?
skulking in corners ?
wishing clocks more swift ?
hours , minutes ?
noon , midnight ?
and all eyes blind with the pin and web but theirs , theirs only , that would unseen be wicked ?
is this nothing ?
why , then the world and all that i is nothing , the covering sky is nothing , bohemia nothing , my wife is nothing , nor nothing have these nothings , if this be nothing .
good my lord , be cured of this diseased opinion , and betimes , for is most dangerous .
say it be , is true .
no , no , my lord .
it is , you lie , you lie i say thou liest , camillo , and i hate thee , pronounce thee a gross lout , a mindless slave , or else a hovering temporizer , that canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil , inclining to them both were my wife liver infected as her life , she would not live the running of one glass .
who does infect her ?
why , he that wears her like a medal , hanging about his neck , bohemia who , if i had servants true about me , that bare eyes to see alike mine honour as their profits , their own particular thrifts , they would do that which should undo more doing ay , and thou , his cupbearer , whom i from meaner form have benched and reared to worship , who mayst see plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven , how i am galled , mightst bespice a cup , to give mine enemy a lasting wink , which draught to me were cordial .
sir , my lord , i could do this , and that with no rash potion , but with a lingering dram that should not work maliciously like poison but i can not believe this crack to be in my dread mistress , so sovereignly being honourable .
i have loved thee , make that thy question , and go rot !
dost think i am so muddy , so unsettled , to appoint myself in this vexation , sully the purity and whiteness of my sheets , which to preserve is sleep , which being spotted is goads , thorns , nettles , tails of wasps , give scandal to the blood o ' the prince my son , who i do think is mine and love as mine , without ripe moving ?
would i do this ?
could man so blench ?
i must believe you , sir i do , and will fetch off bohemia , provided that , when he removed , your highness will take again your queen as yours at first , even for your son sake , and thereby for sealing the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms known and allied to yours .
thou dost advise me even so as i mine own course have set down i give no blemish to her honour , none .
my lord , go then , and with a countenance as clear as friendship wears at feasts , keep with bohemia and with your queen .
i am his cupbearer if from me he have wholesome beverage , account me not your servant .
this is all and thou hast the one half of my heart , not , thou thine own .
i , my lord .
i will seem friendly , as thou hast advised me .
exit o miserable lady !
but , for me , what case stand i in ?
i must be the poisoner of good polixenes , and my ground to is the obedience to a master , one who in rebellion with himself will have all that are his so too .
to do this deed , promotion follows .
if i could find example of thousands that had struck anointed kings and flourish after , not , but since nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one , let villany itself .
i must forsake the court to , or no , is certain to me a .
happy star , reign now !
here comes bohemia .
polixenes this is strange methinks my favour here begins to warp .
not speak ?
good day , camillo .
hail , most royal sir !
what is the news i ' the court ?
none rare , my lord .
the king hath on him such a countenance as he had lost some province and a region loved as he loves himself even now i met him with customary compliment , when he , wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling a lip of much contempt , speeds from me and so leaves me to consider what is breeding that changeth thus his manners .
i dare not know , my lord .
how !
dare not !
do not .
do you know , and dare not ?
be intelligent to me is thereabouts , for , to yourself , what you do know , you must .
and can not say , you dare not .
good camillo , your changed complexions are to me a mirror which shows me mine changed too , for i must be a party in this alteration , finding myself thus alter with .
there is a sickness which puts some of us in distemper , but i can not name the disease , and it is caught of you that yet are well .
how !
caught of me !
make me not sighted like the basilisk i have look on thousands , who have sped the better by my regard , but kill none so .
camillo , as you are certainly a gentleman , thereto experienced , which no less adorns our gentry than our parents ' noble names , in whose success we are gentle , i beseech you , if you know aught which does behove my knowledge thereof to be inform , impriso not in ignorant concealment .
i may not answer .
a sickness caught of me , and yet i well !
i must be answer .
dost thou hear , camillo , i conjure thee , by all the parts of man which honour does acknowledge , whereof the least is not this suit of mine , that thou declare what incidency thou dost guess of harm is creeping toward me , how far off , how near , which way to be prevented , if to be , if not , how best to bear it .
sir , i will tell you , since i am charged in honour and by him that i think honourable therefore mark my counsel , which must be even as swiftly follow as i mean to utter it , or both yourself and me cry lost , and so good night !
on , good camillo .
i am appointed him to murder you .
by whom , camillo ?
by the king .
for what ?
he thinks , nay , with all confidence he swears , as he had see or been an instrument to vice you , that you have touch his queen forbiddenly .
o , then my best blood turn to an infected jelly and my name be yoked with his that did betray the best !
turn then my freshest reputation to a savour that may strike the dullest nostril where i arrive , and my approach be shunn , nay , hated too , worse than the infection that was heard or read !
swear his thought over by each particular star in heaven and by all their influences , you may as well forbid the sea for to obey the moon as or by oath remove or counsel shake the fabric of his folly , whose foundation is piled upon his faith and will continue the standing of his body .
how should this grow ?
i know not but i am sure is safer to avoid what grown than question how is born .
if therefore you dare trust my honesty , that lies enclosed in this trunk which you shall bear along impawn , away !
your followers i will whisper to the business , and will by twos and threes at several posterns clear them o ' the city .
for myself , i put my fortunes to your service , which are here by this discovery lost .
be not uncertain , for , by the honour of my parents , i have utter truth which if you seek to prove , i dare not stand by , nor shall you be safer than one condemn by the king own mouth , thereon his execution sworn .
i do believe thee i saw his heart in face .
give me thy hand be pilot to me and thy places shall still neighbour mine .
my ships are ready and my people did expect my hence departure two days ago .
this jealousy is for a precious creature as she rare , must it be great , and as his person mighty , must it be violent , and as he does conceive he is dishonour by a man which ever profess to him , why , his revenges must in that be made more bitter .
fear me good expedition be my friend , and comfort the gracious queen , part of his theme , but nothing of his suspicion !
come , camillo , i will respect thee as a father if thou my life off hence let us avoid .
it is in mine authority to command the keys of all the posterns please your highness to take the urgent hour .
come , sir , away .
exeunt act ii scene i .
a room in leontes ' palace .
enter hermione , mamillius , and ladies take the boy to you he so troubles me , is past enduring .
come , my gracious lord , shall i be your playfellow ?
no , i none of you .
why , my sweet lord ?
you kiss me hard and speak to me as if i were a baby still .
i love you better .
and why so , my lord ?
not for because your brows are blacker , yet black brows , they say , become some women best , so that there be not too much hair there , but in a semicircle or a made with a pen .
who taught you this ?
i learnt it out of women faces .
pray now what colour are your eyebrows ?
blue , my lord .
nay , that a mock i have seen a lady nose that has been blue , but not her eyebrows .
hark ye , the queen your mother rounds apace we shall present our services to a fine new prince one of these days , and then wanton with us , if we would have you .
she is spread of late into a goodly bulk good time encounter her !
what wisdom stirs amongst you ?
come , sir , now i am for you again pray you , sit by us , and tell a tale .
merry or sad be ?
as merry as you will .
a sad tale best for winter i have one of sprites and goblins .
let have that , good sir .
come on , sit down come on , and do your best to fright me with your sprites , you powerful at it .
there was a man nay , come , sit down , then on .
dwelt by a churchyard i will tell it softly , yond crickets shall not hear it .
come on , then , and me in mine ear .
enter leontes , with antigonus , lords and others was he met there ?
his train ?
camillo with him ?
behind the tuft of pines i met them , never saw i men scour so on their way i eyed them even to their ships .
how blest am i in my just censure , in my true opinion !
alack , for lesser knowledge !
how accursed in being so blest !
there may be in the cup a spider steep , and one may drink , depart , and yet partake no venom , for his knowledge is not infected but if one present the abhorr ingredient to his eye , make known how he hath drunk , he cracks his gorge , his sides , with violent hefts .
i have drunk , and seen the spider .
camillo was his help in this , his pander there is a plot against my life , my crown , all true that is mistrusted that false villain whom i employ was by him he has discover my design , and i remain a pinch thing , yea , a very trick for them to play at will .
how came the posterns so easily open ?
by his great authority , which often hath no less prevail than so on your command .
i too well .
give me the boy i am glad you did not nurse him though he does bear some signs of me , yet you have too much blood in him .
what is this ?
sport ?
bear the boy hence , he shall not come about her , away with him !
and let her sport herself with that she big with , for is polixenes has made thee swell thus .
but say he had not , and i be sworn you would believe my saying , you lean to the nayward .
you , my lords , look on her , mark her well , be but about to say is a goodly lady , ' and the justice of your bearts will thereto add is pity she not honest , honourable ' praise her but for this her form , which on my faith deserves high speech , and straight the shrug , the hum or ha , these petty brands that calumny doth use o , i am out that mercy does , for calumny will sear virtue itself these shrugs , these hums and ha , when you have said goodly , ' come between ere you can say honest ' but be known , from him that has most cause to grieve it should be , she an adulteress .
should a villain say so , the most replenish villain in the world , he were as much more villain you , my lord , do but mistake .
you have mistook , my lady , polixenes for leontes o thou thing !
which i not call a creature of thy place , lest barbarism , making me the precedent , should a like language use to all degrees and mannerly distinguishment leave out betwixt the prince and beggar i have said she an adulteress , i have said with whom more , she a traitor and camillo is a federary with her , and one that knows what she should shame to know herself but with her most vile principal , that she a , even as bad as those that vulgars give titles , ay , and privy to this their late escape .
no , by my life .
privy to none of this .
how will this grieve you , when you shall come to clearer knowledge , that you thus have publish me !
gentle my lord , you scarce can right me throughly then to say you did mistake .
no , if i mistake in those foundations which i build upon , the centre is not big enough to bear a top .
away with her !
to prison !
he who shall speak for her is afar off guilty but that he speaks .
there some ill planet reigns i must be patient till the heavens look with an aspect more favourable .
good my lords , i am not prone to weeping , as our sex commonly are , the want of which vain dew perchance shall dry your pities but i have that honourable grief lodged here which burns worse than tears drown beseech you all , my lords , with thoughts so qualified as your charities shall best instruct you , measure me , and so the king will be perform !
shall i be heard ?
who that goes with me ?
beseech your highness , my women may be with me , for you see my plight requires it .
do not weep , good fools , there is no cause when you shall know your mistress has deserved prison , then abound in tears as i come out this action i now go on is for my better grace .
adieu , my lord i never wish to see you sorry , now i trust i shall .
my women , come , you have leave .
go , do our bidding , hence !
exit hermione , guarded , with ladies beseech your highness , call the queen again .
be certain what you do , sir , lest your justice prove violence , in the which three great ones suffer , yourself , your queen , your son .
for her , my lord , i dare my life lay down and will , sir , please you to accept it , that the queen is spotless i ' the eyes of heaven and to you , i mean , in this which you accuse her .
if it prove she otherwise , i keep my stables where i lodge my wife , i go in couples with her , than when i feel and see her no farther trust her , for every inch of woman in the world , ay , every dram of woman flesh is false , if she be .
hold your peaces .
good my lord , it is for you we speak , not for ourselves you are abused and by some that will be damn , would i knew the villain , i would him .
be she , i have three daughters , the eldest is eleven the second and the third , nine , and some five , if this prove true , they pay by mine honour , i geld all , fourteen they shall not see , to bring false generations they are , and i had rather glib myself than they should not produce fair issue .
cease , no more .
you smell this business with a sense as cold as is a dead man nose but i do and as you feel doing thus , and see withal the instruments that feel .
if it be so , we need no grave to bury honesty there not a grain of it the face to sweeten of the whole dungy earth .
what !
lack i credit ?
i had rather you did lack than i , my lord , upon this ground , and more it would content me to have her honour true than your suspicion , be blamed how you might .
why , what need we commune with you of this , but rather follow our forceful instigation ?
our prerogative calls not your counsels , but our natural goodness imparts this , which if you , or stupefied or seeming so in skill , can not or will not relish a truth like us , inform yourselves we need no more of your advice the matter , the loss , the gain , the ordering o , is all properly ours .
and i wish , my liege , you had only in your silent judgment tried it , without more overture .
how could that be ?
either thou art most ignorant by age , or thou wert born a fool .
camillo flight , added to their familiarity , which was as gross as ever touch conjecture , that lack sight only , nought for approbation but only seeing , all other circumstances made up to the deed , doth push on this proceeding yet , for a greater confirmation , for in an act of this importance most piteous to be wild , i have dispatch in post to sacred delphos , to apollo temple , cleomenes and dion , whom you know of stuff sufficiency now from the oracle they will bring all , whose spiritual counsel had , shall stop or spur me .
have i done well ?
well done , my lord .
though i am satisfied and need no more than what i know , yet shall the oracle give rest to the minds of others , such as he whose ignorant credulity will not come up to the truth .
so have we thought it good from our free person she should be confined , lest that the treachery of the two fled hence be left her to perform .
come , follow us , we are to speak in public , for this business will raise us all .
aside to laughter , as i take it , if the good truth were known .
exeunt scene ii .
a prison .
enter paulina , a gentleman , and attendants the keeper of the prison , call to him , let him have knowledge who i am .
exit gentleman good lady , no court in europe is too good for thee , what dost thou then in prison ?
gentleman , with the gaoler now , good sir , you know me , do you not ?
for a worthy lady and one whom much i honour .
pray you then , conduct me to the queen .
i may not , madam to the contrary i have express commandment .
here ado , to lock up honesty and honour from the access of gentle visitors !
lawful , pray you , to see her women ?
any of them ?
emilia ?
so please you , madam , to put apart these your attendants , i shall bring emilia forth .
i pray now , call her .
withdraw yourselves .
exeunt gentleman and attendants and , madam , i must be present at your conference .
well , so , prithee .
exit gaoler here such ado to make no stain a stain as passes colouring .
gaoler , with emilia dear gentlewoman , how fares our gracious lady ?
as well as one so great and so forlorn may hold together on her frights and griefs , which never tender lady hath born greater , she is something before her time deliver .
a boy ?
a daughter , and a goodly babe , lusty and like to live the queen receives much comfort i , says poor prisoner , i am innocent as you . '
i dare be sworn these dangerous unsafe lunes i ' the king , beshrew them !
he must be told o , and he shall the office becomes a woman best , i upon me if i prove let my tongue blister and never to my anger be the trumpet any more .
pray you , emilia , commend my best obedience to the queen if she dares trust me with her little babe , i the king and undertake to be her advocate to the .
we do not know how he may soften at the sight o ' the child the silence often of pure innocence persuades when speaking fails .
most worthy madam , your honour and your goodness is so evident that your free undertaking can not miss a thriving issue there is no lady living so meet for this great errand .
please your ladyship to visit the next room , i presently acquaint the queen of your most noble offer , who but hammer of this design , but durst not tempt a minister of honour , lest she should be denied .
tell her , emilia .
i use that tongue i have if wit flow as boldness from my bosom , let not be doubted i shall do good .
now be you blest for it !
i to the queen please you , come something nearer .
madam , please the queen to send the babe , i know not what i shall incur to pass it , having no warrant .
you need not fear it , sir this child was prisoner to the womb and is by law and process of great nature thence freed and enfranchised , not a party to the anger of the king nor guilty of , if any be , the trespass of the queen .
i do believe it .
do not you fear upon mine honour , i will stand betwixt you and danger .
exeunt scene iii .
a room in leontes ' palace .
enter leontes , antigonus , lords , and servants nor night nor day no rest it is but weakness to bear the matter thus , mere weakness .
if the cause were not in being , part o ' the cause , she the adulteress , for the harlot king is quite beyond mine arm , out of the blank and level of my brain , , but she i can hook to me say that she were gone , given to the fire , a moiety of my rest might come to me again .
who there ?
my lord ?
how does the boy ?
he took good rest , is hoped his sickness is discharged .
to see his nobleness !
conceiving the dishonour of his mother , he straight declined , droop , took it deeply , fasten and fix the shame o in himself , threw off his spirit , his appetite , his sleep , and downright languish .
leave me solely go , see how he fares .
exit servant fie , fie !
no thought of him the thought of my revenges that way recoil upon me in himself too mighty , and in his parties , his alliance , let him be until a time may serve for present vengeance , take it on her .
camillo and polixenes laugh at me , make their pastime at my sorrow they should not laugh if i could reach them , nor shall she within my power .
enter paulina , with a child you must not enter .
nay , rather , good my lords , be second to me fear you his tyrannous passion more , alas , than the queen life ?
a gracious innocent soul , more free than he is jealous .
that enough .
madam , he hath not slept tonight , commanded none should come at him .
not so hot , good sir i come to bring him sleep .
is such as you , that creep like shadows by him and do sigh at each his needless heavings , such as you nourish the cause of his awaking i do come with words as medicinal as true , honest as either , to purge him of that humour that presses him from sleep .
what noise there , ho ?
no noise , my lord , but needful conference about some gossips for your highness .
how !
away with that audacious lady !
antigonus , i charged thee that she should not come about me i knew she would .
i told her so , my lord , on your displeasure peril and on mine , she should not visit you .
what , canst not rule her ?
from all dishonesty he can in this , unless he take the course that you have done , commit me for committing honour , trust it , he shall not rule me .
la you now , you hear when she will take the rein i let her run , but she not stumble .
good my liege , i come , and , i beseech you , hear me , who profess myself your loyal servant , your physician , your most obedient counsellor , yet that dare less appear so in comforting your evils , than such as most seem yours i say , i come from your good queen .
good queen !
good queen , my lord , good queen , i say good queen , and would by combat make her good , so were i a man , the worst about you .
force her hence .
let him that makes but trifles of his eyes first hand me on mine own accord i off , but first i do my errand .
the good queen , for she is good , hath brought you forth a daughter , here is , commends it to your blessing .
laying down the child out !
a mankind witch !
hence with her , out o ' door a most intelligencing bawd !
not so i am as ignorant in that as you in so entitling me , and no less honest than you are mad , which is enough , i warrant , as this world goes , to pass for honest .
traitors !
will you not push her out ?
give her the bastard .
thou dotard !
thou art , unroosted by thy dame partlet here .
take up the bastard , up , i say , to thy crone .
for ever unvenerable be thy hands , if thou takest up the princess by that forced baseness which he has put upo !
he dreads his wife .
so i would you did , then past all doubt call your children yours .
a nest of traitors !
i am none , by this good light .
nor i , nor any but one that here , and that himself , for he the sacred honour of himself , his queen , his hopeful son , his babe , betrays to slander , whose sting is sharper than the sword , and will not for , as the case now stands , it is a curse he can not be compell once remove the root of his opinion , which is rotten as ever oak or stone was sound .
a callat of boundless tongue , who late hath beat her husband and now baits me !
this brat is none of mine , it is the issue of polixenes hence with it , and together with the dam commit them to the fire !
it is yours , and , might we lay the old proverb to your charge , so like you , is the worse .
behold , my lords , although the print be little , the whole matter and copy of the father , eye , nose , lip , the trick of frown , his forehead , nay , the valley , the pretty dimples of his chin and cheek , his smiles , the very mould and frame of hand , nail , finger and thou , good goddess nature , which hast made it so like to him that got it , if thou hast the ordering of the mind too , all colours no yellow i , lest she suspect , as he does , her children not her husband !
a gross hag and , lozel , thou art worthy to be hang , that wilt not stay her tongue .
hang all the husbands that can not do that feat , you leave yourself hardly one subject .
once more , take her hence .
a most unworthy and unnatural lord can do no more .
i ha ' thee burnt .
i care not it is an heretic that makes the fire , not she which burns i .
i not call you tyrant , but this most cruel usage of your queen , not able to produce more accusation than your own fancy , something savours of tyranny and will ignoble make you , yea , scandalous to the world .
on your allegiance , out of the chamber with her !
were i a tyrant , where were her life ?
she durst not call me so , if she did know me one .
away with her !
i pray you , do not push me , i be gone .
look to your babe , my lord , is yours jove send her a better guiding spirit !
what needs these hands ?
you , that are thus so tender his follies , will never do him good , not one of you .
so , so farewell , we are gone .
exit thou , traitor , hast set on thy wife to this .
my child ?
away !
even thou , that hast a heart so tender it , take it hence and see it instantly consumed with fire , even thou and none but thou .
take it up straight within this hour bring me word is done , and by good testimony , or i seize thy life , with what thou else thine .
if thou refuse and wilt encounter with my wrath , say so , the bastard brains with these my proper hands shall i dash out .
go , take it to the fire , for thou on thy wife .
i did not , sir these lords , my noble fellows , if they please , can clear me i .
we can my royal liege , he is not guilty of her coming hither .
you liars all .
beseech your highness , give us better credit we have always truly served you , and beseech you so to esteem of us , and on our knees we beg , as recompense of our dear services past and to come , that you do change this purpose , which being so horrible , so bloody , must lead on to some foul issue we all kneel .
i am a feather for each wind that blows shall i live on to see this bastard kneel and call me father ?
better burn it now than curse it then .
but be it , let it live .
it shall not neither .
you , sir , come you hither , you that have been so tenderly officious with lady margery , your midwife there , to save this bastard life , for is a bastard , so sure as this beard grey , what will you adventure to save this brat life ?
any thing , my lord , that my ability may undergo and nobleness impose at least thus much i pawn the little blood which i have left to save the innocent any thing possible .
it shall be possible .
swear by this sword thou wilt perform my bidding .
i will , my lord .
mark and perform it , thou !
for the fail of any point i shall not only be death to thyself but to thy wife , whom for this time we pardon .
we enjoin thee , as thou art to us , that thou carry this female bastard hence and that thou bear it to some remote and desert place quite out of our dominions , and that there thou leave it , without more mercy , to its own protection and favour of the climate .
as by strange fortune it came to us , i do in justice charge thee , on thy soul peril and thy body torture , that thou commend it strangely to some place where chance may nurse or end it .
take it up .
i swear to do this , though a present death had been more merciful .
come on , poor babe some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens to be thy nurses !
wolves and bears , they say casting their savageness aside have done like offices of pity .
sir , be prosperous in more than this deed does require !
and blessing against this cruelty fight on thy side , poor thing , condemn to loss !
exit with the child no , i not rear another issue .
enter a servant please your highness , posts from those you sent to the oracle are come an hour since cleomenes and dion , being well arrived from delphos , are both landed , hasting to the court .
so please you , sir , their speed hath been beyond account .
days they have been absent is good speed , foretells the great apollo suddenly will have the truth of this appear .
prepare you , lords , summon a session , that we may arraign our most disloyal lady , for , as she hath been publicly accused , so shall she have a just and open trial .
while she lives my heart will be a burthen to me .
leave me , and think upon my bidding .
exeunt act iii scene i .
a in sicilia .
enter cleomenes and dion the climate delicate , the air most sweet , fertile the isle , the temple much surpassing the common praise it bears .
i shall report , for most it caught me , the celestial habits , methinks i so should term them , and the reverence of the grave wearers .
o , the sacrifice !
how ceremonious , solemn and unearthly it was i ' the offering !
but of all , the burst and the voice o ' the oracle , kin to jove thunder , so surprised my sense .
that i was nothing .
if the event o ' the journey prove as successful to the queen , o so ! as it hath been to us rare , pleasant , speedy , the time is worth the use o .
great apollo turn all to the best !
these proclamations , so forcing faults upon hermione , i little like .
the violent carriage of it will clear or end the business when the oracle , thus by apollo great divine seal up , shall the contents discover , something rare even then will rush to knowledge .
go fresh horses !
and gracious be the issue !
exeunt scene ii .
a court of justice .
enter leontes , lords , and officers this sessions , to our great grief we pronounce , even pushes our heart the party tried the daughter of a king , our wife , and one of us too much beloved .
let us be clear of being tyrannous , since we so openly proceed in justice , which shall have due course , even to the guilt or the purgation .
produce the prisoner .
it is his highness ' pleasure that the queen appear in person here in court .
silence !
enter hermione guarded , paulina and ladies attending read the indictment .
reads hermione , queen to the worthy leontes , king of sicilia , thou art here accused and arraigned of high treason , in committing adultery with polixenes , king of bohemia , and conspiring with camillo to take away the life of our sovereign lord the king , thy royal husband the pretence whereof being by circumstances partly laid open , thou , hermione , contrary to the faith and allegiance of a true subject , didst counsel and aid them , for their better safety , to fly away by night .
since what i am to say must be but that which contradicts my accusation and the testimony on my part no other but what comes from myself , it shall scarce boot me to say guilty ' mine integrity being counted falsehood , shall , as i express it , be so received .
but thus if powers divine behold our human actions , as they do , i doubt not then but innocence shall make false accusation blush and tyranny tremble at patience .
you , my lord , best know , who least will seem to do so , my past life hath been as continent , as chaste , as true , as i am now unhappy , which is more than history can pattern , though devised and play to take spectators .
for behold me a fellow of the royal bed , which owe a moiety of the throne a great king daughter , the mother to a hopeful prince , here standing to prate and talk for life and honour who please to come and hear .
for life , i prize it as i weigh grief , which i would spare for honour , is a derivative from me to mine , and only that i stand for .
i appeal to your own conscience , sir , before polixenes came to your court , how i was in your grace , how merited to be so , since he came , with what encounter so uncurrent i have strain to appear thus if one jot beyond the bound of honour , or in act or will that way inclining , harden be the hearts of all that hear me , and my of kin cry fie upon my grave !
i heard yet that any of these bolder vices wanted less impudence to gainsay what they did than to perform it first .
that true enough , through is a saying , sir , not due to me .
you will not own it .
more than mistress of which comes to me in name of fault , i must not at all acknowledge .
for polixenes , with whom i am accused , i do confess i loved him as in honour he required , with such a kind of love as might become a lady like me , with a love even such , so and no other , as yourself commanded which not to have done i think had been in me both disobedience and ingratitude to you and toward your friend , whose love had spoke , even since it could speak , from an infant , freely that it was yours .
now , for conspiracy , i know not how it tastes , though it be dish for me to try how all i know of it is that camillo was an honest man , and why he left your court , the gods themselves , wotting no more than i , are ignorant .
you knew of his departure , as you know what you have to do in absence .
sir , you speak a language that i understand not my life stands in the level of your dreams , which i lay down .
your actions are my dreams , you had a bastard by polixenes , and i but dream it .
as you were past all shame , those of your fact are so so past all truth which to deny concerns more than avails , for as thy brat hath been cast out , like to itself , no father owning it , which is , indeed , more criminal in thee than it , so thou shalt feel our justice , in whose easiest passage look for no less than death .
sir , spare your threats the bug which you would fright me with i seek .
to me can life be no commodity the crown and comfort of my life , your favour , i do give lost , for i do feel it gone , but know not how it went .
my second joy and of my body , from his presence i am barr , like one infectious .
my third comfort starr most unluckily , is from my breast , the innocent milk in its most innocent mouth , haled out to murder myself on every post proclaimed a strumpet with immodest hatred the privilege denied , which to women of all fashion , lastly , hurried here to this place , i ' the open air , before i have got strength of limit .
now , my liege , tell me what blessings i have here alive , that i should fear to die ?
therefore proceed .
but yet hear this mistake me not , no life , i prize it not a straw , but for mine honour , which i would free , if i shall be condemn upon surmises , all proofs sleeping else but what your jealousies awake , i tell you is rigor and not law .
your honours all , i do refer me to the oracle apollo be my judge !
this your request is altogether just therefore bring forth , and in apollos name , his oracle .
exeunt certain officers the emperor of russia was my father o that he were alive , and here beholding his daughter trial !
that he did but see the flatness of my misery , yet with eyes of pity , not revenge !
officers , with cleomenes and dion you here shall swear upon this sword of justice , that you , cleomenes and dion , have been both at delphos , and from thence have brought the oracle , by the hand deliver of great apollo priest , and that , since then , you have not dared to break the holy seal nor read the secrets i .
all this we swear .
break up the seals and read .
reads hermione is chaste , polixenes blameless , camillo a true subject , leontes a jealous tyrant , his innocent babe truly begotten , and the king shall live without an heir , if that which is lost be not found .
now blessed be the great apollo !
praised !
hast thou read truth ?
ay , my lord , even so as it is here set down .
there is no truth at all i ' the oracle the sessions shall proceed this is mere falsehood .
enter servant my lord the king , the king !
what is the business ?
o sir , i shall be hated to report it !
the prince your son , with mere conceit and fear of the queen speed , is gone .
how !
gone !
is dead .
apollo angry , and the heavens themselves do strike at my injustice .
hermione swoons how now there !
this news is mortal to the queen look down and see what death is doing .
take her hence her heart is but , she will recover i have too much believed mine own suspicion beseech you , tenderly apply to her some remedies for life .
exeunt paulina and ladies , with hermione apollo , pardon my great profaneness thine oracle !
i reconcile me to polixenes , new woo my queen , recall the good camillo , whom i proclaim a man of truth , of mercy , for , being transported by my jealousies to bloody thoughts and to revenge , i chose camillo for the minister to poison my friend polixenes which had been done , but that the good mind of camillo tardied my swift command , though i with death and with reward did threaten and encourage him , not doing and being done he , most humane and fill with honour , to my kingly guest unclasp my practise , quit his fortunes here , which you knew great , and to the hazard of all encertainties himself commended , no richer than his honour how he glisters thorough my rust !
and how his pity does my deeds make the blacker !
paulina woe the while !
o , cut my lace , lest my heart , cracking it , break too .
what fit is this , good lady ?
what studied torments , tyrant , hast for me ?
what wheels ?
racks ?
fires ?
what flaying ?
boiling ?
in leads or oils ?
what old or newer torture must i receive , whose every word deserves to taste of thy most worst ?
thy tyranny together working with thy jealousies , fancies too weak for boys , too green and idle for girls of nine , o , think what they have done and then run mad indeed , stark mad !
for all thy fooleries were but spices of it .
that thou polixenes , was nothing , that did but show thee , of a fool , inconstant and damnable ingrateful nor much , thou wouldst have poison good camillo honour , to have him kill a king poor trespasses , more monstrous standing by whereof i reckon the casting forth to crows thy to be or none or little , though a devil would have shed water out of fire ere nor directly laid to thee , the death of the young prince , whose honourable thoughts , thoughts high for one so tender , cleft the heart that could conceive a gross and foolish sire blemish his gracious dam this is not , no , laid to thy answer but the last , o lords , when i have said , cry ! '
the queen , the queen , the , creature dead , and vengeance not dropp down yet .
the higher powers forbid !
i say she dead , i .
if word nor oath prevail not , go and see if you can bring tincture or lustre in her lip , her eye , heat outwardly or breath within , i serve you as i would do the gods .
but , o thou tyrant !
do not repent these things , for they are heavier than all thy woes can stir , therefore betake thee to nothing but despair .
a thousand knees ten thousand years together , naked , fasting , upon a barren mountain and still winter in storm perpetual , could not move the gods to look that way thou wert .
go on , go on thou canst not speak too much , i have deserved all tongues to talk their bitterest .
say no more the business goes , you have made fault i ' the boldness of your speech .
i am sorry all faults i make , when i shall come to know them , i do repent .
alas !
i have show too much the rashness of a woman he is touch to the noble heart .
what gone and what past help should be past grief do not receive affliction at my petition , i beseech you , rather let me be punish , that have minded you of what you should forget .
now , good my liege sir , royal sir , forgive a foolish woman the love i bore your queen lo , fool again ! i speak of her no more , nor of your children , i not remember you of my own lord , who is lost too take your patience to you , and i say nothing .
thou didst speak but well when most the truth , which i receive much better than to be pitied of thee .
prithee , bring me to the dead bodies of my queen and son one grave shall be for both upon them shall the causes of their death appear , unto our shame perpetual .
once a day i visit the chapel where they lie , and tears shed there shall be my recreation so long as nature will bear up with this exercise , so long i daily vow to use it .
come and lead me unto these sorrows .
exeunt scene iii .
bohemia .
a desert country near the sea .
enter antigonus with a child , and a mariner thou art perfect then , our ship hath touch upon the deserts of bohemia ?
ay , my lord and fear we have landed in ill time the skies look grimly and threaten present blusters .
in my conscience , the heavens with that we have in hand are angry and frown upon .
their sacred wills be done !
go , get aboard , look to thy bark i not be long before i call upon thee .
make your best haste , and go not too far i ' the land is like to be loud weather , besides , this place is famous for the creatures of prey that keep upo .
go thou away i follow instantly .
i am glad at heart to be so rid o ' the business .
exit come , poor babe i have heard , but not believed , the spirits o ' the dead may walk again if such thing be , thy mother appear to me last night , for was dream so like a waking .
to me comes a creature , sometimes her head on one side , some another , i never saw a vessel of like sorrow , so fill and so becoming in pure white robes , like very sanctity , she did approach my cabin where i lay , thrice bow before me , and gasping to begin some speech , her eyes became two spouts the fury spent , anon did this her antigonus , since fate , against thy better disposition , hath made thy person for the of my poor babe , according to thine oath , places remote enough are in bohemia , there weep and leave it crying , and , for the babe is counted lost for ever , perdita , i prithee , .
for this ungentle business put on thee by my lord , thou shalt see thy wife paulina more . '
and so , with shrieks she melted into air .
affrighted much , i did in time collect myself and thought this was so and no slumber .
dreams are toys yet for this once , yea , superstitiously , i will be squared by this .
i do believe hermione hath suffer death , and that apollo would , this being indeed the issue of king polixenes , it should here be laid , either for life or death , upon the earth of its right father .
blossom , speed thee well !
there lie , and there thy character there these , which may , if fortune please , both breed thee , pretty , and still rest thine .
the storm begins , poor wretch , that for thy mother fault art thus exposed to loss and what may follow !
weep i can not , but my heart bleeds , and most accursed am i to be by oath enjoin to this .
farewell !
the day frowns more and more like to have a lullaby too rough i never saw the heavens so dim by day .
a savage clamour !
well may i get aboard !
this is the chase i am gone for ever .
exit , pursued by a bear enter a shepherd i would there were no age between sixteen and , or that youth would sleep out the rest , for there is nothing in the between but getting wenches with child , wronging the ancientry , stealing , fighting hark you now !
would any but these boiled brains of nineteen and hunt this weather ?
they have scared away two of my best sheep , which i fear the wolf will sooner find than the master if any where i have them , is by the seaside , browsing of ivy .
good luck , a be thy will what have we here !
mercy on , a barne a very pretty barne !
a boy or a child , i wonder ?
a pretty one , a very pretty one sure , some though i am not bookish , yet i can read in the .
this has been some , some , some they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here .
i take it up for pity yet i tarry till my son come , he hallooed but even now .
whoa , ho , hoa !
enter clown hilloa , loa !
what , art so near ?
if see a thing to talk on when thou art dead and rotten , come hither .
what ailest thou , man ?
i have seen two such sights , by sea and by land !
but i am not to say it is a sea , for it is now the sky betwixt the firmament and it you can not thrust a bodkin point .
why , boy , how is it ?
i would you did but see how it chafes , how it rages , how it takes up the shore !
but that not the point .
o , the most piteous cry of the poor souls !
sometimes to see , and not to see , now the ship boring the moon with her , and anon swallowed with yest and froth , as thrust a cork into a hogshead .
and then for the , to see how the bear tore out his , how he cried to me for help and said his name was antigonus , a nobleman .
but to make an end of the ship , to see how the sea it but , first , how the poor souls roared , and the sea mocked them , and how the poor gentleman roared and the bear mocked him , both roaring louder than the sea or weather .
name of mercy , when was this , boy ?
now , now i have not winked since i saw these sights the men are not yet cold under water , nor the bear half dined on the gentleman he at it now .
would i had been by , to have helped the old man !
i would you had been by the ship side , to have helped her there your charity would have lacked footing .
heavy matters !
heavy matters !
but look thee here , boy .
now bless thyself thou mettest with things dying , i with things newborn .
here a sight for thee , look thee , a for a squire child !
look thee here , take up , take up , boy , ope .
so , let see it was told me i should be rich by the fairies .
this is some changeling ope .
what within , boy ?
you a made old man if the sins of your youth are forgiven you , you well to live .
gold !
all gold !
this is fairy gold , boy , and prove so up , keep it close home , home , the next way .
we are lucky , boy , and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy .
let my sheep go come , good boy , the next way home .
go you the next way with your findings .
i go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much he hath eaten they are never curst but when they are hungry if there be any of him left , i bury it .
that a good deed .
if thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is , fetch me to the sight of him .
marry , will i , and you shall help to put him i ' the ground .
is a lucky day , boy , and we do good deeds o .
exeunt act iv scene i enter time , the chorus i , that please some , try all , both joy and terror of good and bad , that makes and unfolds error , now take upon me , in the name of time , to use my wings .
impute it not a crime to me or my swift passage , that i slide sixteen years and leave the growth untried of that wide gap , since it is in my power to law and in one hour to plant and custom .
let me pass the same i am , ere order was or what is now received i witness to the times that brought them in , so shall i do to the freshest things now reigning and make stale the glistering of this present , as my tale now seems to it .
your patience this allowing , i turn my glass and give my scene such growing as you had slept between leontes leaving , the effects of his fond jealousies so grieving that he shuts up himself , imagine me , gentle spectators , that i now may be in fair bohemia , and remember well , i mentioned a son o ' the king , which florizel i now name to you , and with speed so pace to speak of perdita , now grown in grace equal with wondering what of her ensues i list not prophecy , but let time news be known when is brought forth .
a shepherd daughter , and what to her adheres , which follows after , is the argument of time .
of this allow , if ever you have spent time worse ere now , if never , yet that time himself doth say he wishes earnestly you never may .
exit scene ii .
bohemia .
the palace of polixenes .
enter polixenes and camillo i pray thee , good camillo , be no more importunate is a sickness denying thee any thing , a death to grant this .
it is fifteen years since i saw my country though i have for the most part been aired abroad , i desire to lay my bones there .
besides , the penitent king , my master , hath sent for me , to whose feeling sorrows i might be some allay , or i to think so , which is another spur to my departure .
as thou lovest me , camillo , wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now the need i have of thee thine own goodness hath made , better not to have had thee than thus to want thee thou , having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage , must either stay to execute them thyself or take away with thee the very services thou hast done , which if i have not enough considered , as too much i can not , to be more thankful to thee shall be my study , and my profit therein the heaping friendships .
of that fatal country , sicilia , prithee speak no more , whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent , as thou callest him , and reconciled king , my brother , whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented .
say to me , when sawest thou the prince florizel , my son ?
kings are no less unhappy , their issue not being gracious , than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues .
sir , it is three days since i saw the prince .
what his happier affairs may be , are to me unknown but i have missingly noted , he is of late much retired from court and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared .
i have considered so much , camillo , and with some care , so far that i have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness , from whom i have this intelligence , that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd , a man , they say , that from very nothing , and beyond the imagination of his neighbours , is grown into an unspeakable estate .
i have heard , sir , of such a man , who hath a daughter of most rare note the report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage .
that likewise part of my intelligence , but , i fear , the angle that plucks our son thither .
thou shalt accompany us to the place , where we will , not appearing what we are , have some question with the shepherd , from whose simplicity i think it not uneasy to get the cause of my son resort thither .
prithee , be my present partner in this business , and lay aside the thoughts of sicilia .
i willingly obey your command .
my best camillo !
we must disguise ourselves .
exeunt scene iii .
a road near the shepherd cottage .
enter autolycus , singing when daffodils begin to peer , with heigh !
the doxy over the dale , why , then comes in the sweet o ' the year , for the red blood reigns in the winter pale .
the white sheet bleaching on the hedge , with heigh !
the sweet birds , o , how they sing !
doth set my pugging tooth on edge , for a quart of ale is a dish for a king .
the lark , that chants , with heigh !
with heigh !
the thrush and the jay , are summer songs for me and my aunts , while we lie tumbling in the hay .
i have served prince florizel and in my time wore , but now i am out of service but shall i go mourn for that , my dear ?
the pale moon shines by night and when i wander here and there , i then do most go right .
if tinkers may have leave to live , and bear the budget , then my account i well may , give , and in the stocks avouch it .
my traffic is sheets , when the kite builds , look to lesser linen .
my father named me autolycus , who being , as i am , littered under mercury , was likewise a of unconsidered trifles .
with die and drab i purchased this caparison , and my revenue is the silly cheat .
gallows and knock are too powerful on the highway beating and hanging are terrors to me for the life to come , i sleep out the thought of it .
a prize !
a prize !
enter clown let me see every wether tods , every tod yields pound and odd shilling , fifteen hundred shorn .
what comes the wool to ?
aside if the springe hold , the cock mine .
i can not without counters .
let me see , what am i to buy for our feast ?
three pound of sugar , five pound of currants , rice , what will this sister of mine do with rice ?
but my father hath made her mistress of the feast , and she lays it on .
she hath made me four and twenty for the shearers , all , and very good ones , but they are most of them means and bases , but one puritan amongst them , and he sings psalms to .
i must have saffron to colour the warden pies , mace , dates ? none , that out of my note , nutmegs , seven , a race or two of ginger , but that i may beg , four pound of prunes , and as many of raisins o ' the sun .
o that ever i was born !
grovelling on the ground i ' the name of me o , help me , help me !
pluck but off these rags , and then , death , death !
alack , poor soul !
thou hast need of more rags to lay on thee , rather than have these off .
o sir , the loathsomeness of them offends me more than the stripes i have received , which are mighty ones and millions .
alas , poor man !
a million of beating may come to a great matter .
i am robbed , sir , and beaten , my money and apparel from me , and these detestable things put upon me .
what , by a horseman , or a footman ?
a footman , sweet sir , a footman .
indeed , he should be a footman by the garments he has left with thee if this be a horseman coat , it hath seen very hot service .
lend me thy hand , i help thee come , lend me thy hand .
o , good sir , tenderly , o !
alas , poor soul !
o , good sir , softly , good sir !
i fear , sir , my is out .
how now !
canst stand ?
picking his pocket softly , dear sir , good sir , softly .
you ha ' done me a charitable office .
dost lack any money ?
i have a little money for thee .
no , good sweet sir , no , i beseech you , sir i have a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence , unto whom i was going , i shall there have money , or any thing i want offer me no money , i pray you , that kills my heart .
what manner of fellow was he that robbed you ?
a fellow , sir , that i have known to go about with , i knew him once a servant of the prince i can not tell , good sir , for which of his virtues it was , but he was certainly whipped out of the court .
his vices , you would say , there no virtue whipped out of the court they cherish it to make it stay there , and yet it will no more but abide .
vices , i would say , sir .
i know this man well he hath been since an , then a , a bailiff , then he compassed a motion of the prodigal son , and married a tinker wife within a mile where my land and living lies , and , having flown over many knavish professions , he settled only in rogue some call him autolycus .
out upon him !
prig , for my life , prig he haunts wakes , fairs and .
very true , sir , he , sir , he , that the rogue that put me into this apparel .
not a more cowardly rogue in all bohemia if you had but looked big and spit at him , have run .
i must confess to you , sir , i am no fighter i am false of heart that way , and that he knew , i warrant him .
how do you now ?
sweet sir , much better than i was , i can stand and walk i will even take my leave of you , and pace softly towards my kinsman .
shall i bring thee on the way ?
no , sir , no , sweet sir .
then fare thee well i must go buy spices for our .
prosper you , sweet sir !
exit clown your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice .
i be with you at your too if i make not this cheat bring out another and the shearers prove sheep , let me be unrolled and my name put in the book of virtue !

enter florizel and perdita these your unusual weeds to each part of you do give a life no shepherdess , but flora peering in april front .
this your is as a meeting of the petty gods , and you the queen o .
sir , my gracious lord , to chide at your extremes it not becomes me o , pardon , that i name them !
your high self , the gracious mark o ' the land , you have obscured with a swain wearing , and me , poor lowly maid , most prank up but that our feasts in every mess have folly and the feeders digest it with a custom , i should blush to see you so attired , sworn , i think , to show myself a glass .
i bless the time when my good falcon made her flight across thy father ground .
now jove afford you cause !
to me the difference forges dread , your greatness hath not been used to fear .
even now i tremble to think your father , by some accident , should pass this way as you did o , the fates !
how would he look , to see his work so noble vilely bound up ?
what would he say ?
or how should i , in these my borrow flaunts , behold the sternness of his presence ?
apprehend nothing but jollity .
the gods themselves , humbling their deities to love , have taken the shapes of beasts upon them jupiter became a bull , and bellow , the green neptune a ram , and bleated , and the god , golden apollo , a poor humble swain , as i seem now .
their transformations were never for a piece of beauty rarer , nor in a way so chaste , since my desires run not before mine honour , nor my lusts burn hotter than my faith .
o , but , sir , your resolution can not hold , when is opposed , as it must be , by the power of the king one of these two must be necessities , which then will speak , that you must change this purpose , or i my life .
thou dearest perdita , with these forced thoughts , i prithee , darken not the mirth o ' the feast .
or i be thine , my fair , or not my father .
for i can not be mine own , nor any thing to any , if i be not thine .
to this i am most constant , though destiny say no .
be merry , gentle , strangle such thoughts as these with any thing that you behold the while .
your guests are coming lift up your countenance , as it were the day of celebration of that nuptial which we two have sworn shall come .
o lady fortune , stand you auspicious !
see , your guests approach address yourself to entertain them sprightly , and let be red with mirth .
enter shepherd , clown , mopsa , dorcas , and others , with polixenes and camillo disguised fie , daughter !
when my old wife lived , upon this day she was both pantler , butler , cook , both dame and servant , welcomed all , served all , would sing her song and dance her turn , now here , at upper end o ' the table , now i ' the middle , on his shoulder , and his , her face o ' fire with labour and the thing she took to quench it , she would to each one sip .
you are retired , as if you were a feasted one and not the hostess of the meeting pray you , bid these unknown friends to welcome , for it is a way to make us better friends , more known .
come , quench your blushes and present yourself that which you are , mistress o ' the feast come on , and bid us welcome to your , as your good flock shall prosper .
to polixenes sir , welcome it is my father will i should take on me the o ' the day .
to camillo you welcome , sir .
give me those flowers there , dorcas .
reverend sirs , for you there rosemary and rue , these keep seeming and savour all the winter long grace and remembrance be to you both , and welcome to our shearing !
shepherdess , a fair one are you well you fit our ages with flowers of winter .
sir , the year growing ancient , not yet on summer death , nor on the birth of trembling winter , the fairest flowers o ' the season are our carnations and streak gillyvors , which some call nature bastards of that kind our rustic garden barren , and i care not to get slips of them .
wherefore , gentle maiden , do you neglect them ?
for i have heard it said there is an art which in their piedness shares with great creating nature .
say there be , yet nature is made better by no mean but nature makes that mean so , over that art which you say adds to nature , is an art that nature makes .
you see , sweet maid , we marry a gentler scion to the wildest stock , and make conceive a bark of baser kind by bud of nobler race this is an art which does mend nature , change it rather , but the art itself is nature .
so it is .
then make your garden rich in gillyvors , and do not call them bastards .
i not put the dibble in earth to set one slip of them , no more than were i painted i would wish this youth should say well and only therefore desire to breed by me .
here flowers for you , hot lavender , mints , savoury , marjoram , the marigold , that goes to bed wi ' the sun and with him rises weeping these are flowers of middle summer , and i think they are given to men of middle age .
you very welcome .
i should leave grazing , were i of your flock , and only live by gazing .
out , alas !
you be so lean , that blasts of january would blow you through and through .
now , my friend , i would i had some flowers o ' the spring that might become your time of day , and yours , and yours , that wear upon your virgin branches yet your maidenheads growing o proserpina , for the flowers now , that frighted thou fall from dis waggon !
daffodils , that come before the swallow dares , and take the winds of march with beauty , violets dim , but sweeter than the lids of juno eyes or cytherea breath , pale primroses that die unmarried , ere they can behold bight phoebus in his strength a malady most incident to maids , bold oxlips and the crown imperial , lilies of all kinds , the being one !
o , these i lack , to make you garlands of , and my sweet friend , to strew him and !
what , like a corse ?
no , like a bank for love to lie and play on , not like a corse , or if , not to be buried , but quick and in mine arms .
come , take your flowers methinks i play as i have seen them do in whitsun pastorals sure this robe of mine does change my disposition .
what you do still betters what is done .
when you speak , sweet .
have you do it ever when you sing , have you buy and sell so , so give alms , pray so , and , for the ordering your affairs , to sing them too when you do dance , i wish you a wave o ' the sea , that you might ever do nothing but that , move still , still so , and own no other function each your doing , so singular in each particular , crowns what you are doing in the present deed , that all your acts are queens .
o doricles , your praises are too large but that your youth , and the true blood which peepeth fairly , do plainly give you out an unstain shepherd , with wisdom i might fear , my doricles , you woo me the false way .
i think you have as little skill to fear as i have purpose to put you .
but come , our dance , i pray your hand , my perdita so turtles pair , that never mean to part .
i swear for .
this is the prettiest lass that ever ran on the nothing she does or seems but smacks of something greater than herself , too noble for this place .
he tells her something that makes her blood look out good sooth , she is the queen of curds and cream .
come on , strike up !
mopsa must be your mistress marry , garlic , to mend her kissing with !
now , in good time !
not a word , a word , we stand upon our manners .
come , strike up !
music .
here a dance of shepherds and shepherdesses pray , good shepherd , what fair swain is this which dances with your daughter ?
they call him doricles , and boasts himself to have a worthy feeding but i have it upon his own report and i believe it , he looks like sooth .
he says he loves my daughter i think so too , for never gazed the moon upon the water as he stand and read as my daughter eyes and , to be plain .
i think there is not half a kiss to choose who loves another best .
she dances featly .
so she does any thing , though i report it , that should be silent if young doricles do light upon her , she shall bring him that which he not dreams of .
enter servant o master , if you did but hear the pedlar at the door , you would never dance again after a tabour and pipe , no , the bagpipe could not move you he sings several tunes faster than you tell money , he utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men ears grew to his tunes .
he could never come better , he shall come in .
i love a ballad but even too well , if it be doleful matter merrily set down , or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably .
he hath songs for man or woman , of all sizes , no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves he has the prettiest for maids , so without bawdry , which is strange , with such delicate burthens of dildos and fadings , her and thump her , ' and where some rascal would , as it were , mean mischief and break a foul gap into the matter , he makes the maid to answer , do me no harm , good man , ' puts him off , slights him , with , do me no harm , good man . '
this is a brave fellow .
believe me , thou talkest of an admirable conceited fellow .
has he any unbraided wares ?
he hath ribbons of an the colours i ' the rainbow , points more than all the lawyers in bohemia can learnedly handle , though they come to him by the gross inkles , caddisses , cambrics , lawns why , he sings over as they were gods or goddesses , you would think a smock were a , he so chants to the and the work about the square o .
prithee bring him in , and let him approach singing .
forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in tunes .
exit servant you have of these pedlars , that have more in them than think , sister .
ay , good brother , or go about to think .
enter autolycus , singing lawn as white as driven snow , cyprus black as was crow , gloves as sweet as damask roses , masks for faces and for noses , bugle bracelet , necklace amber , perfume for a lady chamber , golden quoifs and stomachers , for my lads to give their dears pins and of steel , what maids lack from head to heel come buy of me , come , come buy , come buy , buy lads , or else your lasses cry come buy .
if i were not in love with mopsa , thou shouldst take no money of me , but being enthralled as i am , it will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves .
i was promised them against the feast , but they come not too late now .
he hath promised you more than that , or there be liars .
he hath paid you all he promised you , may be , he has paid you more , which will shame you to give him again .
is there no manners left among maids ?
will they wear their plackets where they should bear their faces ?
is there not , when you are going to bed , or , to whistle off these secrets , but you must be before all our guests ?
is well they are whispering clamour your tongues , and not a word more .
i have done .
come , you promised me a and a pair of sweet gloves .
have i not told thee how i was cozened by the way and lost all my money ?
and indeed , sir , there are cozeners abroad , therefore it behoves men to be wary .
fear not thou , man , thou shalt lose nothing here .
i hope so , sir , for i have about me many parcels of charge .
what hast here ?
ballads ?
pray now , buy some i love a ballad in print o ' life , for then we are sure they are true .
here one to a very doleful tune , how a usurer wife was brought to bed of twenty at a burthen and how she longed to eat adders ' heads and toads carbonadoed .
is it true , think you ?
very true , and but a month old .

here another ballad of a fish , that appeared upon the coast on wednesday the of april , forty thousand fathom above water , and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids it was thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that loved her the ballad is very pitiful and as true .
is it true too , think you ?
five justices ' hands at it , and witnesses more than my pack will hold .
lay it by too another .
this is a merry ballad , but a very pretty one .
let have some merry ones .
why , this is a passing merry one and goes to the tune of maids wooing a man ' there scarce a maid westward but she sings it , is in request , i can tell you .
we can both sing it if bear a part , thou shalt hear , is in three parts .
we had the tune o a month ago .
i can bear my part , you must know is my occupation , have at it with you .
song get you hence , for i must go where it fits not you to know .

what , neither ?
neither .
thou hast sworn my love to be .

exit servant master , there is three carters , three shepherds , three , three , that have made themselves all men of hair , they call themselves saltiers , and they have a dance which the wenches say is a gallimaufry of gambols , because they are not i , but they themselves are o ' the mind , if it be not too rough for some that know little but bowling , it will please plentifully .
away !
we none on here has been too much homely foolery already .
i know , sir , we weary you .
you weary those that refresh us pray , let see these four threes of herdsmen .
one three of them , by their own report , sir , hath danced before the king , and not the worst of the three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier .
leave your prating since these good men are pleased , let them come in , but quickly now .
why , they stay at door , sir .
exit here a dance of twelve satyrs o , father , you know more of that hereafter .
to camillo is it not too far gone ?
is time to part them .
he simple and tells much .
to florizel how now , fair shepherd !
your heart is full of something that does take your mind from feasting .
sooth , when i was young and handed love as you do , i was wont to load my she with knacks i would have ransack the pedlar silken treasury and have pour it to her acceptance , you have let him go and nothing marted with him .
if your lass interpretation should abuse and call this your lack of love or bounty , you were straited for a reply , at least if you make a care of happy holding her .
old sir , i know she prizes not such trifles as these are the gifts she looks from me are pack and lock up in my heart , which i have given already , but not deliver .
o , hear me breathe my life before this ancient sir , who , it should seem , hath sometime loved !
i take thy hand , this hand , as soft as dove down and as white as it , or ethiopian tooth , or the fann snow that bolted by the northern blasts twice .
what follows this ?
how prettily the young swain seems to wash the hand was fair before !
i have put you out but to your protestation , let me hear what you profess .
do , and be witness to .
and this my neighbour too ?
and he , and more than he , and men , the earth , the heavens , and all that , were i crown the most imperial monarch , thereof most worthy , were i the fairest youth that ever made eye swerve , had force and knowledge more than was ever man , i would not prize them without her love , for her employ them all , commend them and condemn them to her service or to their own perdition .
fairly offer .
this shows a sound affection .
but , my daughter , say you the like to him ?
i can not speak so well , nothing so well , no , nor mean better by the pattern of mine own thoughts i cut out the purity of his .
take hands , a bargain !
and , friends unknown , you shall bear witness to i give my daughter to him , and will make her portion equal his .
o , that must be i ' the virtue of your daughter one being dead , i shall have more than you can dream of yet , enough then for your wonder .
but , come on , contract us these witnesses .
come , your hand , and , daughter , yours .
soft , swain , awhile , beseech you , have you a father ?
i have but what of him ?
knows he of this ?
he neither does nor shall .
methinks a father is at the nuptial of his son a guest that best becomes the table .
pray you once more , is not your father grown incapable of reasonable affairs ?
is he not stupid with age and altering rheums ?
can he speak ?
hear ?
know man from man ?
dispute his own estate ?
lies he not ?
and again does nothing but what he did being childish ?
no , good sir , he has his health and ampler strength indeed than most have of his age .
by my white beard , you offer him , if this be so , a wrong something unfilial reason my son should choose himself a wife , but as good reason the father , all whose joy is nothing else but fair posterity , should hold some counsel in such a business .
i yield all this , but for some other reasons , my grave sir , which is not fit you know , i not acquaint my father of this business .
let him .
he shall not .
prithee , let him .
no , he must not .
let him , my son he shall not need to grieve at knowing of thy choice .
come , come , he must not .
mark our contract .
mark your divorce , young sir , discovering himself whom son i dare not call , thou art too base to be acknowledged thou a sceptre heir , that thus a !
thou old traitor , i am sorry that by hanging thee i can but shorten thy life one week .
and thou , fresh piece of excellent witchcraft , who of force must know the royal fool thou copest with , o , my heart !
i have thy beauty scratch with briers , and made more homely than thy state .
for thee , fond boy , if i may ever know thou dost but sigh that thou no more shalt see this knack , as never i mean thou shalt , we bar thee from succession , not hold thee of our blood , no , not our kin , far than deucalion off mark thou my words follow us to the court .
thou churl , for this time , though full of our displeasure , yet we free thee from the dead blow of it .
and you , worthy enough a herdsman yea , him too , that makes himself , but for our honour therein , unworthy thee , if ever henceforth thou these rural latches to his entrance open , or hoop his body more with thy embraces , i will devise a death as cruel for thee as thou art tender .
exit even here undone !
i was not much afeard , for once or twice i was about to speak and tell him plainly , the selfsame sun that shines upon his court hides not his visage from our cottage but looks on alike .
please you , sir , be gone ?
i told you what would come of this beseech you , of your own state take care this dream of mine , being now awake , i queen it no inch farther , but milk my ewes and weep .
why , how now , father !
speak ere thou diest .
i can not speak , nor think nor dare to know that which i know .
o sir !
you have undone a man of fourscore three , that thought to fill his grave in quiet , yea , to die upon the bed my father died , to lie close by his honest bones but now some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me where no priest shovels in dust .
o cursed wretch , that this was the prince , and wouldst adventure to mingle faith with him !
undone !
undone !
if i might die within this hour , i have lived to die when i desire .
exit why look you so upon me ?
i am but sorry , not afeard , delay , but nothing alter what i was , i am , more straining on for plucking back , not following my leash unwillingly .
gracious my lord , you know your father temper at this time he will allow no speech , which i do guess you do not purpose to him , and as hardly will he endure your sight as yet , i fear then , till the fury of his highness settle , come not before him .
i not purpose it .
i think , camillo ?
even he , my lord .
how often have i told you be thus !
how often said , my dignity would last but till known !
it can not fail but by the violation of my faith , and then let nature crush the sides o ' the earth together and mar the seeds within !
lift up thy looks from my succession wipe me , father , i am heir to my affection .
be advised .
i am , and by my fancy if my reason will thereto be obedient , i have reason , if not , my senses , better pleased with madness , do bid it welcome .
this is desperate , sir .
so call it but it does fulfil my vow , i needs must think it honesty .
camillo , not for bohemia , nor the pomp that may be thereat glean , for all the sun sees or the close earth wombs or the profound sea hides in unknown fathoms , will i break my oath to this my fair beloved therefore , i pray you , as you have ever been my father honour friend , when he shall miss me , as , in faith , i mean not to see him any more , cast your good counsels upon his passion , let myself and fortune tug for the time to come .
this you may know and so deliver , i am put to sea with her whom here i can not hold on shore , and most opportune to our need i have a vessel rides fast by , but not prepared for this design .
what course i mean to hold shall nothing benefit your knowledge , nor concern me the reporting .
o my lord !
i would your spirit were easier for advice , or stronger for your need .
hark , perdita drawing her aside i hear you by and by .
he irremoveable , resolved for flight .
now were i happy , if his going i could frame to serve my turn , save him from danger , do him love and honour , purchase the sight again of dear sicilia and that unhappy king , my master , whom i so much thirst to see .
now , good camillo , i am so fraught with curious business that i leave out ceremony .
sir , i think you have heard of my poor services , i ' the love that i have borne your father ?
very nobly have you deserved it is my father music to speak your deeds , not little of his care to have them recompensed as thought on .
well , my lord , if you may please to think i love the king and through him what is nearest to him , which is your gracious self , embrace but my direction if your more ponderous and settled project may suffer alteration , on mine honour , i point you where you shall have such receiving as shall become your highness , where you may enjoy your mistress , from the whom , i see , there no disjunction to be made , but by as heavens forefend ! your ruin , marry her , and , with my best endeavours in your absence , your discontenting father strive to qualify and bring him up to liking .
how , camillo , may this , almost a miracle , be done ?
that i may call thee something more than man and after that trust to thee .
have you thought on a place whereto you go ?
not any yet but as the accident is guilty to what we wildly do , so we profess ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies of every wind that blows .
then list to me this follows , if you will not change your purpose but undergo this flight , make for sicilia , and there present yourself and your fair princess , for so i see she must be , leontes she shall be habited as it becomes the partner of your bed .
methinks i see leontes opening his free arms and weeping his welcomes forth , asks thee the son forgiveness , as i ' the father person , kisses the hands of your fresh princess , and divides him his unkindness and his kindness , the one he chides to hell and bids the other grow faster than thought or time .
worthy camillo , what colour for my visitation shall i hold up before him ?
sent by the king your father to greet him and to give him comforts .
sir , the manner of your bearing towards him , with what you as from your father shall deliver , things known betwixt us three , i write you down the which shall point you forth at every sitting what you must say , that he shall not perceive but that you have your father bosom there and speak his very heart .
i am bound to you there is some sap in this .
a cause more promising than a wild dedication of yourselves to unpath waters , undream shores , most certain to miseries enough , no hope to help you , but as you shake off one to take another , nothing so certain as your anchors , who do their best office , if they can but stay you where you be loath to be besides you know prosperity the very bond of love , whose fresh complexion and whose heart together affliction alters .
one of these is true i think affliction may subdue the cheek , but not take in the mind .
yea , say you so ?
there shall not at your father house these seven years be born another such .
my good camillo , she is as forward of her breeding as she is i ' the rear our birth .
i can not say is pity she lacks instructions , for she seems a mistress to most that teach .
your pardon , sir , for this i blush you thanks .
my prettiest perdita !
but o , the thorns we stand upon !
camillo , preserver of my father , now of me , the medicine of our house , how shall we do ?
we are not furnish like bohemia son , nor shall appear in sicilia .
my lord , fear none of this i think you know my fortunes do all lie there it shall be so my care to have you royally appointed as if the scene you play were mine .
for instance , sir , that you may know you shall not want , one word .
they talk aside autolycus ha , ha !
what a fool honesty is !
and trust , his sworn brother , a very simple gentleman !
i have sold all my trumpery , not a counterfeit stone , not a ribbon , glass , pomander , brooch , , ballad , knife , tape , glove , , bracelet , , to keep my pack from fasting they throng who should buy first , as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer by which means i saw whose purse was best in picture , and what i saw , to my good use i remembered .
my clown , who wants but something to be a reasonable man , grew so in love with the wenches ' song , that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words , which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears you might have pinched a placket , it was senseless , was nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse , i could have filed keys off that hung in chains no hearing , no feeling , but my sir song , and admiring the nothing of it .
so that in this time of lethargy i picked and cut most of their festival purses , and had not the old man come in with a against his daughter and the king son and scared my choughs from the chaff , i had not left a purse alive in the whole army .
camillo , florizel , and perdita come forward nay , but my letters , by this means being there so soon as you arrive , shall clear that doubt .
and those that you procure from king leontes shall satisfy your father .
happy be you !
all that you speak shows fair .
who have we here ?
seeing autolycus we make an instrument of this , omit nothing may give us aid .
if they have overheard me now , why , hanging .
how now , good fellow !
why shakest thou so ?
fear not , man , here no harm intended to thee .
i am a poor fellow , sir .
why , be so still , here nobody will steal that from thee yet for the outside of thy poverty we must make an exchange , therefore discase thee instantly , thou must think there a necessity i , and change garments with this gentleman though the pennyworth on his side be the worst , yet hold thee , there some boot .
i am a poor fellow , sir .
aside i know ye well enough .
nay , prithee , dispatch the gentleman is half flayed already .
are you in earnest , sir ?
aside i smell the trick o .
dispatch , i prithee .
indeed , i have had earnest but i can not with conscience take it .
unbuckle , unbuckle .
florizel and autolycus exchange garments fortunate mistress , let my prophecy come home to ye ! you must retire yourself into some covert take your sweetheart hat and pluck it your brows , muffle your face , dismantle you , and , as you can , disliken the truth of your own seeming , that you may for i do fear eyes over to shipboard get undescried .
i see the play so lies that i must bear a part .
no remedy .
have you done there ?
should i now meet my father , he would not call me son .
nay , you shall have no hat .
giving it to perdita come , lady , come .
farewell , my friend .
adieu , sir .
o perdita , what have we twain forgot !
pray you , a word .
aside what i do next , shall be to tell the king of this escape and whither they are bound , wherein my hope is i shall so prevail to force him after in whose company i shall review sicilia , for whose sight i have a woman longing .
fortune speed us !
thus we set on , camillo , to the .
the swifter speed the better .
exeunt florizel , perdita , and camillo i understand the business , i hear it to have an open ear , a quick eye , and a nimble hand , is necessary for a , a good nose is requisite also , to smell out work for the other senses .
i see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive .
what an exchange had this been without boot !
what a boot is here with this exchange !
sure the gods do this year connive at us , and we may do any thing extempore .
the prince himself is about a piece of iniquity , stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels if i thought it were a piece of honesty to acquaint the king withal , i would not i hold it the more knavery to conceal it , and therein am i constant to my profession .
clown and shepherd aside , aside , here is more matter for a hot brain every lane end , every shop , church , session , hanging , yields a careful man work .
see , see , what a man you are now !
there is no other way but to tell the king she a changeling and none of your flesh and blood .
nay , but hear me .
nay , but hear me .
go to , then .
she being none of your flesh and blood , your flesh and blood has not offended the king , and so your flesh and blood is not to be punished by him .
show those things you found about her , those secret things , all but what she has with her this being done , let the law go whistle i warrant you .
i will tell the king all , every word , yea , and his son pranks too , who , i may say , is no honest man , neither to his father nor to me , to go about to make me the king .
indeed , was the farthest off you could have been to him and then your blood had been the dearer by i know how much an ounce .
aside very wisely , puppies !
well , let us to the king there is that in this fardel will make him scratch his beard .
aside i know not what impediment this complaint may be to the flight of my master .
pray heartily he be at palace .
aside though i am not naturally honest , i am so sometimes by chance let me pocket up my pedlar excrement .
takes off his false beard how now , rustics !
whither are you bound ?
to the palace , an it like your worship .
your affairs there , what , with whom , the condition of that fardel , the place of your dwelling , your names , your ages , of what having , breeding , and any thing that is fitting to be known , discover .
we are but plain fellows , sir .
a lie , you are rough and hairy .
let me have no lying it becomes none but tradesmen , and they often give us soldiers the lie but we pay them for it with stamped coin , not stabbing steel , therefore they do not give us the lie .
your worship had like to have given us one , if you had not taken yourself with the manner .
are you a courtier , a like you , sir ?
whether it like me or no , i am a courtier .
seest thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings ?
hath not my gait in it the measure of the court ?
receives not thy nose from me ?
reflect i not on thy baseness ?
thinkest thou , for that i insinuate , or toaze from thee thy business , i am therefore no courtier ?
i am courtier , and one that will either push on or pluck back thy business there whereupon i command thee to open thy affair .
my business , sir , is to the king .
what advocate hast thou to him ?
i know not , a like you .
advocate the for a pheasant say you have none .
none , sir , i have no pheasant , cock nor hen .
how blessed are we that are not simple men !
yet nature might have made me as these are , therefore i will not disdain .
this can not be but a great courtier .
his garments are rich , but he wears them not handsomely .
he seems to be the more noble in being fantastical a great man , i warrant , i know by the picking on teeth .
the fardel there ?
what i ' the fardel ?
wherefore that box ?
sir , there lies such secrets in this fardel and box , which none must know but the king , and which he shall know within this hour , if i may come to the speech of him .
age , thou hast lost thy labour .
why , sir ?
the king is not at the palace , he is gone aboard a new ship to purge melancholy and air himself for , if thou beest capable of things serious , thou must know the king is full of grief .
so is said , sir , about his son , that should have married a shepherd daughter .
if that shepherd be not in , let him fly the curses he shall have , the tortures he shall feel , will break the back of man , the heart of monster .
think you so , sir ?
not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy and vengeance bitter , but those that are germane to him , though removed fifty times , shall all come under the hangman which though it be great pity , yet it is necessary .
an old rogue a , to offer to have his daughter come into grace !
some say he shall be stoned , but that death is too soft for him , say i draw our throne into a !
all deaths are too few , the sharpest too easy .
has the old man a son , sir , do you hear .
a like you , sir ?
he has a son , who shall be flayed alive , then over with honey , set on the head of a wasp nest , then stand till he be three quarters and a dram dead , then recovered again with or some other hot infusion , then , raw as he is , and in the hottest day prognostication proclaims , shall be be set against a , the sun looking with a southward eye upon him , where he is to behold him with flies blown to death .
but what talk we of these traitorly rascals , whose miseries are to be smiled at , their offences being so capital ?
tell me , for you seem to be honest plain men , what you have to the king being something gently considered , i bring you where he is aboard , tender your persons to his presence , whisper him in your behalfs , and if it be in man besides the king to effect your suits , here is man shall do it .
he seems to be of great authority close with him , give him gold , and though authority be a stubborn bear , yet he is oft led by the nose with gold show the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand , and no more ado .
remember , ' and alive . '
a please you , sir , to undertake the business for us , here is that gold i have i make it as much more and leave this young man in pawn till i bring it you .
after i have done what i promised ?
ay , sir .
well , give me the moiety .
are you a party in this business ?
in some sort , sir but though my case be a pitiful one , i hope i shall not be flayed out of it .
o , that the case of the shepherd son hang him , he be made an example .
comfort , good comfort !
we must to the king and show our strange sights he must know is none of your daughter nor my sister , we are gone else .
sir , i will give you as much as this old man does when the business is performed , and remain , as he says , your pawn till it be brought you .
i will trust you .
walk before toward the , go on the right hand i will but look upon the hedge and follow you .
we are blest in this man , as i may say , even blest .
let before as he bids us he was provided to do us good .
exeunt shepherd and clown if i had a mind to be honest , i see fortune would not suffer me she drops booties in my mouth .
i am courted now with a double occasion , gold and a means to do the prince my master good , which who knows how that may turn back to my advancement ?
i will bring these two moles , these blind ones , aboard him if he think it fit to shore them again and that the complaint they have to the king concerns him nothing , let him call me rogue for being so far officious , for i am proof against that title and what shame else belongs .
to him will i present them there may be matter in it .
exit act v scene i .
a room in leontes ' palace .
enter leontes , cleomenes , dion , paulina , and servants sir , you have done enough , and have perform a sorrow no fault could you make , which you have not redeem , indeed , paid down more penitence than done trespass at the last , do as the heavens have done , forget your evil , with them forgive yourself .
whilst i remember her and her virtues , i can not forget my blemishes in them , and so still think of the wrong i did myself , which was so much , that heirless it hath made my kingdom and destroy the companion that man bred his hopes out of .
true , too true , my lord if , one by one , you wedded all the world , or from the all that are took something good , to make a perfect woman , she you kill would be unparallel .
i think so .
kill !
she i kill !
i did so but thou strikest me sorely , to say i did , it is as bitter upon thy tongue as in my thought now , good now , say so but seldom .
not at all , good lady you might have spoken a thousand things that would have done the time more benefit and graced your kindness better .
you are one of those would have him wed again .
if you would not so , you pity not the state , nor the remembrance of his most sovereign name , consider little what dangers , by his highness ' fail of issue , may drop upon his kingdom and devour incertain lookers on .
what were more holy than to rejoice the former queen is well ?
what holier than , for royalty repair , for present comfort and for future good , to bless the bed of majesty again with a sweet fellow ?
there is none worthy , respecting her that gone .
besides , the gods will have fulfill their secret purposes , for has not the divine apollo said , not the tenor of his oracle , that king leontes shall not have an heir till his lost child be found ?
which that it shall , is all as monstrous to our human reason as my antigonus to break his grave and come again to me , who , on my life , did perish with the infant .
is your counsel my lord should to the heavens be contrary , oppose against their wills .
to leontes care not for issue , the crown will find an heir great alexander left his to the worthiest , so his successor was like to be the best .
good paulina , who hast the memory of hermione , i know , in honour , o , that ever i had squared me to thy counsel !
then , even now , i might have look upon my queen full eyes , have taken treasure from her lips and left them more rich for what they yielded .
thou truth .
no more such wives , therefore , no wife one worse , and better used , would make her sainted spirit again possess her corpse , and on this stage , where we offenders now , appear , and begin , to me ? '
had she such power , she had just cause .
she had , and would incense me to murder her i married .
i should so .
were i the ghost that walk , bid you mark her eye , and tell me for what dull part i you chose her , then shriek , that even your ears should rift to hear me , and the words that follow should be mine . '
stars , stars , and all eyes else dead coals !
fear thou no wife , i have no wife , paulina .
will you swear never to marry but by my free leave ?
never , paulina , so be blest my spirit !
then , good my lords , bear witness to his oath .
you tempt him .
unless another , as like hermione as is her picture , affront his eye .
good madam , i have done .
yet , if my lord will marry , if you will , sir , no remedy , but you will , give me the office to choose you a queen she shall not be so young as was your former , but she shall be such as , walk your first queen ghost , it should take joy to see her in your arms .
my true paulina , we shall not marry till thou us .
that shall be when your first queen again in breath , never till then .
enter a gentleman one that gives out himself prince florizel , son of polixenes , with his princess , she the fairest i have yet beheld , desires access to your high presence .
what with him ?
he comes not like to his father greatness his approach , so out of circumstance and sudden , tells us is not a visitation framed , but forced by need and accident .
what train ?
but few , and those but mean .
his princess , say you , with him ?
ay , the most peerless piece of earth , i think , that the sun shone bright on .
o hermione , as every present time doth boast itself above a better gone , so must thy grave give way to what seen now !
sir , you yourself have said and writ so , but your writing now is colder than that theme , had not been , nor was not to be equall , ' thus your verse flow with her beauty once is shrewdly ebb , to say you have seen a better .
pardon , madam the one i have almost forgot , your pardon , the other , when she has obtain your eye , will have your tongue too .
this is a creature , would she begin a sect , might quench the zeal of all professors else , make proselytes of who she but bid follow .
how !
not women ?
women will love her , that she is a woman more worth than any man , men , that she is the rarest of all women .
go , cleomenes , yourself , assisted with your honour friends , bring them to our embracement .
still , is strange exeunt cleomenes and others he thus should steal upon us .
had our prince , jewel of children , seen this hour , he had pair well with this lord there was not full a month between their births .
prithee , no more , cease , thou he dies to me again when talk of sure , when i shall see this gentleman , thy speeches will bring me to consider that which may unfurnish me of reason .
they are come .
cleomenes and others , with florizel and perdita your mother was most true to wedlock , prince , for she did print your royal father off , conceiving you were i but , your father image is so hit in you , his very air , that i should call you brother , as i did him , and speak of something wildly by us perform before .
most dearly welcome !
and your fair princess , goddess ! o , alas !
i lost a couple , that heaven and earth might thus have stood begetting wonder as you , gracious couple , do and then i lost all mine own folly the society , amity too , of your brave father , whom , though bearing misery , i desire my life once more to look on him .
by his command have i here touch sicilia and from him give you all greetings that a king , at friend , can send his brother and , but infirmity which waits upon worn times hath something seized his wish ability , he had himself the lands and waters your throne and his measured to look upon you , whom he loves he bade me say so more than all the sceptres and those that bear them living .
o my brother , good gentleman !
the wrongs i have done thee stir afresh within me , and these thy offices , so rarely kind , are as interpreters of my slackness .
welcome hither , as is the spring to the earth .
and hath he too exposed this paragon to the fearful usage , at least ungentle , of the dreadful neptune , to greet a man not worth her pains , much less the adventure of her person ?
good my lord , she came from libya .
where the warlike smalus , that noble honour lord , is fear and loved ?
most royal sir , from thence , from him , whose daughter his tears proclaim his , parting with her thence , a prosperous friendly , we have cross , to execute the charge my father gave me for visiting your highness my best train i have from your sicilian shores dismiss , who for bohemia bend , to signify not only my success in libya , sir , but my arrival and my wife in safety here where we are .
the blessed gods purge all infection from our air whilst you do climate here !
you have a holy father , a graceful gentleman , against whose person , so sacred as it is , i have done sin for which the heavens , taking angry note , have left me issueless , and your father blest , as he from heaven merits it , with you worthy his goodness .
what might i have been , might i a son and daughter now have look on , such goodly things as you !
enter a lord most noble sir , that which i shall report will bear no credit , were not the proof so nigh .
please you , great sir , bohemia greets you from himself by me , desires you to attach his son , who has his dignity and duty both cast off fled from his father , from his hopes , and with a shepherd daughter .
where bohemia ?
speak .
here in your city , i now came from him i speak amazedly , and it becomes my marvel and my message .
to your court whiles he was hastening , in the chase , it seems , of this fair couple , meets he on the way the father of this seeming lady and her brother , having both their country quitted with this young prince .
camillo has betray me , whose honour and whose honesty till now endured all weathers .
so to his charge he with the king your father .
who ?
camillo ?
camillo , sir , i spake with him , who now has these poor men in question .
never saw i wretches so quake they kneel , they kiss the earth , forswear themselves as often as they speak bohemia stops his ears , and threatens them with divers deaths in death .
o my poor father !
the heaven sets spies upon us , will not have our contract celebrated .
you are married ?
we are not , sir , nor are we like to be , the stars , i see , will kiss the valleys first the odds for high and low alike .
my lord , is this the daughter of a king ?
she is , when once she is my wife .
that ' i see by your good father speed will come on very slowly .
i am sorry , most sorry , you have broken from his liking where you were tied in duty , and as sorry your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty , that you might well enjoy her .
dear , look up though fortune , visible an enemy , should chase us with my father , power no jot hath she to change our loves .
beseech you , sir , remember since you owed no more to time than i do now with thought of such affections , step forth mine advocate , at your request my father will grant precious things as trifles .
would he do so , beg your precious mistress , which he counts but a trifle .
sir , my liege , your eye hath too much youth i not a month your queen died , she was more worth such gazes than what you look on now .
i thought of her , even in these looks i made .
to florizel but your petition is yet unanswer .
i will to your father your honour not by your desires , i am friend to them and you upon which errand i now go toward him , therefore follow me and mark what way i make come , good my lord .
exeunt scene ii .
before leontes ' palace .
enter autolycus and a gentleman beseech you , sir , were you present at this relation ?
i was by at the opening of the fardel , heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it whereupon , after a little amazedness , we were all commanded out of the chamber , only this methought i heard the shepherd say , he found the child .
i would most gladly know the issue of it .
i make a broken delivery of the business , but the changes i perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration they seemed almost , with staring on one another , to tear the cases of their eyes , there was speech in their dumbness , language in their very gesture , they looked as they had heard of a world ransomed , or one destroyed a notable passion of wonder appeared in them , but the wisest beholder , that knew no more but seeing , could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow , but in the extremity of the one , it must needs be .
enter another gentleman here comes a gentleman that haply knows more .
the news , rogero ?
nothing but bonfires the oracle is fulfilled , the king daughter is found such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that can not be able to express it .
enter a third gentleman here comes the lady paulina steward he can deliver you more .
how goes it now , sir ?
this news which is called true is so like an old tale , that the verity of it is in strong suspicion has the king found his heir ?
most true , if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance that which you hear you swear you see , there is such unity in the proofs .
the mantle of queen hermione , her jewel about the neck of it , the letters of antigonus found with it which they know to be his character , the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother , the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding , and many other evidences proclaim her with all certainty to be the king daughter .
did you see the meeting of the two kings ?
no .
then have you lost a sight , which was to be seen , can not be spoken of .
there might you have beheld one joy crown another , so and in such manner that it seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them , for their joy waded in tears .
there was casting up of eyes , holding up of hands , with countenances of such distraction that they were to be known by garment , not by favour .
our king , being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter , as if that joy were now become a loss , cries ' o , thy mother , thy mother ! '
then asks bohemia forgiveness , then embraces his , then again worries he his daughter with clipping her , now he thanks the old shepherd , which stands by like a conduit of many kings ' reigns .
i never heard of such another encounter , which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it .
what , pray you , became of antigonus , that carried hence the child ?
like an old tale still , which will have matter to rehearse , though credit be asleep and not an ear open .
he was torn to pieces with a bear this avouches the shepherd son , who has not only his innocence , which seems much , to justify him , but a handkerchief and rings of his that paulina knows .
what became of his bark and his followers ?
wrecked the same instant of their master death and in the view of the shepherd so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found .
but o , the noble combat that joy and sorrow was fought in paulina !
she had one eye declined for the loss of her husband , another elevated that the oracle was fulfilled she lifted the princess from the earth , and so locks her in embracing , as if she would pin her to her heart that she might no more be in danger of losing .
the dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes , for by such was it acted .
one of the prettiest touches of all and that which angled for mine eyes , caught the water though not the fish , was when , at the relation of the queen death , with the manner how she came bravely confessed and lamented by the king , how attentiveness wounded his daughter , till , from one sign of dolour to another , she did , with an , ' i would fain say , bleed tears , for i am sure my heart wept blood .
who was most marble there changed colour , some swooned , all sorrowed if all the world could have seen , the woe had been universal .
are they returned to the court ?
no the princess hearing of her mother statue , which is in the keeping of paulina , a piece many years in doing and now newly performed by that rare italian master , julio romano , who , had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work , would beguile nature of her custom , so perfectly he is her ape he so near to hermione hath done hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer thither with all greediness of affection are they gone , and there they intend to sup .
i thought she had some great matter there in hand , for she hath privately twice or thrice a day , ever since the death of hermione , visited that removed house .
shall we thither and with our company piece the rejoicing ?
who would be thence that has the benefit of access ?
every wink of an eye some new grace will be born our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge .
let along .
exeunt gentlemen now , had i not the dash of my former life in me , would preferment drop on my head .
i brought the old man and his son aboard the prince told him i heard them talk of a fardel and i know not what but he at that time , overfond of the shepherd daughter , so he then took her to be , who began to be much , and himself little better , extremity of weather continuing , this mystery remained undiscovered .
but is all one to me , for had i been the finder out of this secret , it would not have relished among my other discredits .
enter shepherd and clown here come those i have done good to against my will , and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune .
come , boy , i am past moe children , but thy sons and daughters will be all gentlemen born .
you are well met , sir .
you denied to fight with me this other day , because i was no gentleman born .
see you these clothes ?
say you see them not and think me still no gentleman born you were best say these robes are not gentlemen born give me the lie , do , and try whether i am not now a gentleman born .
i know you are now , sir , a gentleman born .
ay , and have been so any time these four hours .
and so have i , boy .
so you have but i was a gentleman born before my father , for the king son took me by the hand , and called me brother , and then the two kings called my father brother , and then the prince my brother and the princess my sister called my father father , and so we wept , and there was the first tears that ever we shed .
we may live , son , to shed many more .
ay , or else hard luck , being in so preposterous estate as we are .
i humbly beseech you , sir , to pardon me all the faults i have committed to your worship and to give me your good report to the prince my master .
prithee , son , do , for we must be gentle , now we are gentlemen .
thou wilt amend thy life ?
ay , an it like your good worship .
give me thy hand i will swear to the prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in bohemia .
you may say it , but not swear it .
not swear it , now i am a gentleman ?
let boors and franklins say it , i swear it .
how if it be false , son ?
if it be so false , a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend and i swear to the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk , but i know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk but i swear it , and i would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands .
i will prove so , sir , to my power .
ay , by any means prove a tall fellow if i do not wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk , not being a tall fellow , trust me not .
hark !
the kings and the princes , our kindred , are going to see the queen picture .
come , follow us we be thy good masters .
exeunt scene iii .
a chapel in paulina house .
enter leontes , polixenes , florizel , perdita , camillo , paulina , lords , and attendants o grave and good paulina , the great comfort that i have had of thee !
what , sovereign sir , i did not well i meant well .
all my services you have paid home but that you have vouchsafed , with your crown brother and these your contracted heirs of your kingdoms , my poor house to visit , it is a surplus of your grace , which never my life may last to answer .
o paulina , we honour you with trouble but we came to see the statue of our queen your gallery have we pass through , not without much content in many singularities , but we saw not that which my daughter came to look upon , the statue of her mother .
as she lived peerless , so her dead likeness , i do well believe , excels whatever yet you look upon or hand of man hath done , therefore i keep it lonely , apart .
but here it is prepare to see the life as lively mock as ever still sleep mock death behold , and say is well .
paulina draws a curtain , and discovers hermione standing like a statue i like your silence , it the more shows off your wonder but yet speak , first , you , my liege , comes it not something near ?
her natural posture !
chide me , dear stone , that i may say indeed thou art hermione , or rather , thou art she in thy not chiding , for she was as tender as infancy and grace .
but yet , paulina , hermione was not so much wrinkled , nothing so aged as this seems .
o , not by much .
so much the more our carver excellence , which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her as she lived now .
as now she might have done , so much to my good comfort , as it is now piercing to my soul .
o , thus she stood , even with such life of majesty , warm life , as now it coldly stands , when first i woo her !
i am ashamed does not the stone rebuke me for being more stone than it ?
o royal piece , there magic in thy majesty , which has my evils conjured to remembrance and from thy admiring daughter took the spirits , standing like stone with thee .
and give me leave , and do not say is superstition , that i kneel and then implore her blessing .
lady , dear queen , that ended when i but began , give me that hand of yours to kiss .
o , patience !
the statue is but newly fix , the colour not dry .
my lord , your sorrow was too sore laid on , which sixteen winters can not blow away , so many summers dry , scarce any joy did ever so long live , no sorrow but kill itself much sooner .
dear my brother , let him that was the cause of this have power to take off so much grief from you as he will piece up in himself .
indeed , my lord , if i had thought the sight of my poor image would thus have wrought you , for the stone is mine not have show it .
do not draw the curtain .
no longer shall you gaze o , lest your fancy may think anon it moves .
let be , let be .
would i were dead , but that , methinks , already what was he that did make it ?
see , my lord , would you not deem it breathed ?
and that those veins did verily bear blood ?
masterly done the very life seems warm upon her lip .
the fixture of her eye has motion i , as we are mock with art .
i draw the curtain my lord almost so far transported that he think anon it lives .
o sweet paulina , make me to think so twenty years together !
no settled senses of the world can match the pleasure of that madness .
let alone .
i am sorry , sir , i have thus far stirr you but i could afflict you farther .
do , paulina , for this affliction has a taste as sweet as any cordial comfort .
still , methinks , there is an air comes from her what fine chisel could ever yet cut breath ?
let no man mock me , for i will kiss her .
good my lord , forbear the ruddiness upon her lip is wet , you mar it if you kiss it , stain your own with oily painting .
shall i draw the curtain ?
no , not these twenty years .
so long could i stand by , a looker on .
either forbear , quit presently the chapel , or resolve you for more amazement .
if you can behold it , i make the statue move indeed , descend and take you by the hand , but then you think which i protest against i am assisted by wicked powers .
what you can make her do , i am content to look on what to speak , i am content to hear , for is as easy to make her speak as move .
it is required you do awake your faith .
then all stand still , on those that think it is unlawful business i am about , let them depart .
proceed no foot shall stir .
music , awake her , strike !
music is time , descend , be stone no more , approach , strike all that look upon with marvel .
come , i fill your grave up stir , nay , come away , bequeath to death your numbness , for from him dear life redeems you .
you perceive she stirs hermione comes down start not , her actions shall be holy as you hear my spell is lawful do not shun her until you see her die again , for then you kill her double .
nay , present your hand when she was young you woo her , now in age is she become the suitor ?
o , she warm !
if this be magic , let it be an art lawful as eating .
she embraces him .
she hangs about his neck if she pertain to life let her speak too .
ay , and manifest where she has lived , or how stolen from the dead .
that she is living , were it but told you , should be hooted at like an old tale but it appears she lives , though yet she speak not .
mark a little while .
please you to interpose , fair madam kneel and pray your mother blessing .
turn , good lady , our perdita is found .
you gods , look down and from your sacred vials pour your graces upon my daughter head !
tell me , mine own .
where hast thou been preserved ?
where lived ?
how found thy father court ?
for thou shalt hear that i , knowing by paulina that the oracle gave hope thou wast in being , have preserved myself to see the issue .
there time enough for that , lest they desire upon this push to trouble your joys with like relation .
go together , you precious winners all , your exultation partake to every one .
i , an old turtle , will wing me to some wither bough and there my mate , that never to be found again , lament till i am lost .
o , peace , paulina !
thou shouldst a husband take by my consent , as i by thine a wife this is a match , and made between by vows .
thou hast found mine , but how , is to be question , for i saw her , as i thought , dead , and have in vain said many a prayer upon her grave .
i not seek far for him , i partly know his mind to find thee an honourable husband .
come , camillo , and take her by the hand , whose worth and honesty is richly noted and here justified by us , a pair of kings .
let from this place .
what !
look upon my brother both your pardons , that i put between your holy looks my ill suspicion .
this is your , and son unto the king , who , heavens directing , is to your daughter .
good paulina , lead us from hence , where we may leisurely each one demand an answer to his part perform in this wide gap of time since first we were dissever hastily lead away .
