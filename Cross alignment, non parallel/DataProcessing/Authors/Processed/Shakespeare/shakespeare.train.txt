act i scene london .
the palace .
enter king henry , lord john of lancaster , the earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and others so shaken as we are , so wan with care , find we a time for frighted peace to pant , and breathe accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote .
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children blood , nor more shall trenching war channel her fields , nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes , which , like the meteors of a troubled heaven , all of one nature , of one substance bred , did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now , in mutual ranks , march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance , kindred and allies the edge of war , like an knife , no more shall cut his master .
therefore , friends , as far as to the sepulchre of christ , whose soldier now , under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight , forthwith a power of english shall we levy , whose arms were moulded in their mothers ' womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walk those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nail for our advantage on the bitter cross .
but this our purpose now is twelve month old , and bootless is to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now .
then let me hear of you , my gentle cousin westmoreland , what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience .
my liege , this haste was hot in question , and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news , whose worst was , that the noble mortimer , leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower , was by the rude hands of that welshman taken , a thousand of his people butchered , upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse , such beastly shameless transformation , by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of .
it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land .
this match with other did , my gracious lord , for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on day , the gallant hotspur there , young harry percy and brave archibald , that and approved scot , at holmedon met , where they did spend a sad and bloody hour , as by discharge of their artillery , and shape of likelihood , the news was told , for he that brought them , in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse , uncertain of the issue any way .
here is a dear , a true industrious friend , sir walter blunt , new lighted from his horse .
stain with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours , and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news .
the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots , two and twenty knights , balk in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon plains .
of prisoners , hotspur took mordake the earl of fife , and eldest son to beaten douglas , and the earl of athol , of murray , angus , and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil ?
a gallant prize ?
ha , cousin , is it not ?
in faith , it is a conquest for a prince to boast of .
yea , there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son , a son who is the theme of honour tongue , amongst a grove , the very straightest plant , who is sweet fortune minion and her pride whilst i , by looking on the praise of him , see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry .
o that it could be proved that some fairy had exchanged in our children where they lay , and call mine percy , his plantagenet !
then would i have his harry , and he mine .
but let him from my thoughts .
what think you , coz , of this young percy pride ?
the prisoners , which he in this adventure hath surprised , to his own use he keeps , and sends me word , i shall have none but mordake earl of fife .
this is his uncle teaching , this is worcester , malevolent to you in all aspects , which makes him prune himself , and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity .
but i have sent for him to answer this , and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem .
cousin , on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor , so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again , for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered .
i will , my liege .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
an apartment of the prince .
enter the prince of wales and falstaff now , hal , what time of day is it , lad ?
thou art so , with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon , that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know .
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day ?
unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in taffeta , i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day .
indeed , you come near me now , hal , for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars , and not by phoebus , he , wandering knight so fair . '
and , i prithee , sweet wag , when thou art king , as , god save thy grace , majesty i should say , for grace thou wilt have none , what , none ?
no , by my troth , not so much as will serve to prologue to an egg and butter .
well , how then ?
come , roundly , roundly .
marry , then , sweet wag , when thou art king , let not us that are squires of the night body be called thieves of the day beauty let us be diana foresters , gentlemen of the shade , minions of the moon , and let men say we be men of good government , being governed , as the sea is , by our noble and chaste mistress the moon , under whose countenance we steal .
thou sayest well , and it holds well too , for the fortune of us that are the moon men doth ebb and flow like the sea , being governed , as the sea is , by the moon .
as , for proof , now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning , got with swearing by ' and spent with crying in , ' now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows .
by the lord , thou sayest true , lad .
and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench ?
as the honey of hybla , my old lad of the castle .
and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance ?
how now , how now , mad wag !
what , in thy quips and thy quiddities ?
what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin ?
why , what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern ?
well , thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft .
did i ever call for thee to pay thy part ?
no , i give thee thy due , thou hast paid all there .
yea , and elsewhere , so far as my coin would stretch , and where it would not , i have used my credit .
yea , and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent but , i prithee , sweet wag , shall there be gallows standing in england when thou art king ?
and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law ?
do not thou , when thou art king , hang a thief .
no , thou shalt .
shall i ?
o rare !
by the lord , i be a brave judge .
thou judgest false already i mean , thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman .
well , hal , well , and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court , i can tell you .
for obtaining of suits ?
yea , for obtaining of suits , whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe .
, i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear .
or an old lion , or a lover lute .
yea , or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe .
what sayest thou to a hare , or the melancholy of ?
thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative , rascalliest , sweet young prince .
but , hal , i prithee , trouble me no more with vanity .
i would to god thou and i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought .
an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you , sir , but i marked him not , and yet he talked very wisely , but i regarded him not , and yet he talked wisely , and in the street too .
thou didst well , for wisdom cries out in the streets , and no man regards it .
o , thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint .
thou hast done much harm upon me , hal , god forgive thee for it !
before i knew thee , hal , i knew nothing , and now am i , if a man should speak truly , little better than one of the wicked .
i must give over this life , and i will give it over by the lord , and i do not , i am a villain i be damned for never a king son in christendom .
where shall we take a purse tomorrow , jack ?
, where thou wilt , lad , i make one , an i do not , call me villain and baffle me .
i see a good amendment of life in thee , from praying to .
why , hal , is my vocation , hal , is no sin for a man to labour in his vocation .
enter poins poins !
now shall we know if gadshill have set a match .
o , if men were to be saved by merit , what hole in hell were hot enough for him ?
this is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried ' to a true man .
good morrow , ned .
good morrow , sweet hal .
what says monsieur remorse ?
what says sir john sack and sugar ?
jack !
how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul , that thou soldest him on last for a cup of madeira and a cold capon leg ?
sir john stands to his word , the devil shall have his bargain , for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs he will give the devil his due .
then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil .
else he had been damned for cozening the devil .
but , my lads , my lads , morning , by four , early at gadshill !
there are pilgrims going to canterbury with rich offerings , and traders riding to london with fat purses i have vizards for you all , you have horses for yourselves gadshill lies in rochester i have bespoke supper night in eastcheap we may do it as secure as sleep .
if you will go , i will stuff your purses full of crowns , if you will not , tarry at home and be hanged .
hear ye , yedward , if i tarry at home and go not , i hang you for going .
you will , chops ?
hal , wilt thou make one ?
who , i rob ?
i a thief ?
not i , by my faith .
there neither honesty , manhood , nor good fellowship in thee , nor thou camest not of the blood royal , if thou darest not stand for ten shillings .
well then , once in my days i be a madcap .
why , that well said .
well , come what will , i tarry at home .
by the lord , i be a traitor then , when thou art king .
i care not .
sir john , i prithee , leave the prince and me alone i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go .
well , god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting , that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed , that the true prince may , for recreation sake , prove a false thief , for the poor abuses of the time want countenance .
farewell you shall find me in eastcheap .
farewell , thou latter spring !
farewell , summer !
exit falstaff now , my good sweet honey lord , ride with us i have a jest to execute that i can not manage alone .
falstaff , bardolph , peto and gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and i will not be there , and when they have the booty , if you and i do not rob them , cut this head off from my shoulders .
how shall we part with them in setting forth ?
why , we will set forth before or after them , and appoint them a place of meeting , wherein it is at our pleasure to fail , and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves , which they shall have no sooner achieved , but we set upon them .
yea , but is like that they will know us by our horses , by our habits and by every other appointment , to be ourselves .
tut !
our horses they shall not see i tie them in the wood , our vizards we will change after we leave them and , sirrah , i have cases of buckram for the nonce , to immask our noted outward garments .
yea , but i doubt they will be too hard for us .
well , for two of them , i know them to be as cowards as ever turned back , and for the third , if he fight longer than he sees reason , i forswear arms .
the virtue of this jest will be , the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty , at least , he fought with , what wards , what blows , what extremities he endured , and in the reproof of this lies the jest .
well , i go with thee provide us all things necessary and meet me night in eastcheap , there i sup .
farewell .
farewell , my lord .
exit poins i know you all , and will awhile uphold the unyoked humour of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun , who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world , that , when he please again to be himself , being wanted , he may be more wonder at , by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him .
if all the year were playing holidays , to sport would be as tedious as to work , but when they seldom come , they wish for come , and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents .
so , when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised , by how much better than my word i am , by so much shall i falsify men hopes , and like bright metal on a sullen ground , my reformation , glittering my fault , shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off .
i so offend , to make offence a skill , redeeming time when men think least i will .
exit scene iii .
london .
the palace .
enter the king , northumberland , worcester , hotspur , sir walter blunt , with others my blood hath been too cold and temperate , unapt to stir at these indignities , and you have found me , for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself , mighty and to be fear , than my condition , which hath been smooth as oil , soft as young down , and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul pays but to the proud .
our house , my sovereign liege , little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it , and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly .
my worcester , get thee gone , for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o , sir , your presence is too bold and peremptory , and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow .
you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel , we shall send for you .
exit worcester you were about to speak .
to north yea , my good lord .
those prisoners in your highness ' name demanded , which harry percy here at holmedon took , were , as he says , not with such strength denied as is deliver to your majesty either envy , therefore , or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son .
my liege , i did deny no prisoners .
but i remember , when the fight was done , when i was dry with rage and extreme toil , breathless and faint , leaning upon my sword , came there a certain lord , neat , and trimly dress , fresh as a bridegroom , and his chin new reap show like a at , he was perfumed like a milliner , and his finger and his thumb he held a , which ever and anon he gave his nose and away again , who therewith angry , when it next came there , took it in snuff , and still he smiled and talk , and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by , he call them untaught knaves , unmannerly , to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility .
with many holiday and lady terms he question me , amongst the rest , demanded my prisoners in your majesty behalf .
i then , all smarting with my wounds being cold , to be so pester with a popinjay , out of my grief and my impatience , answer neglectingly i know not what , he should or he should not , for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a of guns and drums and wounds , god save the mark ! and telling me the thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise , and that it was great pity , so it was , this villanous should be digg out of the bowels of the harmless earth , which many a good tall fellow had destroy so cowardly , and but for these vile guns , he would himself have been a soldier .
this bald unjointed chat of his , my lord , i answer indirectly , as i said , and i beseech you , let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty .
the circumstance consider , good my lord , lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place , at such a time , with all the rest retold , may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said , so he unsay it now .
why , yet he doth deny his prisoners , but with proviso and exception , that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his , the foolish mortimer , who , on my soul , hath wilfully betray the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician , damn glendower , whose daughter , as we hear , the earl of march hath lately married .
shall our coffers , then , be emptied to redeem a traitor home ?
shall we but treason ?
and indent with fears , when they have lost and forfeited themselves ?
no , on the barren mountains let him starve , for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer .
revolted mortimer !
he never did fall off , my sovereign liege , but by the chance of war , to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds , those mouthed wounds , which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn sedgy bank , in single opposition , hand to hand , he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink , upon agreement , of swift severn flood , who then , affrighted with their bloody looks , ran fearfully among the trembling reeds , and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank , bloodstained with these valiant combatants .
never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds , nor could the noble mortimer receive so many , and all willingly then let not him be slander with revolt .
thou dost belie him , percy , thou dost belie him , he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee , he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy .
art thou not ashamed ?
but , sirrah , henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means , or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you .
my lord northumberland , we licence your departure with your son .
send us your prisoners , or you will hear of it .
exeunt king henry , blunt , and train an if the devil come and roar for them , i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so , for i will ease my heart , albeit i make a hazard of my head .
what , drunk with choler ?
stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle .
worcester speak of mortimer !
, i will speak of him , and let my soul want mercy , if i do not join with him yea , on his part i empty all these veins , and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust , but i will lift the mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king , as this ingrate and canker bolingbroke .
brother , the king hath made your nephew mad .
who struck this heat up after i was gone ?
he will , forsooth , have all my prisoners , and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife brother , then his cheek look pale , and on my face he turn an eye of death , trembling even at the name of mortimer .
i can not blame him was not he proclaim by richard that dead is the next of blood ?
he was , i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king , whose wrongs in us god pardon ! did set forth upon his irish expedition , from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered .
and for whose death we in the world wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of .
but soft , i pray you , did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown ?
he did , myself did hear it .
nay , then i can not blame his cousin king , that wished him on the barren mountains starve .
but shall it be that you , that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation , shall it be , that you a world of curses undergo , being the agents , or base second means , the cords , the ladder , or the hangman rather ?
o , pardon me that i descend so low , to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king , shall it for shame be spoken in these days , or fill up chronicles in time to come , that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf , as both of you god pardon it ! have done , to put down richard , that sweet lovely rose , an plant this thorn , this canker , bolingbroke ?
and shall it in more shame be further spoken , that you are fool , discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent ?
no , yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again , revenge the jeering and disdain contempt of this proud king , who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore , i say peace , cousin , say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book , and to your discontents i read you matter deep and dangerous , as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear .
if he fall in , good night !
or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west , so honour cross it from the north to south , and let them grapple o , the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare !
imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience .
by heaven , methinks it were an easy leap , to pluck bright honour from the moon , or dive into the bottom of the deep , where could never touch the ground , and pluck up drowned honour by the locks , so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival , all her dignities but out upon this fellowship !
he apprehends a world of figures here , but not the form of what he should attend .
good cousin , give me audience for a while .
i cry you mercy .
those same noble scots that are your prisoners , i keep them all , by god , he shall not have a scot of them , no , if a scot would save his soul , he shall not i keep them , by this hand .
you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes .
those prisoners you shall keep .
nay , i will , that flat he said he would not ransom mortimer , forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer , but i will find him when he lies asleep , and in his ear i holla ! '
nay , i have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but , ' and give it him to keep his anger still in motion .
hear you , cousin , a word .
all studies here i solemnly defy , save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same prince of wales , but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance , i would have him poison with a pot of ale .
farewell , kinsman i talk to you when you are better temper to attend .
why , what a and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman mood , tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own !
why , look you , i am whipp and scourged with rods , nettled and stung with pismires , when i hear of this vile politician , bolingbroke .
in richard time , what do you call the place ? a plague upon it , it is in gloucestershire , was where the madcap duke his uncle kept , his uncle york , where i first bow my knee unto this king of smiles , this bolingbroke , ! when you and he came back from ravenspurgh .
at berkley castle .
you say true why , what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me !
look , his infant fortune came to age , ' and harry percy , ' and cousin , ' o , the devil take such cozeners !
god forgive me !
good uncle , tell your tale , i have done .
nay , if you have not , to it again , we will stay your leisure .
i have done , i ' faith .
then once more to your scottish prisoners .
deliver them up without their ransom straight , and make the douglas ' son your only mean for powers in scotland , which , for divers reasons which i shall send you written , be assured , will easily be granted .
you , my lord , to northumberland your son in scotland being thus employ , shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate , well beloved , the archbishop .
of york , is it not ?
true , who bears hard his brother death at bristol , the lord scroop .
i speak not this in estimation , as what i think might be , but what i know is ruminated , plotted and set down , and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on .
i smell it upon my life , it will do well .
before the game is afoot , thou still slip .
why , it can not choose but be a noble plot , and then the power of scotland and of york , to join with mortimer , ha ?
and so they shall .
in faith , it is exceedingly well aim .
and is no little reason bids us speed , to save our heads by raising of a head , for , bear ourselves as even as we can , the king will always think him in our debt , and think we think ourselves unsatisfied , till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love .
he does , he does we be revenged on him .
cousin , farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course .
when time is ripe , which will be suddenly , i steal to glendower and lord mortimer , where you and douglas and our powers at once , as i will fashion it , shall happily meet , to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms , which now we hold at much uncertainty .
farewell , good brother we shall thrive , i trust .
uncle , adieu o , let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport !

come , neighbour mugs , we call up the gentleman they will along with company , for they have great charge .
exeunt carriers what , ho !
chamberlain !
within at hand , quoth .
that even as fair as at hand , quoth the chamberlain , for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring , thou layest the plot how .
enter chamberlain good morrow , master gadshill .
it holds current that i told you yesternight there a franklin in the wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold i heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper , a kind of auditor , one that hath abundance of charge too , god knows what .
they are up already , and call for eggs and butter , they will away presently .
sirrah , if they meet not with saint nicholas ' clerks , i give thee this neck .
no , i none of it i pray thee keep that for the hangman , for i know thou worshippest nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may .
what talkest thou to me of the hangman ?
if i hang , i make a fat pair of gallows , for if i hang , old sir john hangs with me , and thou knowest he is no starveling .
tut !
there are other trojans that thou dreamest not of , the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace , that would , if matters should be looked into , for their own credit sake , make all whole .
i am joined with no rakers , no sixpenny strikers , none of these mad mustachio , but with nobility and tranquillity , burgomasters and great oneyers , such as can hold in , such as will strike sooner than speak , and speak sooner than drink , and drink sooner than pray and yet , zounds , i lie , for they pray continually to their saint , the commonwealth , or rather , not pray to her , but prey on her , for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots .

she will , she will , justice hath liquored her .

exeunt scene iii .
warkworth castle enter hotspur , solus , reading a letter for mine own part , my lord , i could be well contented to be there , in respect of the love i bear your house . '
he could be contented why is he not , then ?
in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this , he loves his own barn better than he loves our house .
let me see some more .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , ' why , that certain is dangerous to take a cold , to sleep , to drink , but i tell you , my lord fool , out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , the friends you have named uncertain , the time itself unsorted , and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition . '
say you so , say you so ?
i say unto you again , you are a shallow cowardly hind , and you lie .
what a is this !
by the lord , our plot is a good plot as ever was laid , our friends true and constant a good plot , good friends , and full of expectation , an excellent plot , very good friends .
what a rogue is this !
why , my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of action .
, an i were now by this rascal , i could brain him with his lady fan .
is there not my father , my uncle and myself ?
lord edmund mortimer , my lord of york and owen glendower ?
is there not besides the douglas ?

i must leave you within these two hours .
o , my good lord , why are you thus alone ?
for what offence have i this fortnight been a banish woman from my harry bed ?
tell me , sweet lord , what that takes from thee thy stomach , pleasure and thy golden sleep ?
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth , and start so often when thou alone ?
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks , and given my treasures and my rights of thee to musing and cursed melancholy ?
in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch , and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars , speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed , cry !
to the field ! '
and thou hast talk of sallies and retires , of trenches , tents , of palisadoes , frontiers , parapets , of basilisks , of cannon , culverin , of prisoners ' ransom and of soldiers slain , and all the currents of a heady fight .
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war and thus hath so bestirr thee in thy sleep , that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow like bubbles in a stream , and in thy face strange motions have appear , such as we see when men restrain their breath on some great sudden hest .
o , what portents are these ?
some heavy business hath my lord in hand , and i must know it , else he loves me not .
what , ho !
enter servant is gilliams with the packet gone ?

i fear my brother mortimer doth stir about his title , and hath sent for you to line his enterprise but if you go , so far afoot , i shall be weary , love .
come , come , you paraquito , answer me directly unto this question that i ask in faith , i break thy little finger , harry , an if thou wilt not tell me all things true .
away , away , you trifler !
love !
i love thee not , i care not for thee , kate this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips we must have bloody noses and crack crowns , and pass them current too .
god me , my horse !
what thou , kate ?
what thou have with me ?
do you not love me ?
do you not , indeed ?
well , do not then , for since you love me not , i will not love myself .
do you not love me ?
nay , tell me if you speak in jest or no .
come , wilt thou see me ride ?
and when i am on horseback , i will swear i love thee infinitely .
but hark you , kate , i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go , nor reason whereabout whither i must , i must , and , to conclude , this evening must i leave you , gentle kate .
i know you wise , but yet no farther wise than harry percy wife constant you are , but yet a woman and for secrecy , no lady closer , for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know , and so far will i trust thee , gentle kate .
how !
so far ?
not an inch further .
but hark you , kate whither i go , thither shall you go too , will i set forth , you .
will this content you , kate ?
it must of force .

the tavern , eastcheap .
enter prince henry and poins ned , prithee , come out of that fat room , and lend me thy hand to laugh a little .

with three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads .
i have sounded the very of humility .
sirrah , i am sworn brother to a leash of drawers , and can call them all by their christen names , as tom , dick , and francis .
they take it already upon their salvation , that though i be but the prince of wales , yet i am king of courtesy , and tell me flatly i am no proud jack , like falstaff , but a corinthian , a lad of mettle , a good boy , by the lord , so they call me , and when i am king of england , i shall command all the good lads in eastcheap .
they call drinking deep , dyeing scarlet , and when you breathe in your watering , they cry ! '
and bid you play it off .
to conclude , i am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour , that i can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life .
i tell thee , ned , thou hast lost much honour , that thou wert not with me in this sweet action .
but , sweet ned , to sweeten which name of ned , i give thee this pennyworth of sugar , clapped even now into my hand by an , one that never spake other english in his life than shillings and sixpence ' and are welcome , ' with this shrill addition , , anon , sir !

but , ned , to drive away the time till falstaff come , i prithee , do thou stand in some , while i question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar , and do thou never leave calling , ' that his tale to me may be nothing but . '

i am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman adam to the pupil age of this present twelve at midnight .
francis what , francis ?
anon , anon , sir .
exit that ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot , and yet the son of a woman !
his industry is upstairs and downstairs , his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning .
i am not yet of percy mind , the hotspur of the north , he that kills me some six or seven dozen of scots at a breakfast , washes his hands , and says to his wife upon this quiet life !
i want work . '
' o my sweet harry , ' says she , many hast thou killed ? '
my roan horse a drench , ' says he , and answers fourteen , ' an hour after , ' a trifle , a trifle . '

titan , that melted at the sweet tale of the sun !
if thou didst , then behold that compound .
you rogue , here lime in this sack too there is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it .
a villanous coward !
go thy ways , old jack , die when thou wilt , if manhood , good manhood , be not forgot upon the face of the earth , then am i a shotten herring .
there live not three good men unhanged in england , and one of them is fat and grows old god help the while !
a bad world , i say .
i would i were a weaver , i could sing psalms or any thing .
a plague of all cowards , i say still .
how now , !
what mutter you ?
a king son !
if i do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of , i never wear hair on my face more .

answer me to that and poins there ?

i call thee coward !
i see thee damned ere i call thee coward but i would give a thousand pound i could run as fast as thou canst .
you are straight enough in the shoulders , you care not who sees your back call you that backing of your friends ?
a plague upon such backing !
give me them that will face me .
give me a cup of sack i am a rogue , if i drunk .
o villain !
thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last .
all one for that .
he drinks a plague of all cowards , still say i .
what the matter ?
what the matter !
there be four of us here have a thousand pound this day morning .
where is it , jack ?
where is it ?
where is it !
taken from us it is a hundred upon poor four of us .
what , a hundred , man ?
i am a rogue , if i were not at with a dozen of them two hours together .
i have by miracle .
i am eight times thrust through the doublet , four through the hose , my buckler cut through and through , my sword hacked like a ecce signum !
i never dealt better since i was a man all would not do .
a plague of all cowards !
let them speak if they speak more or less than truth , they are villains and the sons of darkness .
speak , sirs , how was it ?
we four set upon some dozen sixteen at least , my lord .
and bound them .
no , no , they were not bound .
you rogue , they were bound , every man of them , or i am a jew else , an ebrew jew .
as we were sharing , some six or seven fresh men set upon us and unbound the rest , and then come in the other .
what , fought you with them all ?
all !
i know not what you call all , but if i fought not with fifty of them , i am a bunch of radish if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old jack , then am i no creature .
pray god you have not murdered some of them .
nay , that past praying for i have peppered two of them , two i am sure i have paid , two rogues in buckram suits .
i tell thee what , hal , if i tell thee a lie , spit in my face , call me horse .
thou knowest my old ward , here i lay and thus i bore my point .
four rogues in buckram let drive at me what , four ?
thou saidst but two even now .
four , hal , i told thee four .
ay , ay , he said four .
these four came all , and mainly thrust at me .
i made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target , thus .
seven ?
why , there were but four even now .
in buckram ?
ay , four , in buckram suits .
seven , by these hilts , or i am a villain else .
prithee , let him alone , we shall have more anon .
dost thou hear me , hal ?
ay , and mark thee too , jack .
do so , for it is worth the listening to .
these nine in buckram that i told thee of so , two more already .
their points being broken , down fell their hose .
began to give me ground but i followed me close , came in foot and hand , and with a thought seven of the eleven i paid .
o monstrous !
eleven buckram men grown out of two !
but , as the devil would have it , three misbegotten knaves in kendal green came at my back and let drive at me , for it was so dark , hal , that thou couldst not see thy hand .
these lies are like their father that begets them , gross as a mountain , open , palpable .
why , thou guts , thou fool , thou whoreson , obscene , grease , what , art thou mad ?
art thou mad ?
is not the truth the truth ?
why , how couldst thou know these men in kendal green , when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand ?
come , tell us your reason what sayest thou to this ?
come , your reason , jack , your reason .
what , upon compulsion ?
, an i were at the strappado , or all the racks in the world , i would not tell you on compulsion .
give you a reason on compulsion !
if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , i would give no man a reason upon compulsion , i .
i be no longer guilty of this sin , this sanguine coward , this , this , this huge hill of flesh , , you starveling , you , you dried neat tongue , you bull pizzle , you !
o for breath to utter what is like thee !
you , you sheath , you bowcase , you vile , well , breathe awhile , and then to it again and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons , hear me speak but this .
mark , jack .
we two saw you four set on four and bound them , and were masters of their wealth .
mark now , how a plain tale shall put you down .
then did we two set on you four , and , with a word , you from your prize , and have it , yea , and can show it you here in the house and , falstaff , you carried your guts away as nimbly , with as quick dexterity , and roared for mercy and still run and roared , as ever i heard .
what a slave art thou , to hack thy sword as thou hast done , and then say it was in fight !
what trick , what device , what , canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame ?
come , let hear , jack , what trick hast thou now ?
by the lord , i knew ye as well as he that made ye .
why , hear you , my masters was it for me to kill the ?
should i turn upon the true prince ?
why , thou knowest i am as valiant as hercules but beware instinct , the lion will not touch the true prince .
instinct is a great matter , i was now a coward on instinct .
i shall think the better of myself and thee during my life , i for a valiant lion , and thou for a true prince .
but , by the lord , lads , i am glad you have the money .
hostess , clap to the doors watch , pray .
gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold , all the titles of good fellowship come to you !
what , shall we be merry ?
shall we have a play extempore ?
content , and the argument shall be thy running away .
ah , no more of that , hal , an thou lovest me !
enter hostess o jesu , my lord the prince !
how now , my lady the hostess !
what sayest thou to me ?
marry , my lord , there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you he says he comes from your father .
give him as much as will make him a royal man , and send him back again to my mother .
what manner of man is he ?
an old man .
what doth gravity out of his bed at midnight ?
shall i give him his answer ?
prithee , do , jack .
, and i send him packing .
exit falstaff now , sirs by ' r lady , you fought fair , so did you , peto , so did you , bardolph you are lions too , you ran away upon instinct , you will not touch the true prince , no , fie !
, i ran when i saw others run .
, tell me now in earnest , how came falstaff sword so hacked ?
why , he hacked it with his dagger , and said he would swear truth out of england but he would make you believe it was done in fight , and persuaded us to do the like .
yea , and to tickle our noses with to make them bleed , and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men .
i did that i did not this seven year before , i blushed to hear his monstrous devices .
o villain , thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago , and wert taken with the manner , and ever since thou hast blushed extempore .
thou hadst fire and sword on thy side , and yet thou rannest away what instinct hadst thou for it ?
my lord , do you see these meteors ?
do you behold these exhalations ?
i do .
what think you they portend ?
hot livers and cold purses .
choler , my lord , if rightly taken .
no , if rightly taken , halter .
falstaff here comes lean jack , here comes .
how now , my sweet creature of bombast !
how long ago , jack , since thou sawest thine own knee ?
my own knee !
when i was about thy years , hal , i was not an eagle talon in the waist , i could have crept into any alderman a plague of sighing and grief !
it blows a man up like a bladder .
there villanous news abroad here was sir john bracy from your father , you must to the court in the morning .
that same mad fellow of the north , percy , and he of wales , that gave amamon the bastinado and made lucifer cuckold and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a welsh hook what a plague call you him ?
o , glendower .
owen , owen , the same , and his mortimer , and old northumberland , and that sprightly scot of scots , douglas , that runs o ' horseback up a hill perpendicular , he that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying .
you have hit it .
so did he never the sparrow .
well , that rascal hath good mettle in him , he will not run .
why , what a rascal art thou then , to praise him so for running !
o ' horseback , ye cuckoo , but afoot he will not budge a foot .
yes , jack , upon instinct .
i grant ye , upon instinct .
well , he is there too , and one mordake , and a thousand more worcester is stolen away , thy father beard is turned white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel .
why , then , it is like , if there come a hot june and this civil buffeting hold , we shall buy maidenheads as they buy , by the hundreds .
by the mass , lad , thou sayest true , it is like we shall have good trading that way .
but tell me , hal , art not thou horrible afeard ?
thou being , could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend douglas , that spirit percy , and that devil glendower ?
art thou not horribly afraid ?
doth not thy blood thrill at it ?
not a whit , i ' faith , i lack some of thy instinct .
well , thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father if thou love me , practise an answer .
do thou stand for my father , and examine me upon the particulars of my life .
shall i ?
content this chair shall be my state , this dagger my sceptre , and this cushion my crown .
thy state is taken for a , thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger , and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown !
well , an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee , now shalt thou be moved .
give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red , that it may be thought i have wept , for i must speak in passion , and i will do it in king cambyses ' vein .
well , here is my leg .
and here is my speech .
stand aside , nobility .
o jesu , this is excellent sport , i ' faith !
weep not , sweet queen , for trickling tears are vain .
o , the father , how he holds his countenance !
for god sake , lords , convey my tristful queen , for tears do stop the of her eyes .
o jesu , he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see !
peace , good , peace , good .
harry , i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time , but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile , the more it is trodden on the faster it grows , yet youth , the more it is wasted the sooner it wears .
that thou art my son , i have partly thy mother word , partly my own opinion , but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a of thy nether lip , that doth warrant me .
if then thou be son to me , here lies the point , why , being son to me , art thou so pointed at ?
shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries ?
a question not to be asked .
shall the sun of england prove a thief and take purses ?
a question to be asked .
there is a thing , harry , which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch , as ancient writers do report , doth defile , so doth the company thou keepest for , harry , now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears , not in pleasure but in passion , not in words only , but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have often noted in thy company , but i know not his name .
what manner of man , an it like your majesty ?
a goodly portly man , i ' faith , and a corpulent , of a cheerful look , a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage , and , as i think , his age some fifty , or , by ' r lady , inclining to three score , and now i remember me , his name is falstaff if that man should be lewdly given , he deceiveth me , for , harry , i see virtue in his looks .
if then the tree may be known by the fruit , as the fruit by the tree , then , peremptorily i speak it , there is virtue in that falstaff him keep with , the rest banish .
and tell me now , thou naughty varlet , tell me , where hast thou been this month ?
dost thou speak like a king ?
do thou stand for me , and i play my father .
depose me ?
if thou dost it half so gravely , so majestically , both in word and matter , hang me up by the heels for a or a poulter hare .
well , here i am set .
and here i stand judge , my masters .
now , harry , whence come you ?
my noble lord , from eastcheap .
the complaints i hear of thee are grievous .
, my lord , they are false nay , i tickle ye for a young prince , i ' faith .
swearest thou , ungracious boy ?
henceforth look on me .
thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man , a tun of man is thy companion .
why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours , that of beastliness , that swollen parcel of dropsies , that huge bombard of sack , that stuffed of guts , that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly , that reverend vice , that grey iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years ?
wherein is he good , but to taste sack and drink it ?
wherein neat and cleanly , but to carve a capon and eat it ?
wherein cunning , but in craft ?
wherein crafty , but in villany ?
wherein villanous , but in all things ?
wherein worthy , but in nothing ?
i would your grace would take me with you whom means your grace ?
that villanous abominable misleader of youth , falstaff , that old satan .
my lord , the man i know .
i know thou dost .
but to say i know more harm in him than in myself , were to say more than i know .
that he is old , the more the pity , his white hairs do witness it , but that he is , saving your reverence , a whoremaster , that i utterly deny .
if sack and sugar be a fault , god help the wicked !
if to be old and merry be a sin , then many an old host that i know is damned if to be fat be to be hated , then pharaoh lean kine are to be loved .
no , my good lord , banish peto , banish bardolph , banish poins but for sweet jack falstaff , kind jack falstaff , true jack falstaff , valiant jack falstaff , and therefore more valiant , being , as he is , old jack falstaff , banish not him thy harry company , banish not him thy harry company banish plump jack , and banish all the world .
i do , i will .
a knocking heard exeunt hostess , francis , and bardolph bardolph , running o , my lord , my lord !
the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door .
out , ye rogue !
play out the play i have much to say in the behalf of that falstaff .
the hostess o jesu , my lord , my lord !
heigh , heigh !
the devil rides upon a fiddlestick what the matter ?
the sheriff and all the watch are at the door they are come to search the house .
shall i let them in ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially mad , without seeming so .
and thou a natural coward , without instinct .
i deny your major if you will deny the sheriff , so , if not , let him enter if i become not a cart as well as another man , a plague on my bringing up !
i hope i shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another .
go , hide thee behind the arras the rest walk up above .
now , my masters , for a true face and good conscience .
both which i have had but their date is out , and therefore i hide me .
call in the sheriff .
exeunt all except prince henry and peto enter sheriff and the carrier now , master sheriff , what is your will with me ?
first , pardon me , my lord .
a hue and cry hath follow certain men unto this house .
what men ?
one of them is well known , my gracious lord , a gross fat man .
as fat as butter .
the man , i do assure you , is not here , for i myself at this time have employ him .
and , sheriff , i will engage my word to thee that i will , by , send him to answer thee , or any man , for any thing he shall be charged withal and so let me entreat you leave the house .
i will , my lord .
there are two gentlemen have in this robbery lost three hundred marks .
it may be so if he have robb these men , he shall be answerable , and so farewell .
good night , my noble lord .

act iii scene bangor .
the archdeacon house .
enter hotspur , worcester , mortimer , and glendower these promises are fair , the parties sure , and our induction full of prosperous hope .
lord mortimer , and cousin glendower , will you sit down ?
and uncle worcester a plague upon it !
i have forgot the map .
no , here it is .
sit , cousin percy , sit , good cousin hotspur , for by that name as oft as lancaster doth speak of you , his cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven .
and you in hell , as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of .
i can not blame him at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , of burning cressets , and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward .
why , so it would have done at the same season , if your mother cat had but kittened , though yourself had never been born .
i say the earth did shake when i was born .
and i say the earth was not of my mind , if you suppose as fearing you it shook .
the heavens were all on fire , the earth did tremble .
o , then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire , and not in fear of your nativity .
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions , oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch and vex by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb , which , for enlargement striving , shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and towers .
at your birth our grandam earth , having this distemperature , in passion shook .
cousin , of many men i do not bear these crossings .
give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , the goats ran from the mountains , and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields .
these signs have mark me extraordinary , and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men .
where is he living , clipp in with the sea that chides the banks of england , scotland , wales , which calls me pupil , or hath read to me ?
and bring him out that is but woman son can trace me in the tedious ways of art and hold me pace in deep experiments .
i think there no man speaks better welsh .
i to dinner .
peace , cousin percy , you will make him mad .
i can call spirits from the vasty deep .
why , so can i , or so can any man , but will they come when you do call for them ?
why , i can teach you , cousin , to command the devil .
and i can teach thee , coz , to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil .
if thou have power to raise him , bring him hither , and i be sworn i have power to shame him hence .
o , while you live , tell truth and shame the devil !
come , come , no more of this unprofitable chat .
three times hath henry bolingbroke made head against my power , thrice from the banks of wye and severn have i sent him bootless home and back .
home without boots , and in foul weather too !
how he agues , in the devil name ?
come , here the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ?
the archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally england , from trent and severn hitherto , by south and east is to my part assign all westward , wales beyond the severn shore , and all the fertile land within that bound , to owen glendower and , dear coz , to you the remnant northward , lying off from trent .
and our indentures tripartite are drawn , which being sealed interchangeably , a business that this night may execute , , cousin percy , you and i and my good lord of worcester will set forth to meet your father and the scottish power , as is appointed us , at shrewsbury .
my father glendower is not ready yet , not shall we need his help these fourteen days .
within that space you may have drawn together your tenants , friends and neighbouring gentlemen .
a shorter time shall send me to you , lords and in my conduct shall your ladies come , from whom you now must steal and take no leave , for there will be a world of water shed upon the parting of your wives and you .
methinks my moiety , north from burton here , in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in , and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge , a monstrous cantle out .
i have the current in this place damm up , and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel , fair and evenly , it shall not wind with such a deep indent , to rob me of so rich a bottom here .
not wind ?
it shall , it must , you see it doth .
yea , but mark how he bears his course , and runs me up with like advantage on the other side , gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you .
yea , but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land , and then he runs straight and even .
i have it so a little charge will do it .
i not have it alter .
will not you ?
no , nor you shall not .
who shall say me nay ?
why , that will i .
let me not understand you , then , speak it in welsh .
i can speak english , lord , as well as you , for i was train up in the english court , where , being but young , i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament , a virtue that was never seen in you .
marry , and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same metre , i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn , or a dry wheel grate on the , and that would set my teeth nothing on edge , nothing so much as mincing poetry is like the forced gait of a shuffling nag .
come , you shall have trent turn .
i do not care i give thrice so much land to any friend , but in the way of bargain , mark ye me , i cavil on the ninth part of a hair .
are the indentures drawn ?
shall we be gone ?
the moon shines fair , you may away by night i haste the writer and withal break with your wives of your departure hence i am afraid my daughter will run mad , so much she doteth on her mortimer .
exit glendower fie , cousin percy !
how you cross my father !
i can not choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant , of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies , and of a dragon and a finless fish , a griffin and a moulten raven , a couching lion and a ramping cat , and such a deal of stuff as puts me from my faith .
i tell you what , he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils ' names that were his lackeys i cried , ' and , go to , ' but mark him not a word .
o , he is as tedious as a tired horse , a railing wife , worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill , far , than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any in christendom .
in faith , he is a worthy gentleman , exceedingly well read , and profited in strange concealments , valiant as a lion and as wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india .
shall i tell you , cousin ?
he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come his humour , faith , he does i warrant you , that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done , without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft , let me entreat you .
in faith , my lord , you are too , and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience .
you must needs learn , lord , to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness , courage , blood , and that the dearest grace it renders you , yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage , defect of manners , want of government , pride , haughtiness , opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides , beguiling them of commendation .
well , i am school good manners be your speed !
here come our wives , and let us take our leave .
glendower with the ladies this is the deadly spite that angers me , my wife can speak no english , i no welsh .
my daughter weeps she will not part with you , she be a soldier too , she to the wars .
good father , tell her that she and my aunt percy shall follow in your conduct speedily .
glendower speaks to her in welsh , and she answers him in the same she is desperate here , a peevish harlotry , one that no persuasion can do good upon .
the lady speaks in welsh i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in , and , but for shame , in such a parley should i answer thee .
the lady speaks again in welsh i understand thy kisses and thou mine , and that a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant , love , till i have learned thy language , for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn , sung by a fair queen in a summer bower , with ravishing division , to her lute .
nay , if you melt , then will she run mad .
the lady speaks again in welsh o , i am ignorance itself in this !
she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap , and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep .
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness , making such difference wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the team begins his golden progress in the east .
with all my heart i sit and hear her sing by that time will our book , i think , be drawn do so , and those musicians that shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence , and straight they shall be here sit , and attend .
come , kate , thou art perfect in lying down come , quick , quick , that i may lay my head in thy lap .
go , ye giddy goose .
the music plays now i perceive the devil understands welsh , and is no marvel he is so humorous .
by ' r lady , he is a good musician .
then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours .
lie still , ye thief , and hear the lady sing in welsh .
i had rather hear lady , my brach , howl in irish .
wouldst thou have thy head broken ?
no .
then be still .
neither , is a woman fault .
now god help thee !
to the welsh lady bed .
what that ?
peace !
she sings .
here the lady sings a welsh song come , kate , i have your song too .
not mine , in good sooth .
not yours , in good sooth !
heart !
you swear like a wife .
you , in good sooth , ' and true as i live , ' and god shall mend me , ' and sure as day , ' and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths , as if thou never further than finsbury .
swear me , kate , like a lady as thou art , a good oath , and leave sooth , ' and such protest of , to and .
come , sing .
i will not sing .
is the next way to turn tailor , or be teacher .
an the indentures be drawn , i away within these two hours , and so , come in when ye will .
exit come , come , lord mortimer , you are as slow as hot lord percy is on fire to go .
by this our book is drawn , we but seal , and then to horse immediately .
with all my heart .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
the palace .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , and others lords , give us leave , the prince of wales and i must have some private conference , but be near at hand , for we shall presently have need of you .
exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so , for some displeasing service i have done , that , in his secret doom , out of my blood he breed revengement and a scourge for me , but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings .
tell me else , could such inordinate and low desires , such poor , such bare , such lewd , such mean attempts , such barren pleasures , rude society , as thou art match withal and grafted to , accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart ?
so please your majesty , i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg , as , in reproof of many tales devised , which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear , by smiling and base , i may , for some things true , wherein my youth hath faulty wander and irregular , find pardon on my true submission .
god pardon thee !
yet let me wonder , harry , at thy affections , which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors .
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost .
which by thy younger brother is supplied , and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruin , and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall .
had i so lavish of my presence been , so in the eyes of men , so stale and cheap to vulgar company , opinion , that did help me to the crown , had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment , a fellow of no mark nor likelihood .
by being seldom seen , i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder at , that men would tell their children is he , ' others would say , which is bolingbroke ? '
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven , and dress myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men hearts , loud shouts and salutations from their mouths , even in the presence of the crowned king .
thus did i keep my person fresh and new , my presence , like a robe pontifical , seen but wonder at and so my state , seldom but sumptuous , showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity .
the skipping king , he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits , soon kindled and soon burnt , carded his state , mingled his royalty with capering fools , had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance , against his name , to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative , grew a companion to the common streets , enfeoff himself to popularity , that , being daily swallow by men eyes , they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness , whereof a little more than a little is by much too much .
so when he had occasion to be seen , he was but as the cuckoo is in june , heard , not regarded , seen , but with such eyes as , sick and blunted with community , afford no extraordinary gaze , such as is bent on majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes , but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down , slept in his face and render such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries , being with his presence glutted , gorged and full .
and in that very line , harry , standest thou , for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is of thy common sight , save mine , which hath desired to see thee more , which now doth that i would not have it do , make blind itself with foolish tenderness .
i shall hereafter , my thrice gracious lord , be more myself .
for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh , and even as i was then is percy now .
now , by my sceptre and my soul to boot , he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession , for of no right , nor colour like to right , he doth fill fields with harness in the realm , turns head against the lion armed jaws , and , being no more in debt to years than thou , leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms .
what honour hath he got against renowned douglas !
whose high deeds , whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur , mars in swathling clothes , this infant warrior , in his enterprises discomfited great douglas , him once , enlarged him and made a friend of him , to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne .
and what say you to this ?
percy , northumberland , the archbishop grace of york , douglas , mortimer , capitulate against us and are up .
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee ?
why , harry , do i tell thee of my foes , which art my and dearest enemy ?
thou that art like enough , through vassal fear , base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy pay , to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns , to show how much thou art degenerate .
do not think so , you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have sway your majesty good thoughts away from me !
i will redeem all this on percy head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son , when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask , which , wash away , shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day , it lights , that this same child of honour and renown , this gallant hotspur , this knight , and your harry chance to meet .
for every honour sitting on his helm , would they were multitudes , and on my head my shames redoubled !
for the time will come , that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities .
percy is but my factor , good my lord , to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf , and i will call him to so strict account , that he shall render every glory up , yea , even the slightest worship of his time , or i will tear the reckoning from his heart .
this , in the name of god , i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform , i do beseech your majesty may salve the wounds of my intemperance if not , the end of life cancels all bands , and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow .
a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein .
enter blunt how now , good blunt ?
thy looks are full of speed .
so hath the business that i come to speak of .
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are , if promises be kept on every hand , as ever offer foul play in the state .
the earl of westmoreland set forth , with him my son , lord john of lancaster , for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next , harry , you shall set forward , on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and , harry , you shall march through gloucestershire , by which account , our business valued , some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet .
our hands are full of business let away , advantage feeds him fat , while men delay .
exeunt eastcheap .
the tavern .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , am i not fallen away vilely since this last action ?
do i not bate ?
do i not dwindle ?
why my skin hangs about me like an like an old lady loose gown , i am withered like an old .
well , i repent , and that suddenly , while i am in some liking , i shall be out of heart shortly , and then i shall have no strength to repent .
an i have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of , i am a peppercorn , a brewer horse the inside of a church !
company , villanous company , hath been the spoil of me .
sir john , you are so fretful , you can not live long .
why , there is it come sing me a bawdy song , make me merry .
i was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be , virtuous enough , swore little , diced not above seven times a week , went to a once in a quarter of an hour , paid money that i borrowed , three of four times , lived well and in good compass and now i live out of all order , out of all compass .
why , you are so fat , sir john , that you must needs be out of all compass , out of all reasonable compass , sir john .
do thou amend thy face , and i amend my life thou art our admiral , thou bearest the lantern in the poop , but is in the nose of thee , thou art the knight of the burning lamp .
why , sir john , my face does you no harm .
no , i be sworn , i make as good use of it as many a man doth of a or a memento mori i never see thy face but i think upon and dives that lived in purple , for there he is in his robes , burning , burning .
if thou wert any way given to virtue , i would swear by thy face , my oath should be this fire , that god angel ' but thou art altogether given over , and wert indeed , but for the light in thy face , the son of utter darkness .
when thou rannest up gadshill in the night to catch my horse , if i did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire , there no purchase in money .
o , thou art a perpetual triumph , an everlasting !
thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches , walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler in europe .
i have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years , god reward me for it !
, i would my face were in your belly !
!
so should i be sure to be .
enter hostess how now , dame partlet the hen !
have you inquired yet who picked my pocket ?
why , sir john , what do you think , sir john ?
do you think i keep thieves in my house ?
i have searched , i have inquired , so has my husband , man by man , boy by boy , servant by servant the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before .
ye lie , hostess bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair , and i be sworn my pocket was picked .
go to , you are a woman , go .
who , i ?
no , i defy thee god light , i was never called so in mine own house before .
go to , i know you well enough .
no , sir john , you do not know me , sir john .
i know you , sir john you owe me money , sir john , and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it i bought you a dozen of shirts to your back .
dowlas , filthy dowlas i have given them away to bakers ' wives , and they have made bolters of them .
now , as i am a true woman , holland of eight shillings an ell .
you owe money here besides , sir john , for your diet and , and money lent you , four and twenty pound .
he had his part of it , let him pay .
he ?
alas , he is poor , he hath nothing .
how !
poor ?
look upon his face , what call you rich ?
let them coin his nose , let them coin his cheeks ill not pay a denier .
what , will you make a younker of me ?
shall i not take mine case in mine inn but i shall have my pocket picked ?
i have lost a of my grandfather worth forty mark .
o jesu , i have heard the prince tell him , i know not how oft , that ring was copper !
how !
the prince is a jack , a , an he were here , i would cudgel him like a dog , if he would say so .
enter prince henry and peto , marching , and falstaff meets them playing on his truncheon like a life how now , lad !
is the wind in that door , i ' faith ?
must we all march ?
yea , two and two , newgate fashion .
my lord , i pray you , hear me .
what sayest thou , mistress quickly ?
how doth thy husband ?
i love him well , he is an honest man .
good my lord , hear me .
prithee , let her alone , and list to me .
what sayest thou , jack ?
the other night i fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket picked this house is turned , they pick pockets .
what didst thou lose , jack ?
wilt thou believe me , hal ?
three or four bonds of forty pound apiece , and a of my grandfather .
a trifle , some matter .
so i told him , my lord , and i said i heard your grace say so and , my lord , he speaks most vilely of you , like a man as he is , and said he would cudgel you .
what !
he did not ?
there neither faith , truth , nor womanhood in me else .
there no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune , nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox , and for womanhood , maid marian may be the deputy wife of the ward to thee .
go , you thing , go say , what thing ?
what thing ?
what thing !
why , a thing to thank god on .
i am no thing to thank god on , i would thou shouldst know it , i am an honest man wife and , setting thy knighthood aside , thou art a knave to call me so .
setting thy womanhood aside , thou art a beast to say otherwise .
say , what beast , thou knave , thou ?
what beast !
why , an otter .
an otter , sir john !
why an otter ?
why , she neither fish nor flesh , a man knows not where to have her .
thou art an unjust man in saying so thou or any man knows where to have me , thou knave , thou !
thou sayest true , hostess , and he slanders thee most grossly .
so he doth you , my lord , and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound .
sirrah , do i owe you a thousand pound ?
a thousand pound , ha !
a million thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love .
nay , my lord , he called you jack , and said he would cudgel you .
did i , bardolph ?
indeed , sir john , you said so .
yea , if he said my ring was copper .
i say is copper darest thou be as good as thy word now ?
why , hal , thou knowest , as thou art but man , i dare but as thou art prince , i fear thee as i fear the roaring of a lion whelp .
and why not as the lion ?
the king is to be feared as the lion dost thou think i fear thee as i fear thy father ?
nay , an i do , i pray god my girdle break .
o , if it should , how would thy guts fall about thy knees !
but , sirrah , there no room for faith , truth , nor honesty in this bosom of thine , it is all filled up with guts and midriff .
charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket !
why , thou whoreson , impudent , embossed rascal , if there were anything in thy pocket but , memorandums of , and one poor of to make thee , if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these , i am a villain and yet you will stand to if , you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
thou knowest in the state of innocency adam fell , and what should poor jack falstaff do in the days of villany ?
thou seest i have more flesh than another man , and therefore more frailty .
you confess then , you picked my pocket ?
it appears so by the story .
hostess , i forgive thee go , make ready breakfast , love thy husband , look to thy servants , cherish thy guests thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason thou seest i am pacified still .
nay , prithee , be gone .
exit hostess now hal , to the news at court for the robbery , lad , how is that answered ?
o , my sweet beef , i must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again .
o , i do not like that paying back , is a double labour .
i am good friends with my father and may do any thing .
rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest , and do it with unwashed hands too .
do , my lord .
i have procured thee , jack , a charge of foot .
i would it had been of horse .
where shall i find one that can steal well ?
o for a fine thief , of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts !
i am heinously unprovided .
well , god be thanked for these rebels , they offend none but the virtuous i laud them , i praise them .
bardolph !
my lord ?
go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster , to my brother john , this to my lord of westmoreland .
exit bardolph go , peto , to horse , to horse , for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time .
exit peto jack , meet me in the temple hall at two in the afternoon .
there shalt thou know thy charge , and there receive money and order for their furniture .
the land is burning , percy stands on high , and either we or they must lower lie .
exit prince henry rare words !
brave world !
hostess , my breakfast , come !
o , i could wish this tavern were my drum !
exit act iv scene i .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , and douglas well said , my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery , such attribution should the douglas have , as not a soldier of this season stamp should go so general current through the world .
by god , i can not flatter , i do defy the tongues of soothers , but a braver place in my heart love hath no man than yourself nay , task me to my word , approve me , lord .
thou art the king of honour no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him .
do so , and is well .
enter a messenger with letters what letters hast thou there ? i can but thank you .
these letters come from your father .
letters from him !
why comes he not himself ?
he can not come , my lord , he is grievous sick .
!
how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time ?
who leads his power ?
under whose government come they along ?
his letters bear his mind , not i , my lord .
i prithee , tell me , doth he keep his bed ?
he did , my lord , four days ere i set forth , and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear by his physicians .
i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now .
sick now !
droop now !
this sickness doth infect the very of our enterprise , is catching hither , even to our camp .
he writes me here , that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn , nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own .
yet doth he give us bold advertisement , that with our small conjunction we should on , to see how fortune is disposed to us , for , as he writes , there is no quailing now .
because the king is certainly possess of all our purposes .
what say you to it ?
your father sickness is a maim to us .
a perilous gash , a very limb lopp off and yet , in faith , it is not , his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast ?
to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour ?
it were not good , for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope , the very list , the very utmost bound of all our fortunes .
, and so we should , where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this .
a rendezvous , a home to fly unto .
if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs .
but yet i would your father had been here .
the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some , that know not why he is away , that wisdom , loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause , for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement , and stop all , every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father draws a curtain , that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of .
you strain too far .
i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion , a larger dare to our great enterprise , than if the earl were here , for men must think , if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom , with his help we shall it down .
yet all goes well , yet all our joints are whole .
as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear .
enter sir richard vernon my cousin vernon , welcome , by my soul .
pray god my news be worth a welcome , lord .
the earl of westmoreland , seven thousand strong , is marching hitherwards , with him prince john .
no harm what more ?
and further , i have learn , the king himself in person is set forth , or hitherwards intended speedily , with strong and mighty preparation .
he shall be welcome too .
where is his son , the madcap prince of wales , and his comrades , that daff the world aside , and bid it pass ?
all furnish , all in arms , all plumed like estridges that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed , glittering in golden coats , like images , as full of spirit as the month of may , and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer , wanton as youthful goats , wild as young bulls .
i saw young harry , with his beaver on , his cuisses on his thighs , gallantly arm rise from the ground like feather mercury , and vaulted with such ease into his seat , as if an angel dropp down from the clouds , to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship .
no more , no more worse than the sun in march , this praise doth nourish agues .
let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim , and to the maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood .
i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours .
come , let me taste my horse , who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall , hot horse to horse , meet and part till one drop down a corse .
o that glendower were come !
there is more news i learn in worcester , as i rode along , he can not draw his power this fourteen days .
that the worst tidings that i hear of yet .
ay , by my faith , that bears a frosty sound .
what may the king whole battle reach unto ?
to thirty thousand .
forty let it be my father and glendower being both away , the powers of us may serve so great a day come , let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near , die all , die merrily .
talk not of dying i am out of fear of death or death hand for this year .
exeunt scene ii .
a public road near coventry .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , get thee before to coventry , fill me a bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through , we to sutton ' tonight .
will you give me money , captain ?
lay out , lay out .
this bottle makes an angel .
an if it do , take it for thy labour , and if it make twenty , take them all , i answer the coinage .
bid my lieutenant peto meet me at town end .
i will , captain farewell .
exit if i be not ashamed of my soldiers , i am a soused gurnet .
i have misused the king press damnably .
i have got , in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers , three hundred and odd pounds .
i press me none but good , yeoman sons , inquire me out contracted bachelors , such as had been asked twice on the banns , such a commodity of warm slaves , as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum , such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt .
i pressed me none but such , with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins ' heads , and they have bought out their services , and now my whole charge consists of ancients , corporals , lieutenants , gentlemen of companies , slaves as ragged as lazarus in the painted cloth , where the glutton dogs licked his sores , and such as indeed were never soldiers , but discarded unjust , younger sons to younger brothers , revolted tapsters and ostlers , the cankers of a calm world and a long peace , ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient and such have i , to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services , that you would think that i had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from , from eating draff and husks .
a mad fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies .
no eye hath seen such scarecrows .
i not march through coventry with them , that flat nay , and the villains march wide betwixt the legs , as if they had gyves on , for indeed i had the most of them out of prison .
there but a shirt and a half in all my company , and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like an herald coat without sleeves , and the shirt , to say the truth , stolen from my host at saint alban , or the innkeeper of daventry .
but that all one , they find linen enough on every hedge .
enter the prince and westmoreland how now , blown jack !
how now , quilt !
what , hal !
how now , mad wag !
what a devil dost thou in warwickshire ?
my good lord of westmoreland , i cry you mercy i thought your honour had already been at shrewsbury .
faith , sir john , is more than time that i were there , and you too , but my powers are there already .
the king , i can tell you , looks for us all we must away all night .
tut , never fear me i am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream .
i think , to steal cream indeed , for thy theft hath already made thee butter .
but tell me , jack , whose fellows are these that come after ?
mine , hal , mine .
i did never see such pitiful rascals .
tut , tut , good enough to toss , food for powder , food for powder , they fill a pit as well as better tush , man , mortal men , mortal men .
ay , but , sir john , methinks they are exceeding poor and bare , too beggarly .
, for their poverty , i know not where they had that , and for their bareness , i am sure they never learned that of me .
no i be sworn , unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare .
but , sirrah , make haste percy is already in the field .
what , is the king encamped ?
he is , sir john i fear we shall stay too long .
well , to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest .
exeunt scene iii .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , douglas , and vernon we fight with him .
it may not be .
you give him then the advantage .
not a whit .
why say you so ?
looks he not for supply ?
so do we .
his is certain , ours is doubtful .
good cousin , be advised , stir not tonight .
do not , my lord .
you do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart .
do me no slander , douglas by my life , and i dare well maintain it with my life , if honour bid me on , i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you , my lord , or any scot that this day lives let it be seen in the battle which of us fears .
yea , or .
content .
, say i .
come , come it nay not be .
i wonder much , being men of such great leading as you are , that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition certain horse of my cousin vernon are not yet come up your uncle worcester horse came but today , and now their pride and mettle is asleep , their courage with hard labour tame and dull , that not a horse is half the half of himself .
so are the horses of the enemy in general , and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest .
the number of the king exceedeth ours for god sake .
cousin , stay till all come in .
the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king , if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect .
welcome , sir walter blunt , and would to god you were of our determination !
some of us love you well , and even those some envy your great deservings and good name , because you are not of our quality , but stand against us like an enemy .
and god defend but still i should stand so , so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty .
but to my charge .
the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs , and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility , teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty .
if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot , which he confesseth to be manifold , he bids you name your griefs , and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion .
the king is kind , and well we know the king knows at what time to promise , when to pay .
my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears , and when he was not six and twenty strong , sick in the world regard , wretched and low , a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home , my father gave him welcome to the shore , and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster , to sue his livery and beg his peace , with tears of innocency and terms of zeal , my father , in kind heart and pity moved , swore him assistance and perform it too .
now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him , the more and less came in with cap and knee , met him in boroughs , cities , villages , attended him on bridges , stood in lanes , laid gifts before him , proffer him their oaths , gave him their heirs , as pages follow him even at the heels in golden multitudes .
he presently , as greatness knows itself , steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father , while his blood was poor , upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh , and now , forsooth , takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth , cries out upon abuses , seems to weep over his country wrongs , and by this face , this seeming brow of justice , did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for , proceeded further , cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here , when he was personal in the irish war .
tut , i came not to hear this .
then to the point .
in short time after , he deposed the king , soon after that , deprived him of his life , and in the neck of that , task the whole state to make that worse , suffer his kinsman march , who is , if every owner were well placed , indeed his king , to be engaged in wales , there without ransom to lie forfeited , disgraced me in my happy victories , sought to entrap me by intelligence , rated mine uncle from the , in rage dismiss my father from the court , broke oath on oath , committed wrong on wrong , and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety , and withal to pry into his title , the which we find too indirect for long continuance .
shall i return this answer to the king ?
not so , sir walter we withdraw awhile .
go to the king , and let there be impawn some surety for a safe return again , and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell .
i would you would accept of grace and love .
and may be so we shall .
pray god you do .
exeunt scene iv .
york .
the archbishop palace .
enter the archbishop of york and sir michael hie , good sir michael , bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal , this to my cousin scroop , and all the rest to whom they are directed .
if you knew how much they do to import , you would make haste .
my good lord , i guess their tenor .
like enough you do .
, good sir michael , is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch , for , sir , at shrewsbury , as i am truly given to understand , the king with mighty and power meets with lord harry and , i fear , sir michael , what with the sickness of northumberland , whose power was in the first proportion , and what with owen glendower absence thence , who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in , by prophecies , i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king .
why , my good lord , you need not fear , there is douglas and lord mortimer .
no , mortimer is not there .
but there is mordake , vernon , lord harry percy , and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors , noble gentlemen .
and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales , lord john of lancaster , the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt , and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms .
doubt not , my lord , they shall be well opposed .
i hope no less , yet needful is to fear , and , to prevent the worst , sir michael , speed for if lord percy thrive not , ere the king dismiss his power , he means to visit us , for he hath heard of our confederacy , and is but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste .
i must go write again to other friends , and so farewell , sir michael .
exeunt act v scene i .
king henry iv camp near shrewsbury .
enter king henry , prince henry , lord john of lancaster , earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and falstaff how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill !
the day looks pale at his distemperature .
the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes , and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blustering day .
then with the losers let it sympathize , for nothing can seem foul to those that win .
the trumpet sounds enter worcester and vernon how now , my lord of worcester !
is not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet .
you have deceived our trust , and made us doff our easy robes of peace , to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well , my lord , this is not well .
what say you to it ?
will you again unknit this curlish knot of war ?
and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light , and be no more an exhaled meteor , a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times ?
hear me , my liege for mine own part , i could be well content to entertain the of my life with quiet hours , for i do protest , i have not sought the day of this dislike .
you have not sought it !
how comes it , then ?
rebellion lay in his way , and he found it .
peace , chewet , peace !
it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house , and yet i must remember you , my lord , we were the first and dearest of your friends .
for you my staff of office did i break in richard time , and posted day and night to meet you on the way , and kiss your hand , when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i .
it was myself , my brother and his son , that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time .
you swore to us , and you did swear that oath at doncaster , that you did nothing purpose the state , nor claim no further than your right , the seat of gaunt , dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid .
but in short space it rain down fortune showering on your head , and such a flood of greatness fell on you , what with our help , what with the absent king , what with the injuries of a wanton time , the seeming sufferances that you had borne , and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly woo to gripe the general sway into your hand , forget your oath to us at doncaster , and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull , the cuckoo bird , useth the sparrow , did oppress our nest , grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing , but with nimble wing we were enforced , for safety sake , to fly out of sight and raise this present head , whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage , dangerous countenance , and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise .
these things indeed you have articulate , proclaim at , read in churches , to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents , which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such to impaint his cause , nor moody beggars , starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion .
in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter , if once they join in trial .
tell your nephew , the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes , this present enterprise set off his head , i do not think a braver gentleman , more or more , more daring or more bold , is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds .
for my part , i may speak it to my shame , i have a truant been to chivalry , and so i hear he doth account me too , yet this before my father majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation , and will , to save the blood on either side , try fortune with him in a single fight .
and , prince of wales , so dare we venture thee , albeit considerations infinite do make against it .
no , good worcester , no , we love our people well , even those we love that are misled upon your cousin part , and , will they take the offer of our grace , both he and they and you , every man shall be my friend again and i be his so tell your cousin , and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield , rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office .
so , be gone , we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair , take it advisedly .
exeunt worcester and vernon it will not be accepted , on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms .
hence , therefore , every leader to his charge , for , on their answer , will we set on them and god befriend us , as our cause is just !
exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff hal , if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me , so , is a point of friendship .
nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship .
say thy prayers , and farewell .
i would , hal , and all well .
why , thou owest god a death .
exit prince henry is not due yet , i would be loath to pay him before his day .
what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me ?
well , is no matter , honour pricks me on .
yea , but how if honour prick me off when i come on ?
how then ?
can honour set to a leg ?
no or an arm ?
no or take away the grief of a wound ?
no .
honour hath no skill in surgery , then ?
no .
what is honour ?
a word .
what is in that word honour ?
what is that honour ?
air .
a trim reckoning !
who hath it ?
he that died o ' wednesday .
doth he feel it ?
no .
doth he hear it ?
no .
is insensible , then .
yea , to the dead .
but will it not live with the living ?
no .
why ?
detraction will not suffer it .
therefore i none of it .
honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism .
exit scene ii .
the rebel camp .
enter worcester and vernon o , no , my nephew must not know , sir richard , the liberal and kind offer of the king .
best he did .
then are we all undone .
it is not possible , it can not be , the king should keep his word in loving us , he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes , for treason is but trusted like the fox , who , so tame , so cherish and lock up , will have a wild trick of his ancestors .
look how we can , or sad or merrily , interpretation will misquote our looks , and we shall feed like oxen at a stall , the better cherish , still the nearer death .
my nephew trespass may be well forgot , it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood , and an adopted name of privilege , a hotspur , govern by a spleen all his offences live upon my head and on his father , we did train him on , and , his corruption being from us , we , as the spring of all , shall pay for all .
therefore , good cousin , let not harry know , in any case , the offer of the king .
deliver what you will , i say is so .
here comes your cousin .
enter hotspur and douglas my uncle is return deliver up my lord of westmoreland .
uncle , what news ?
the king will bid you battle presently .
defy him by the lord of westmoreland .
lord douglas , go you and tell him so .
marry , and shall , and very willingly .
exit there is no seeming mercy in the king .
did you beg any ?
god forbid !
i told him gently of our grievances , of his , which he mended thus , by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels , traitors , and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us .
the earl of douglas arm , gentlemen , to arms !
for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry teeth , and westmoreland , that was engaged , did bear it , which can not choose but bring him quickly on .
the prince of wales stepp forth before the king , and , nephew , challenged you to single fight .
o , would the quarrel lay upon our heads , and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth !
tell me , tell me , how show his tasking ?
seem it in contempt ?
no , by my soul , i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly , unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms .
he gave you all the duties of a man , trimm up your praises with a princely tongue , spoke to your deservings like a chronicle , making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued in you , and , which became him like a prince indeed , he made a blushing cital of himself , and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he master there a double spirit .
of teaching and of learning instantly .
there did he pause but let me tell the world , if he outlive the envy of this day , england did never owe so sweet a hope , so much misconstrued in his wantonness .
cousin , i think thou art enamoured on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a libertine .
but be he as he will , yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier arm , that he shall shrink under my courtesy .
arm , arm with speed and , fellows , soldiers , friends , better consider what you have to do than i , that have not well the gift of tongue , can lift your blood up with persuasion .
enter a messenger my lord , here are letters for you .
i can not read them now .
o gentlemen , the time of life is short !
to spend that shortness basely were too long , if life did ride upon a dial point , still ending at the arrival of an hour .
an if we live , we live to tread on kings , if die , brave death , when princes die with us !
now , for our consciences , the arms are fair , when the intent of bearing them is just .
enter another messenger my lord , prepare , the king comes on apace .
i thank him , that he cuts me from my tale , for i profess not talking , only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword , whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day .
now , esperance !
percy !
and set on .
sound all the lofty instruments of war , and by that music let us all embrace , for , heaven to earth , some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy .

what honour dost thou seek upon my head ?
know then , my name is douglas , and i do haunt thee in the battle thus because some tell me that thou art a king .
they tell thee true .
the lord of stafford dear hath bought thy likeness , for instead of thee , king harry , this sword hath ended him so shall it thee , unless thou yield thee as my prisoner .
i was not born a yielder , thou proud scot , and thou shalt find a king that will revenge lord stafford death .
they fight .
douglas kills sir walter blunt .

but who comes here ?
enter prince henry what , thou idle here ?
lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies , whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee , lend me thy sword .
o hal , i prithee , give me leave to breathe awhile .
turk gregory never did such deeds in arms as i have done this day .
i have paid percy , i have made him sure .
he is , indeed , and living to kill thee .
i prithee , lend me thy sword .
nay , before god , hal , if percy be alive , thou not my sword , but take my pistol , if thou wilt .
give it to me what , is it in the case ?
ay , hal , is hot , is hot , there that will sack a city .
prince henry draws it out , and finds it to be a bottle of sack what , is it a time to jest and dally now ?
he throws the bottle at him .
exit well , if percy be alive , i pierce him .
if he do come in my way , so if he do not , if i come in his willingly , let him make a carbonado of me .

i will do so .

come , my lord , i lead you to your tent .
lead me , my lord ?
i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this , where stain nobility lies trodden on , and rebels ' arms triumph in massacres !

exeunt lancaster and westmoreland by god , thou hast deceived me , lancaster , i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before , i loved thee as a brother , john , but now , i do respect thee as my soul .

i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but , seeing thou on me so luckily , i will assay thee so , defend thyself .

stay , and breathe awhile thou hast redeem thy lost opinion , and show thou makest some tender of my life , in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me .
o god !
they did me too much injury that ever said i hearken for your death .

my name is harry percy .
why , then i see a very valiant rebel of the name .
i am the prince of wales , and think not , percy , to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere , nor can one england brook a double reign , of harry percy and the prince of wales .
nor shall it , harry , for the hour is come to end the one of us , and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine !
i make it greater ere i part from thee , and all the budding honours on thy crest i crop , to make a garland for my head .
i can no longer brook thy vanities .

hotspur is wounded , and falls o , harry , thou hast robb me of my youth !
i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me , they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh but thought the slave of life , and life time fool , and time , that takes survey of all the world , must have a stop .
o , i could prophesy , but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no , percy , thou art dust and food for dies for worms , brave percy fare thee well , great heart !
ambition , how much art thou shrunk !
when that this body did contain a spirit , a kingdom for it was too small a bound , but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman .
if thou wert sensible of courtesy , i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favours hide thy mangled face , and , even in thy behalf , i thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness .
adieu , and take thy praise with thee to heaven !
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave , but not remember in thy epitaph !

could not all this flesh keep in a little life ?
poor jack , farewell !
i could have better spared a better man o , i should have a heavy miss of thee , if i were much in love with vanity !
death hath not struck so fat a deer , though many dearer , in this bloody fray .
embowell will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie .

if thou embowel me , i give you leave to powder me and eat me too .

counterfeit ?
i lie , i am no counterfeit to die , is to be a counterfeit , for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying , when a man thereby liveth , is to be no counterfeit , but the true and perfect image of life indeed .
the better part of valour is discretion , in the which better part i have saved my life .
, i am afraid of this gunpowder percy , though he be dead how , if he should counterfeit too and rise ?
by my faith , i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit .
therefore i make him sure , yea , and i swear i killed him .
why may not he rise as well as i ?
nothing confutes me but eyes , and nobody sees me .
therefore , sirrah , stabbing him with a new wound in your thigh , come you along with me .

but , soft !
whom have we here ?
did you not tell me this fat man was dead ?
i did , i saw him dead , breathless and bleeding on the ground .
art thou alive ?
or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight ?
i prithee , speak , we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou .
no , that certain , i am not a double man but if i be not jack falstaff , then am i a jack .
there is percy throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour , so , if not , let him kill the next percy himself .
i look to be either earl or duke , i can assure you .
why , percy i killed myself and saw thee dead .
didst thou ?
lord , lord , how this world is given to lying !
i grant you i was down and out of breath , and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock .
if i may be believed , so , if not , let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads .
i take it upon my death , i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it , , i would make him eat a piece of my sword .
this is the strangest tale that ever i heard .
this is the strangest fellow , brother john .
come , bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part , if a lie may do thee grace , i gild it with the happiest terms i have .
a retreat is sounded the trumpet sounds retreat , the day is ours .
come , brother , let us to the highest of the field , to see what friends are living , who are dead .
exeunt prince henry and lancaster i follow , as they say , for reward .
he that rewards me , god reward him !
if i do grow great , i grow less , for i purge , and leave sack , and live cleanly as a nobleman should do .
exit scene another part of the field .
the trumpets sound .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , lord john lancaster , earl of westmoreland , with worcester and vernon prisoners thus ever did rebellion find rebuke .
worcester !
did not we send grace , pardon and terms of love to all of you ?
and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary ?
misuse the tenor of thy kinsman trust ?
three knights upon our party slain , a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour , if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence .
what i have done my safety urged me to , and i embrace this fortune patiently , since not to be avoided it falls on me .
bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon .
exeunt worcester and vernon , guarded how goes the field ?
the noble scot , lord douglas , when he saw the fortune of the day quite turn from him , the noble percy slain , and all his men upon the foot of fear , fled with the rest , and falling from a hill , he was so bruised that the pursuers took him .
at my tent the douglas is , and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him .
with all my heart .
then , brother john of lancaster , to you this honourable bounty shall belong go to the douglas , and deliver him up to his pleasure , ransomless and free his valour shown upon our crests hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries .
i thank your grace for this high courtesy , which i shall give away immediately .
then this remains , that we divide our power .
you , son john , and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed , to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop , who , as we hear , are busily in arms myself and you , son harry , will towards wales , to fight with glendower and the earl of march .
rebellion in this land shall lose his sway , meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done , let us not leave till all our own be won .
exeunt act i scene westminster abbey .
dead march .
enter the funeral of king henry the fifth , attended on by dukes of bedford , regent of france , gloucester , protector , and exeter , earl of warwick , the bishop of winchester , heralds , and c hung be the heavens with black , yield day to night !
comets , importing change of times and states , brandish your crystal tresses in the sky , and with them scourge the bad revolting stars that have consented unto henry death !
king henry the fifth , too famous to live long !
england lost a king of so much worth .
england had a king until his time .
virtue he had , deserving to command his brandish sword did blind men with his beams his arms spread wider than a dragon wings , his sparking eyes , replete with wrathful fire , more dazzled and drove back his enemies than sun fierce bent against their faces .
what should i say ?
his deeds exceed all speech he lift up his hand but conquered .
we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood ?
henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend , and death dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify , like captives bound to a triumphant car .
what !
shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glory overthrow ?
or shall we think the french conjurers and sorcerers , that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end ?
bishop he was a king bless of the king of kings .
unto the french the dreadful so dreadful will not be as was his sight .
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the church prayers made him so prosperous .
the church !
where is it ?
had not churchmen pray , his thread of life had not so soon decay none do you like but an effeminate prince , whom , like a , you may .
bishop gloucester , we like , thou art protector and lookest to command the prince and realm .
thy wife is proud , she holdeth thee in awe , more than god or religious churchmen may .
name not religion , for thou lovest the flesh , and throughout the year to church thou except it be to pray against thy foes .
cease , cease these jars and rest your minds in peace let to the altar heralds , wait on us instead of gold , we offer up our arms since arms avail not now that henry dead .
posterity , await for wretched years , when at their mothers ' moist eyes babes shall suck , our isle be made a nourish of salt tears , and none but women left to wail the dead .
henry the fifth , thy ghost i invocate prosper this realm , keep it from civil broils , combat with adverse planets in the heavens !
a far more glorious star thy soul will make than julius caesar or bright enter a messenger my honourable lords , health to you all !
sad tidings bring i to you out of france , of loss , of slaughter and discomfiture guienne , champagne , rheims , orleans , paris , guysors , poictiers , are all quite lost .
what thou , man , before dead henry corse ?
speak softly , or the loss of those great towns will make him burst his lead and rise from death .
is paris lost ?
is rouen yielded up ?
if henry were recall to life again , these news would cause him once more yield the ghost .
how were they lost ?
what treachery was used ?
no treachery , but want of men and money .
amongst the soldiers this is muttered , that here you maintain several factions , and whilst a field should be dispatch and fought , you are disputing of your generals one would have lingering wars with little cost , another would fly swift , but wanteth wings , a third thinks , without expense at all , by guileful fair words peace may be obtain .
awake , awake , english nobility !
let not sloth dim your horrors cropp are the in your arms , of england coat one half is cut away .
were our tears wanting to this funeral , these tidings would call forth their flowing tides .
me they concern , regent i am of france .
give me my steeled coat .
i fight for france .
away with these disgraceful wailing robes !
wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes , to weep their intermissive miseries .
enter to them another messenger lords , view these letters full of bad mischance .
france is revolted from the english quite , except some petty towns of no import the dauphin charles is crowned king of rheims , the bastard of orleans with him is join , reignier , duke of anjou , doth take his part , the duke of alencon flieth to his side .
the dauphin crowned king !
all fly to him !
o , whither shall we fly from this reproach ?
we will not fly , but to our enemies ' throats .
bedford , if thou be slack , i fight it out .
gloucester , why thou of my forwardness ?
an army have i muster in my thoughts , wherewith already france is overrun .
enter another messenger my gracious lords , to add to your laments , wherewith you now bedew king henry hearse , i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french .
bishop what !
wherein talbot overcame ?
so ?
o , no , wherein lord talbot was the circumstance i tell you more at large .
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord , retiring from the siege of orleans , having full scarce six thousand in his troop .
by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon .
no leisure had he to enrank his men , he wanted pikes to set before his archers , instead whereof sharp stakes pluck out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly , to keep the horsemen off from breaking in .
more than three hours the fight continued , where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell , and none durst stand him , here , there , and every where , enraged he flew the french exclaim , the devil was in arms , all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot !
a talbot !
cried out amain and rush into the bowels of the battle .
here had the conquest fully been seal up , if sir john fastolfe had not play the coward he , being in the vaward , placed behind with purpose to relieve and follow them , cowardly fled , not having struck one stroke .
hence grew the general wreck and massacre , enclosed were they with their enemies a base walloon , to win the dauphin grace , thrust talbot with a spear into the back , whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face .
is talbot slain ?
then i will slay myself , for living idly here in pomp and ease , whilst such a worthy leader , wanting aid , unto his dastard foemen is betray .
o no , he lives , but is took prisoner , and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughter or took likewise .
his ransom there is none but i shall pay i hale the dauphin headlong from his throne his crown shall be the ransom of my friend , four of their lords i change for one of ours .
farewell , my masters , to my task will i , bonfires in france forthwith i am to make , to keep our great saint george feast withal ten thousand soldiers with me i will take , whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake .
so you had need , for orleans is besieged , the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply , and hardly keeps his men from mutiny , since they , so few , watch such a multitude .
remember , lords , your oaths to henry sworn , either to quell the dauphin utterly , or bring him in obedience to your yoke .
i do remember it , and here take my leave , to go about my preparation .
exit i to the tower with all the haste i can , to view the artillery and munition , and then i will proclaim young henry king .
exit to eltham will i , where the young king is , being ordain his special governor , and for his safety there i best devise .
exit bishop each hath his place and function to attend i am left out , for me nothing remains .
but long i will not be jack out of office the king from eltham i intend to steal and sit at chiefest stern of public weal .
exeunt scene ii .
france .
before orleans .
sound a flourish .
enter charles , alencon , and reignier , marching with drum and soldiers mars his true moving , even as in the heavens so in the earth , to this day is not known late did he shine upon the english side , now we are victors , upon us he smiles .
what towns of any moment but we have ?
at pleasure here we lie near orleans , otherwhiles the famish english , like pale ghosts , faintly besiege us one hour in a month .
they want their porridge and their fat either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they will look , like drowned mice .
let raise the siege why live we idly here ?
talbot is taken , whom we wont to fear remaineth none but salisbury , and he may well in fretting spend his gall , nor men nor money hath he to make war .
sound , sound alarum !
we will rush on them .
now for the honour of the forlorn french !
him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly .
exeunt here alarum , they are beaten back by the english with great loss .
charles , alencon , and reignier who ever saw the like ?
what men have i !
dogs !
cowards !
dastards !
i would have fled , but that they left me my enemies .
salisbury is a desperate homicide , he fighteth as one weary of his life .
the other lords , like lions wanting food , do rush upon us as their hungry prey .
froissart , a countryman of ours , records , england all olivers and rowlands bred , during the time edward the third did reign .
more truly now may this be verified , for none but samsons and goliases it sendeth forth to skirmish .
one to ten !
lean , rascals !
who would suppose they had such courage and audacity ?
let leave this town , for they are slaves , and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them , rather with their teeth the walls they tear down than forsake the siege .
i think , by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks , stiff to strike on , else could they hold out so as they do .
by my consent , we even let them alone .
be it so .
enter the bastard of orleans where the prince dauphin ?
i have news for him .
bastard of orleans , thrice welcome to us .
methinks your looks are sad , your cheer appall hath the late overthrow wrought this offence ?
be not dismay , for succor is at hand a holy maid hither with me i bring , which by a vision sent to her from heaven ordained is to raise this tedious siege and drive the english forth the bounds of france .
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath , exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome what past and what to come she can descry .
speak , shall i call her in ?
believe my words , for they are certain and unfallible .
go , call her in .
exit bastard of orleans but first , to try her skill , reignier , stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly , let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath .
the bastard of orleans , with joan la pucelle fair maid , thou wilt do these wondrous feats ?
reignier , thou that thinkest to beguile me ?
where is the dauphin ?
come , come from behind , i know thee well , though never seen before .
be not amazed , there nothing hid from me in private will i talk with thee apart .
stand back , you lords , and give us leave awhile .
she takes upon her bravely at first dash .
dauphin , i am by birth a shepherd daughter , my wit untrain in any kind of art .
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased to shine on my contemptible estate lo , whilst i waited on my tender lambs , and to sun parching heat display my cheeks , god mother deigned to appear to me and in a vision full of majesty will me to leave my base vocation and free my country from calamity her aid she promised and assured success in complete glory she reveal herself , and , whereas i was black and swart before , with those clear rays which she infused on me that beauty am i bless with which you see .
ask me what question thou canst possible , and i will answer unpremeditated my courage try by combat , if thou darest , and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex .
resolve on this , thou shalt be fortunate , if thou receive me for thy warlike mate .
thou hast astonish me with thy high terms only this proof i of thy valour make , in single combat thou shalt buckle with me , and if thou vanquishest , thy words are true , otherwise i renounce all confidence .
i am prepared here is my sword , deck with five on each side , the which at touraine , in saint katharine churchyard , out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth .
then come , o ' god name , i fear no woman .
and while i live , i fly from a man .
here they fight , and joan la pucelle overcomes stay , stay thy hands !
thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah .
christ mother helps me , else i were too weak .
helps thee , is thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire , my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued .
excellent pucelle , if thy name be so , let me thy servant and not sovereign be is the french dauphin sueth to thee thus .
i must not yield to any rites of love , for my profession sacred from above when i have chased all thy foes from hence , then will i think upon a recompense .
meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall .
my lord , methinks , is very long in talk .
doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock , else could he so long protract his speech .
shall we disturb him , since he keeps no mean ?
he may mean more than we poor men do know these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues .
my lord , where are you ?
what devise you on ?
shall we give over orleans , or no ?
why , no , i say , distrustful recreants !
fight till the last gasp , i will be your guard .
what she says i confirm we fight it out .
assign am i to be the english scourge .
this night the siege assuredly i raise expect saint martin summer , halcyon days , since i have entered into these wars .
glory is like a circle in the water , which never ceaseth to enlarge itself till by broad spreading it disperse to nought .
with henry death the english circle ends , dispersed are the glories it included .
now am i like that proud insulting ship which caesar and his fortune bare at once .
was mahomet inspired with a dove ?
thou with an eagle art inspired then .
helen , the mother of great constantine , nor yet saint philip daughters , were like thee .
bright star of venus , down on the earth , how may i reverently worship thee enough ?
leave off delays , and let us raise the siege .
woman , do what thou canst to save our honours , drive them from orleans and be immortalized .
presently we try come , let away about it no prophet will i trust , if she prove false .

before the tower .
enter gloucester , with his in blue coats i am come to survey the tower this day since henry death , i fear , there is conveyance .
where be these warders , that they wait not here ?

who willed you ?
or whose will stands but mine ?

break up the gates , i be your warrantize .
shall i be flouted thus by dunghill grooms ?
gloucester men rush at the tower gates , and woodvile the lieutenant speaks within what noise is this ?
what traitors have we here ?
lieutenant , is it you whose voice i hear ?
open the gates , here gloucester that would enter .
have patience , noble duke , i may not open , the cardinal of winchester forbids from him i have express commandment that thou nor none of thine shall be let in .
woodvile , prizest him me ?
arrogant winchester , that haughty prelate , whom henry , our late sovereign , could brook ?
thou art no friend to god or to the king open the gates , or i shut thee out shortly .
open the gates unto the lord protector , or we burst them open , if that you come not quickly .
enter to the protector at the tower gates bishop of winchester and his men in tawny coats bishop how now , ambitious humphry !
what means this ?
peel priest , dost thou command me to be shut out ?
bishop i do , thou most usurping proditor , and not protector , of the king or realm .

bishop nay , stand thou back , i will not budge a foot this be damascus , be thou cursed cain , to slay thy brother abel , if thou wilt .
i will not slay thee , but i drive thee back thy scarlet robes as a child i use to carry thee out of this place .
bishop do what thou darest , i beard thee to thy face .

am i dared and bearded to my face ?
draw , men , for all this privileged place , blue coats to tawny coats .
priest , beware your beard , i mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly under my feet i stamp thy cardinal hat in spite of pope or dignities of church , here by the cheeks i drag thee up and down .
bishop gloucester , thou wilt answer this before the pope .
winchester goose , i cry , a rope !
a rope !
now beat them hence , why do you let them stay ?
thee i chase hence , thou wolf in sheep array .
out , tawny coats !

here gloucester men beat out bishop of winchester men , and enter in the burly the mayor of london and his officers fie , lords !
that you , being supreme magistrates , thus contumeliously should break the peace !
peace , mayor !
thou little of my wrongs here beaufort , that regards nor god nor king , hath here distrain the tower to his use .
bishop here gloucester , a foe to citizens , one that still motions war and never peace , your free purses with large fines , that seeks to overthrow religion , because he is protector of the realm , and would have armour here out of the tower , to crown himself king and suppress the prince .
i will not answer thee with words , but blows .
here they skirmish again naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife but to make open proclamation come , officer , as loud as thou canst , cry .
all manner of men assembled here in arms this day against god peace and the king , we charge and command you , in his highness ' name , to repair to your several , and not to wear , handle , or use any sword , weapon , or dagger , henceforward , upon pain of death .
cardinal , i be no breaker of the law but we shall meet , and break our minds at large .
bishop gloucester , we will meet , to thy cost , be sure thy i will have for this day work .
i call for clubs , if you will not away .

enter , on the walls , a master gunner and his boy sirrah , thou how orleans is besieged , and how the english have the suburbs won .
father , i know , and oft have shot at them , unfortunate i miss my aim .
but now thou shalt not .
be thou ruled by me chief am i of this town , something i must do to procure me grace .
the prince espials have informed me how the english , in the suburbs close intrench , wont , through a secret grate of iron bars in yonder tower , to overpeer the city , and thence discover how with most advantage they may vex us with shot , or with assault .
to intercept this inconvenience , a piece of ordnance it i have placed , and even these three days have i watch , if i could see them .
now do thou watch , for i can stay no longer .
if thou any , run and bring me word , and thou shalt find me at the governor .
exit father , i warrant you , take you no care , i never trouble you , if i may spy them .
exit enter , on the turrets , salisbury and talbot , glansdale , gargrave , and others talbot , my life , my joy , again return !
how wert thou handled being prisoner ?
or by what means thou to be released ?
discourse , i prithee , on this turret top .
the duke of bedford had a prisoner call the brave lord ponton de santrailles , for him was i exchanged and ransomed .
but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have barter me which i , disdaining , scorn , and craved death , rather than i would be so vile esteem .
in fine , redeem i was as i desired .
but , o !
the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart , whom with my bare fists i would execute , if i now had him brought into my power .
yet thou not how thou wert entertain .
with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts .
in open produced they me , to be a public spectacle to all here , said they , is the terror of the french , the scarecrow that affrights our children so .
then broke i from the officers that led me , and with my nails digg stones out of the ground , to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly , none durst come near for fear of sudden death .
in iron walls they deem me not secure , so great fear of my name them was spread , that they supposed i could rend bars of steel , and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had , that walked about me every , and if i did but stir out of my bed , ready they were to shoot me to the heart .
enter the boy with a linstock i grieve to hear what torments you endured , but we will be revenged sufficiently now it is in orleans here , through this grate , i count each one and view the frenchmen how they fortify let us look in , the sight will much delight thee .
sir thomas gargrave , and sir william glansdale , let me have your express opinions where is best place to make our battery next .
i think , at the north gate , for there stand lords .
and i , here , at the bulwark of the bridge .
for aught i see , this city must be famish , or with light skirmishes enfeebled .
here they shoot .
salisbury and gargrave fall o lord , have mercy on us , wretched sinners !
o lord , have mercy on me , woful man !
what chance is this that suddenly hath cross us ?
speak , salisbury , at least , if thou canst speak how farest thou , mirror of all martial men ?
one of thy eyes and thy cheek side struck off !
accursed tower !
accursed fatal hand that hath contrived this woful tragedy !
in thirteen battles salisbury , henry the fifth he first train to the wars , whilst any trump did sound , or drum struck up , his sword did leave striking in the field .
yet livest thou , salisbury ?
though thy speech doth fail , one eye thou hast , to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world .
heaven , be thou gracious to none alive , if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands !
bear hence his body , i will help to bury it .
sir thomas gargrave , hast thou any life ?
speak unto talbot , nay , look up to him .
salisbury , cheer thy spirit with this comfort , thou shalt not die whiles he beckons with his hand and smiles on me .
as who should say i am dead and gone , remember to avenge me on the french . '
plantagenet , i will , and like thee , nero , play on the lute , beholding the towns burn wretched shall france be only in my name .
here an alarum , and it thunders and lightens what stir is this ?
what tumult in the heavens ?
whence cometh this alarum and the noise ?

it irks his heart he can not be revenged .
frenchmen , i be a salisbury to you pucelle or puzzel , dolphin or dogfish , your hearts i stamp out with my horse heels , and make a quagmire of your mingled brains .

my breast i burst with straining of my courage and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder .
but i will chastise this strumpet .

a short alarum , then enter the town with soldiers me , if thou canst , i scorn thy strength .
go , go , cheer up thy men , help salisbury to make his testament this day is ours , as many more shall be .
exit my thoughts are whirled like a potter wheel , i know not where i am , nor what i do , a witch , by fear , not force , like hannibal , drives back our troops and conquers as she lists so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away .
they call us for our fierceness english dogs , now , like to whelps , we crying run away .
a short alarum hark , countrymen !
either renew the fight , or tear the lions out of england coat , renounce your soil , give sheep in lions ' stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf , or horse or oxen from the leopard , as you fly from your slaves .

of all exploits since first i follow arms , heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this .
i think this talbot be a fiend of hell .
if not of hell , the heavens , sure , favour him .
here cometh charles i marvel how he sped .
tut , holy joan was his defensive guard .
enter charles and joan la pucelle is this thy cunning , thou deceitful dame ?
didst thou at first , to flatter us withal , make us partakers of a little gain , that now our loss might be ten times so much ?
wherefore is charles impatient with his friend !
at all times will you have my power alike ?
sleeping or waking must i still prevail , or will you blame and lay the fault on me ?
improvident soldiers !
had your watch been good , this sudden mischief never could have .
duke of alencon , this was your default , that , being captain of the watch , did look no better to that weighty charge .
had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government , we had not been thus shamefully surprised .
mine was secure .
and so was mine , my lord .
and , for myself , most part of all this night , within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employ in passing to and fro , about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in ?
question , my lords , no further of the case , how or which way is sure they found some place but weakly guarded , where the breach was made .
and now there rests no other shift but this , to gather our soldiers , scatter and dispersed , and lay new platforms to endamage them .
alarum .
enter an english soldier , crying ' a talbot !
a talbot ! '
they fly , leaving their clothes behind i be so bold to take what they have left .
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword , for i have loaden me with many spoils , using no other weapon but his name .

enter talbot , bedford , burgundy , a captain , and others the day begins to break , and night is fled , whose pitchy mantle the earth .
here sound retreat , and cease our hot pursuit .
retreat sounded bring forth the body of old salisbury , and here advance it in the , the middle centre of this cursed town .
now have i paid my vow unto his soul , for every drop of blood was drawn from him , there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight .
and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happen in revenge of him , within their chiefest temple i erect a tomb , wherein his corpse shall be interr upon the which , that every one may read , shall be engraved the sack of orleans , the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france .
but , lords , in all our bloody massacre , i muse we met not with the dauphin grace , his champion , virtuous joan of arc , nor any of his false confederates .
is thought , lord talbot , when the fight began , roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds , they did amongst the troops of armed men leap the walls for refuge in the field .
myself , as far as i could well discern for smoke and dusky vapours of the night , am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull , when arm in arm they both came swiftly running , like to a pair of loving that could not live asunder day or night .
after that things are set in order here , we follow them with all the power we have .
enter a messenger all hail , my lords !
which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot , for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france ?
here is the talbot who would speak with him ?
the virtuous lady , countess of auvergne , with modesty admiring thy renown , by me entreats , great lord , thou wouldst vouchsafe to visit her poor castle where she lies , that she may boast she hath beheld the man whose glory fills the world with loud report .
is it even so ?
nay , then , i see our wars will turn unto a peaceful comic sport , when ladies crave to be encounter with .
you may not , my lord , despise her gentle suit .
trust me then , for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory , yet hath a woman kindness and therefore tell her i return great thanks , and in submission will attend on her .
will not your honours bear me company ?
no , truly , it is more than manners will and i have heard it said , unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone .
well then , alone , since there no remedy , i mean to prove this lady courtesy .
come hither , captain .
whispers you perceive my mind ?
i do , my lord , and mean accordingly .

madam , i will .
exit countess the plot is laid if all things fall out right , i shall as famous be by this exploit as scythian tomyris by cyrus ' death .
great is the rumor of this dreadful knight , and his achievements of no less account fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears , to give their censure of these rare reports .
enter messenger and talbot madam , according as your ladyship desired , by message craved , so is lord talbot come .
countess and he is welcome .
what !
is this the man ?
madam , it is .
countess is this the scourge of france ?
is this the talbot , so much fear abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes ?
i see report is fabulous and false i thought i should have seen some hercules , a second hector , for his grim aspect , and large proportion of his limbs .
alas , this is a child , a silly dwarf !
it can not be this weak and writhled shrimp should strike such terror to his enemies .
madam , i have been bold to trouble you , but since your ladyship is not at leisure , i sort some other time to visit you .
countess what means he now ?
go ask him whither he goes .
stay , my lord talbot , for my lady craves to know the cause of your abrupt departure .
marry , for that she in a wrong belief , i go to certify her talbot here .
porter with keys countess if thou be he , then art thou prisoner .
prisoner !
to whom ?
countess to me , lord , and for that cause i trained thee to my house .
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me , for in my gallery thy picture hangs but now the substance shall endure the like , and i will chain these legs and arms of thine , that hast by tyranny these many years wasted our country , slain our citizens and sent our sons and husbands captivate .
ha , ha , ha !
countess laughest thou , wretch ?
thy mirth shall turn to moan .
i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot shadow whereon to practise your severity .
countess why , art not thou the man ?
i am indeed .
countess then have i substance too .
no , no , i am but shadow of myself you are deceived , my substance is not here , for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you , madam , were the whole frame here , it is of such a spacious lofty pitch , your roof were not sufficient to contai .
countess this is a riddling merchant for the nonce , he will be here , and yet he is not here how can these contrarieties agree ?
that will i show you presently .
winds his horn .
drums strike up a peal of ordnance .
enter soldiers how say you , madam ?
are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself ?
these are his substance , sinews , arms and strength , with which he yoketh your rebellious necks , razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate .
countess victorious talbot !
pardon my abuse i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited and more than may be gather by thy shape .
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath , for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art .
be not dismay , fair lady , nor misconstrue the mind of talbot , as you did mistake the outward composition of his body .
what you have done hath not offended me , nor other satisfaction do i crave , but only , with your patience , that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have , for soldiers ' stomachs always serve them well .
countess with all my heart , and think me honoured to feast so great a warrior in my house .

enter the earls of somerset , suffolk , and warwick , richard plantagenet , vernon , and another lawyer richard great lords and gentlemen , what means this silence ?
dare no man answer in a case of truth ?
within the we were too loud , the garden here is more convenient .
richard then say at once if i maintain the truth , or else was wrangling somerset in the error ?
faith , i have been a truant in the law , and never yet could frame my will to it , and therefore frame the law unto my will .
judge you , my lord of warwick , then , between us .
between two hawks , which flies the higher pitch , between two dogs , which hath the deeper mouth , between two blades , which bears the better temper between two horses , which doth bear him best , between two girls , which hath the merriest eye , i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement , but in these nice sharp quillets of the law , good faith , i am no wiser than a daw .
richard tut , tut , here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out .
and on my side it is so well apparell , so clear , so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind man eye .
richard since you are and so loath to speak , in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth , if he suppose that i have pleaded truth , from off this brier pluck a white rose with me .
let him that is no coward nor no flatterer , but dare maintain the party of the truth , pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me .
i love no colours , and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet .
i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right .
stay , lords and gentlemen , and pluck no more , till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are cropp from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion .
good master vernon , it is well objected if i have fewest , i subscribe in silence .
richard and i .
then for the truth and plainness of the case .
i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here , giving my verdict on the white rose side .
prick not your finger as you pluck it off , lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so , against your will .
if i my lord , for my opinion bleed , opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am .
well , well , come on who else ?
unless my study and my books be false , the argument you held was wrong in you to somerset in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too .
richard now , somerset , where is your argument ?
here in my scabbard , meditating that shall dye your white rose in a bloody red .
richard meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses , for pale they look with fear , as witnessing the truth on our side .
no , plantagenet , is not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses , and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error .
richard hath not thy rose a canker , somerset ?
hath not thy rose a thorn , plantagenet ?
richard ay , sharp and piercing , to maintain his truth , whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood .
well , i find friends to wear my bleeding roses , that shall maintain what i have said is true , where false plantagenet dare not be seen .
richard now , by this maiden blossom in my hand , i scorn thee and thy fashion , peevish boy .
turn not thy scorns this way , plantagenet .
richard proud pole , i will , and scorn both him and thee .
i turn my part thereof into thy throat .
away , away , good william de la pole !
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him .
now , by god will , thou him , somerset , his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence , third son to the third edward king of england spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root ?
richard he bears him on the place privilege , or durst not , for his craven heart , say thus .
by him that made me , i maintain my words on any plot of ground in christendom .
was not thy father , richard earl of cambridge , for treason executed in our late king days ?
and , by his treason , not thou attainted , corrupted , and exempt from ancient gentry ?
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood , and , till thou be restored , thou art a yeoman .
richard my father was attached , not attainted , condemn to die for treason , but no traitor , and that i prove on better men than somerset , were growing time once ripen to my will .
for your partaker pole and you yourself , i note you in my book of memory , to scourge you for this apprehension look to it well and say you are well warn .
ah , thou shalt find us ready for thee still , and know us by these colours for thy foes , for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear .
richard and , by my soul , this pale and angry rose , as cognizance of my hate , will i for ever and my faction wear , until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree .
go forward and be choked with thy ambition !
and so farewell until i meet thee next .
exit have with thee , pole .
farewell , ambitious richard .
exit richard how i am braved and must perforce endure it !
this blot that they object against your house shall be wiped out in the next parliament call for the truce of winchester and gloucester , and if thou be not then created york , i will not live to be accounted warwick .
meantime , in signal of my love to thee , against proud somerset and william pole , will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl , grown to this faction in the , shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night .
richard good master vernon , i am bound to you , that you on my behalf would pluck a flower .
in your behalf still will i wear the same .
and so will i .
richard thanks , gentle sir .
come , let us four to dinner i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day .
exeunt scene the tower of london .
enter mortimer , brought in a chair , and gaolers kind keepers of my weak decaying age , let dying mortimer here rest himself .
even like a man new haled from the rack , so fare my limbs with long imprisonment .
and these grey locks , the pursuivants of death , aged in an age of care , argue the end of edmund mortimer .
these eyes , like lamps whose wasting oil is spent , wax dim , as drawing to their exigent , weak shoulders , overborne with burthening grief , and pithless arms , like to a wither vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground , yet are these feet , whose strengthless stay is numb , unable to support this lump of clay , with desire to get a grave , as witting i no other comfort have .
but tell me , keeper , will my nephew come ?
richard plantagenet , my lord , will come we sent unto the temple , unto his chamber , and answer was return that he will come .
enough my soul shall then be satisfied .
poor gentleman !
his wrong doth equal mine .
since henry monmouth first began to reign , before whose glory i was great in arms , this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured , deprived of honour and inheritance .
but now the arbitrator of despairs , just death , kind umpire of men miseries , with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired , that so he might recover what was lost .
enter richard plantagenet my lord , your loving nephew now is come .
richard plantagenet , my friend , is he come ?
richard ay , noble uncle , thus ignobly used , your nephew , late despised richard , comes .
direct mine arms i may embrace his neck , and in his bosom spend my latter gasp o , tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks , that i may kindly give one fainting kiss .
and now declare , sweet stem from york great stock , why didst thou say , of late thou wert despised ?
richard first , lean thine aged back against mine arm , and , in that ease , i tell thee my disease .
this day , in argument upon a case , some words there grew somerset and me , among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my father death which obloquy set bars before my tongue , else with the like i had requited him .
therefore , good uncle , for my father sake , in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake , declare the cause my father , earl of cambridge , lost his head .
that cause , fair nephew , that imprison me and hath detain me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon , there to pine , was cursed instrument of his decease .
richard discover more at large what cause that was , for i am ignorant and can not guess .
i will , if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done .
henry the fourth , grandfather to this king , deposed his nephew richard , edward son , the and the lawful heir , of edward king , the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north , finding his usurpation most unjust , endeavor my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was , for that young king richard thus removed , leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage , for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence , the third son to king edward the third , whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree , being but fourth of that heroic line .
but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir , i lost my liberty and they their lives .
long after this , when henry the fifth , succeeding his father bolingbroke , did reign , thy father , earl of cambridge , then derived from famous edmund langley , duke of york , marrying my sister that thy mother was , again in pity of my hard distress levied an army , weening to redeem and have install me in the diadem but , as the rest , so fell that noble earl and was beheaded .
thus the mortimers , in whom the tide rested , were suppress .
richard of which , my lord , your honour is the last .
true , and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death , thou art my heir , the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care .
richard thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet , methinks , my father execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny .
with silence , nephew , be thou politic is the house of lancaster , and like a mountain , not to be removed .
but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts , when they are cloy with long continuance in a settled place .
richard o , uncle , would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age !
thou dost then wrong me , as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill .
mourn not , except thou sorrow for my good , only give order for my funeral and so farewell , and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war !
dies richard and peace , no war , befall thy parting soul !
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpass thy days .
well , i will lock his counsel in my breast , and what i do imagine let that rest .
keepers , convey him hence , and i myself will see his burial better than his life .
exeunt gaolers , bearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer , choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs , those bitter injuries , which somerset hath offer to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress , and therefore haste i to the parliament , either to be restored to my blood , or make my ill the advantage of my good .
