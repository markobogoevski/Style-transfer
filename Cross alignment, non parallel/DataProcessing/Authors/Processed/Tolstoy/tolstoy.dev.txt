anna arkadyevna , a waltz ?
he said , bending down to her .
why , have you met ?
inquired their host .
is there anyone we have not met ?
my wife and i are like white knows us , answered korsunsky .
a waltz , anna arkadyevna ?
i don t dance when it s possible not to dance , she said .
but tonight it s impossible , answered korsunsky .
at that instant vronsky came up .
well , since it s impossible tonight , let us start , she said , not noticing vronsky s bow , and she hastily put her hand on korsunsky s shoulder .
what is she vexed with him about ?
thought kitty , discerning that anna had intentionally not responded to vronsky s bow .
vronsky went up to kitty reminding her of the first quadrille , and expressing his regret that he had not seen her all this time .
kitty gazed in admiration at anna waltzing , and listened to him .
she expected him to ask her for a waltz , but he did not , and she glanced wonderingly at him .
he flushed slightly , and hurriedly asked her to waltz , but he had only just put his arm round her waist and taken the first step when the music suddenly stopped .
kitty looked into his face , which was so close to her own , and long several years look , full of love , to which he made no response , cut her to the heart with an agony of shame .
!
pardon ! waltz !
waltz !
shouted korsunsky from the other side of the room , and seizing the first young lady he came across he began dancing himself .
vronsky and kitty waltzed several times round the room .
after the first waltz kitty went to her mother , and she had hardly time to say a few words to countess nordston when vronsky came up again for the first quadrille .
during the quadrille nothing of any significance was said there was disjointed talk between them of the korsunskys , husband and wife , whom he described very amusingly , as delightful children at forty , and of the future town theater ; and only once the conversation touched her to the quick , when he asked her about levin , whether he was here , and added that he liked him so much .
but kitty did not expect much from the quadrille .
she looked forward with a thrill at her heart to the mazurka .
she fancied that in the mazurka everything must be decided .
the fact that he did not during the quadrille ask her for the mazurka did not trouble her .
she felt sure she would dance the mazurka with him as she had done at former balls , and refused five young men , saying she was engaged for the mazurka .
the whole ball up to the last quadrille was for kitty an enchanted vision of delightful colors , sounds , and motions .
she only sat down when she felt too tired and begged for a rest .
but as she was dancing the last quadrille with one of the tiresome young men whom she could not refuse , she chanced to be with vronsky and anna .
she had not been near anna again since the beginning of the evening , and now again she saw her suddenly quite new and surprising .
she saw in her the signs of that excitement of success she knew so well in herself ; she saw that she was intoxicated with the delighted admiration she was exciting .
she knew that feeling and knew its signs , and saw them in anna ; saw the quivering , flashing light in her eyes , and the smile of happiness and excitement unconsciously playing on her lips , and the deliberate grace , precision , and lightness of her movements .
who ?
she asked herself .
all or one ?
and not assisting the harassed young man she was dancing with in the conversation , the thread of which he had lost and could not pick up again , she obeyed with external liveliness the peremptory shouts of korsunsky starting them all into the , and then into the , and at the same time she kept watch with a growing pang at her heart .
no , it s not the admiration of the crowd has intoxicated her , but the adoration of one .
and that one ?
can it be he ?
every time he spoke to anna the joyous light flashed into her eyes , and the smile of happiness curved her red lips .
she seemed to make an effort to control herself , to try not to show these signs of delight , but they came out on her face of themselves .
but what of him ?
kitty looked at him and was filled with terror .
what was pictured so clearly to kitty in the mirror of anna s face she saw in him .
what had become of his always resolute manner , and the carelessly serene expression of his face ?
now every time he turned to her , he bent his head , as though he would have fallen at her feet , and in his eyes there was nothing but humble submission and dread .
i would not offend you , his eyes seemed every time to be saying , but i want to save myself , and i don t know how .
on his face was a look such as kitty had never seen before .
they were speaking of common acquaintances , keeping up the most trivial conversation , but to kitty it seemed that every word they said was determining their fate and hers .
and strange it was that they were actually talking of how absurd ivan ivanovitch was with his french , and how the eletsky girl might have made a better match , yet these words had all the while consequence for them , and they were feeling just as kitty did .
the whole ball , the whole world , everything seemed lost in fog in kitty s soul .
nothing but the stern discipline of her supported her and forced her to do what was expected of her , that is , to dance , to answer questions , to talk , even to smile .
but before the mazurka , when they were beginning to rearrange the chairs and a few couples moved out of the smaller rooms into the big room , a moment of despair and horror came for kitty .
she had refused five partners , and now she was not dancing the mazurka .
she had not even a hope of being asked for it , because she was so successful in society that the idea would never occur to anyone that she had remained disengaged till now .
she would have to tell her mother she felt ill and go home , but she had not the strength to do this .
she felt crushed .
she went to the furthest end of the little drawing room and sank into a low chair .
her light , transparent skirts rose like a cloud about her slender waist ; one bare , thin , soft , girlish arm , hanging listlessly , was lost in the folds of her pink tunic ; in the other she held her fan , and with rapid , short strokes fanned her burning face .
but while she looked like a butterfly , clinging to a blade of grass , and just about to open its rainbow wings for fresh flight , her heart ached with a horrible despair .
but perhaps i am wrong , perhaps it was not so ?
and again she recalled all she had seen .
kitty , what is it ?
said countess nordston , stepping noiselessly over the carpet towards her .
i don t understand it .
kitty s lower lip began to quiver ; she got up quickly .
kitty , you re not dancing the mazurka ?
no , no , said kitty in a voice shaking with tears .
he asked her for the mazurka before me , said countess nordston , knowing kitty would understand who were he and her .
she said why , aren t you going to dance it with princess shtcherbatskaya ? oh , i don t care !
answered kitty .
no one but she herself understood her position ; no one knew that she had just refused the man whom perhaps she loved , and refused him because she had put her faith in another .
countess nordston found korsunsky , with whom she was to dance the mazurka , and told him to ask kitty .
kitty danced in the first couple , and luckily for her she had not to talk , because korsunsky was all the time running about directing the figure .
vronsky and anna sat almost opposite her .
she saw them with her eyes , and saw them , too , close by , when they met in the figures , and the more she saw of them the more convinced was she that her unhappiness was complete .
she saw that they felt themselves alone in that crowded room .
and on vronsky s face , always so firm and independent , she saw that look that had struck her , of bewilderment and humble submissiveness , like the expression of an intelligent dog when it has done wrong .
anna smiled , and her smile was reflected by him .
she grew thoughtful , and he became serious .
some supernatural force drew kitty s eyes to anna s face .
she was fascinating in her simple black dress , fascinating were her round arms with their bracelets , fascinating was her firm neck with its thread of pearls , fascinating the straying curls of her loose hair , fascinating the graceful , light movements of her little feet and hands , fascinating was that lovely face in its eagerness , but there was something terrible and cruel in her fascination .
kitty admired her more than ever , and more and more acute was her suffering .
kitty felt overwhelmed , and her face showed it .
when vronsky saw her , coming across her in the mazurka , he did not at once recognize her , she was so changed .
delightful ball !
he said to her , for the sake of saying something .
yes , she answered .
in the middle of the mazurka , repeating a complicated figure , newly invented by korsunsky , anna came forward into the center of the circle , chose two gentlemen , and summoned a lady and kitty .
kitty gazed at her in dismay as she went up .
anna looked at her with drooping eyelids , and smiled , pressing her hand .
but , noticing that kitty only responded to her smile by a look of despair and amazement , she turned away from her , and began gaily talking to the other lady .
yes , there is something uncanny , devilish and fascinating in her , kitty said to herself .
anna did not mean to stay to supper , but the master of the house began to press her to do so .
nonsense , anna arkadyevna , said korsunsky , drawing her bare arm under the sleeve of his dress coat , i ve such an idea for a !
un bijou ! and he moved gradually on , trying to draw her along with him .
their host smiled approvingly .
no , i am not going to stay , answered anna , smiling , but in spite of her smile , both korsunsky and the master of the house saw from her resolute tone that she would not stay .
no ; why , as it is , i have danced more at your ball in moscow than i have all the winter in petersburg , said anna , looking round at vronsky , who stood near her .
i must rest a little before my journey .
are you certainly going tomorrow then ?
asked vronsky .
yes , i suppose so , answered anna , as it were wondering at the boldness of his question ; but the irrepressible , quivering brilliance of her eyes and her smile set him on fire as she said it .
anna arkadyevna did not stay to supper , but went home .
yes , there is something in me hateful , repulsive , thought levin , as he came away from the shtcherbatskys , and walked in the direction of his brother s lodgings .
and i don t get on with other people .
pride , they say .
no , i have no pride .
if i had any pride , i should not have put myself in such a position .
and he pictured to himself vronsky , happy , , clever , and , certainly never placed in the awful position in which he had been that evening .
yes , she was bound to choose him .
so it had to be , and i can not complain of anyone or anything .
i am myself to blame .
what right had i to imagine she would care to join her life to mine ?
who am i and what am i ?
a nobody , not wanted by any one , nor of use to anybody .
and he recalled his brother nikolay , and dwelt with pleasure on the thought of him .
isn t he right that everything in the world is base and loathsome ?
and are we fair in our judgment of brother nikolay ?
of course , from the point of view of prokofy , seeing him in a torn cloak and tipsy , he s a despicable person .
but i know him differently .
i know his soul , and know that we are like him .
and i , instead of going to seek him out , went out to dinner , and came here .
levin walked up to a lamppost , read his brother s address , which was in his pocketbook , and called a sledge .
all the long way to his brother s , levin vividly recalled all the facts familiar to him of his brother nikolay s life .
he remembered how his brother , while at the university , and for a year afterwards , had , in spite of the jeers of his companions , lived like a monk , strictly observing all religious rites , services , and fasts , and avoiding every sort of pleasure , especially women .
and afterwards , how he had all at once broken out he had associated with the most horrible people , and rushed into the most senseless debauchery .
he remembered later the scandal over a boy , whom he had taken from the country to bring up , and , in a fit of rage , had so violently beaten that proceedings were brought against him for unlawfully wounding .
then he recalled the scandal with a sharper , to whom he had lost money , and given a promissory note , and against whom he had himself lodged a complaint , asserting that he had cheated him .
( this was the money sergey ivanovitch had paid . )
then he remembered how he had spent a night in the lockup for disorderly conduct in the street .
he remembered the shameful proceedings he had tried to get up against his brother sergey ivanovitch , accusing him of not having paid him his share of his mother s fortune , and the last scandal , when he had gone to a western province in an official capacity , and there had got into trouble for assaulting a village elder
it was all horribly disgusting , yet to levin it appeared not at all in the same disgusting light as it inevitably would to those who did not know nikolay , did not know all his story , did not know his heart .
levin remembered that when nikolay had been in the devout stage , the period of fasts and monks and church services , when he was seeking in religion a support and a curb for his passionate temperament , everyone , far from encouraging him , had jeered at him , and he , too , with the others .
they had teased him , called him noah and monk ; and , when he had broken out , no one had helped him , but everyone had turned away from him with horror and disgust .
levin felt that , in spite of all the ugliness of his life , his brother nikolay , in his soul , in the very depths of his soul , was no more in the wrong than the people who despised him .
he was not to blame for having been born with his unbridled temperament and his somehow limited intelligence .
but he had always wanted to be good .
i will tell him everything , without reserve , and i will make him speak without reserve , too , and i ll show him that i love him , and so understand him , levin resolved to himself , as , towards eleven o clock , he reached the hotel of which he had the address .
at the top , and , the porter answered levin s inquiry .
at home ?
sure to be at home .
the door of no .
was half open , and there came out into the streak of light thick fumes of cheap , poor tobacco , and the sound of a voice , unknown to levin ; but he knew at once that his brother was there ; he heard his cough .
as he went in the door , the unknown voice was saying it all depends with how much judgment and knowledge the thing s done .
konstantin levin looked in at the door , and saw that the speaker was a young man with an immense shock of hair , wearing a russian jerkin , and that a pockmarked woman in a woolen gown , without collar or cuffs , was sitting on the sofa .
his brother was not to be seen .
konstantin felt a sharp pang at his heart at the thought of the strange company in which his brother spent his life .
no one had heard him , and konstantin , taking off his galoshes , listened to what the gentleman in the jerkin was saying .
he was speaking of some enterprise .
well , the devil flay them , the privileged classes , his brother s voice responded , with a cough .
masha !
get us some supper and some wine if there s any left ; or else go and get some .
the woman rose , came out from behind the screen , and saw konstantin .
there s some gentleman , nikolay dmitrievitch , she said .
whom do you want ?
said the voice of nikolay levin , angrily .
it s i , answered konstantin levin , coming forward into the light .
who s ?
nikolay s voice said again , still more angrily .
he could be heard getting up hurriedly , stumbling against something , and levin saw , facing him in the doorway , the big , scared eyes , and the huge , thin , stooping figure of his brother , so familiar , and yet astonishing in its weirdness and sickliness .
he was even thinner than three years before , when konstantin levin had seen him last .
he was wearing a short coat , and his hands and big bones seemed huger than ever .
his hair had grown thinner , the same straight mustaches hid his lips , the same eyes gazed strangely and naively at his visitor .
ah , kostya !
he exclaimed suddenly , recognizing his brother , and his eyes lit up with joy .
but the same second he looked round at the young man , and gave the nervous jerk of his head and neck that konstantin knew so well , as if his neckband hurt him ; and a quite different expression , wild , suffering , and cruel , rested on his emaciated face .
i wrote to you and sergey ivanovitch both that i don t know you and don t want to know you .
what is it you want ?
he was not at all the same as konstantin had been fancying him .
the worst and most tiresome part of his character , what made all relations with him so difficult , had been forgotten by konstantin levin when he thought of him , and now , when he saw his face , and especially that nervous twitching of his head , he remembered it all .
i didn t want to see you for anything , he answered timidly .
i ve simply come to see you .
his brother s timidity obviously softened nikolay .
his lips twitched .
oh , so that s it ?
he said .
well , come in ; sit down .
like some supper ?
masha , bring supper for three .
no , stop a minute .
do you know who this is ?
he said , addressing his brother , and indicating the gentleman in the jerkin this is kritsky , my friend from kiev , a very remarkable man .
he s persecuted by the police , of course , because he s not a scoundrel .
and he looked round in the way he always did at everyone in the room .
seeing that the woman standing in the doorway was moving to go , he shouted to her , wait a minute , i said .
and with the inability to express himself , the incoherence that konstantin knew so well , he began , with another look round at everyone , to tell his brother kritsky s story how he had been expelled from the university for starting a benefit society for the poor students and sunday schools ; and how he had afterwards been a teacher in a peasant school , and how he had been driven out of that too , and had afterwards been condemned for something .
you re of the kiev university ?
said konstantin levin to kritsky , to break the awkward silence that followed .
yes , i was of kiev , kritsky replied angrily , his face darkening .
and this woman , nikolay levin interrupted him , pointing to her , is the partner of my life , marya nikolaevna .
i took her out of a bad house , and he jerked his neck saying this ; but i love her and respect her , and any one who wants to know me , he added , raising his voice and knitting his brows , i beg to love her and respect her .
she s just the same as my wife , just the same .
so now you know whom you ve to do with .
and if you think you re lowering yourself , well , here s the floor , there s the door .
and again his eyes traveled inquiringly over all of them .
why i should be lowering myself , i don t understand .
then , masha , tell them to bring supper ; three portions , spirits and wine no , wait a minute no , it doesn t matter go along .
so you see , pursued nikolay levin , painfully wrinkling his forehead and twitching .
it was obviously difficult for him to think of what to say and do .
here , do you see ?
he pointed to some sort of iron bars , fastened together with strings , lying in a corner of the room .
do you see that ?
that s the beginning of a new thing we re going into .
it s a productive association konstantin scarcely heard him .
he looked into his sickly , consumptive face , and he was more and more sorry for him , and he could not force himself to listen to what his brother was telling him about the association .
he saw that this association was a mere anchor to save him from .
nikolay levin went on talking you know that capital oppresses the laborer .
the laborers with us , the peasants , bear all the burden of labor , and are so placed that however much they work they can t escape from their position of beasts of burden .
all the profits of labor , on which they might improve their position , and gain leisure for themselves , and after that education , all the surplus values are taken from them by the capitalists .
and society s so constituted that the harder they work , the greater the profit of the merchants and landowners , while they stay beasts of burden to the end .
and that state of things must be changed , he finished up , and he looked questioningly at his brother .
yes , of course , said konstantin , looking at the patch of red that had come out on his brother s projecting cheek bones .
and so we re founding a locksmiths association , where all the production and profit and the chief instruments of production will be in common .
where is the association to be ?
asked konstantin levin .
in the village of vozdrem , kazan government .
but why in a village ?
in the villages , i think , there is plenty of work as it is .
why a locksmiths association in a village ?
why ?
because the peasants are just as much slaves as they ever were , and that s why you and sergey ivanovitch don t like people to try and get them out of their slavery , said nikolay levin , exasperated by the objection .
konstantin levin sighed , looking meanwhile about the cheerless and dirty room .
this sigh seemed to exasperate nikolay still more .
i know your and sergey ivanovitch s aristocratic views .
i know that he applies all the power of his intellect to justify existing evils .
no ; and what do you talk of sergey ivanovitch for ?
said levin , smiling .
sergey ivanovitch ?
i ll tell you what for !
nikolay levin shrieked suddenly at the name of sergey ivanovitch .
i ll tell you what for
but what s the use of talking ?
there s only one thing what did you come to me for ?
you look down on this , and you re welcome to , go away , in god s name go away !
he shrieked , getting up from his chair .
and go away , and go away !
i don t look down on it at all , said konstantin levin timidly .
i don t even dispute it .
at that instant marya nikolaevna came back .
nikolay levin looked round angrily at her .
she went quickly to him , and whispered something .
i m not well ; i ve grown irritable , said nikolay levin , getting calmer and breathing painfully ; and then you talk to me of sergey ivanovitch and his article .
it s such rubbish , such lying , such .
what can a man write of justice who knows nothing of it ?
have you read his article ?
he asked kritsky , sitting down again at the table , and moving back off half of it the scattered cigarettes , so as to clear a space .
i ve not read it , kritsky responded gloomily , obviously not desiring to enter into the conversation .
why not ?
said nikolay levin , now turning with exasperation upon kritsky .
because i didn t see the use of wasting my time over it .
oh , but excuse me , how did you know it would be wasting your time ?
that article s too deep for many s to say it s over their heads .
but with me , it s another thing ; i see through his ideas , and i know where its weakness lies .
everyone was mute .
kritsky got up deliberately and reached his cap .
won t you have supper ?
all right , !
come round tomorrow with the locksmith .
kritsky had hardly gone out when nikolay levin smiled and winked .
he s no good either , he said .
i see , of course but at that instant kritsky , at the door , called him what do you want now ?
he said , and went out to him in the passage .
left alone with marya nikolaevna , levin turned to her .
have you been long with my brother ?
he said to her .
yes , more than a year .
nikolay dmitrievitch s health has become very poor .
nikolay dmitrievitch drinks a great deal , she said .
that is how does he drink ?
drinks vodka , and it s bad for him .
and a great deal ?
whispered levin .
yes , she said , looking timidly towards the doorway , where nikolay levin had reappeared .
what were you talking about ?
he said , knitting his brows , and turning his scared eyes from one to the other .
what was it ?
oh , nothing , konstantin answered in confusion .
oh , if you don t want to say , don t .
only it s no good your talking to her .
she s a wench , and you re a gentleman , he said with a jerk of the neck .
you understand everything , i see , and have taken stock of everything , and look with commiseration on my shortcomings , he began again , raising his voice .
nikolay dmitrievitch , nikolay dmitrievitch , whispered marya nikolaevna , again going up to him .
oh , very well , very well !
but where s the supper ?
ah , here it is , he said , seeing a waiter with a tray .
here , set it here , he added angrily , and promptly seizing the vodka , he poured out a glassful and drank it greedily .
like a drink ?
he turned to his brother , and at once became better humored .
well , enough of sergey ivanovitch .
i m glad to see you , anyway .
after all s said and done , we re not strangers .
come , have a drink .
tell me what you re doing , he went on , greedily munching a piece of bread , and pouring out another glassful .
how are you living ?
i live alone in the country , as i used to .
