i m busy looking after the land , answered konstantin , watching with horror the greediness with which his brother ate and drank , and trying to conceal that he noticed it .
why don t you get married ?
it hasn t happened so , konstantin answered , reddening a little .
why not ?
for me now everything s at an end !
i ve made a mess of my life .
but this i ve said , and i say still , that if my share had been given me when i needed it , my whole life would have been different .
konstantin made haste to change the conversation .
do you know your little vanya s with me , a clerk in the countinghouse at pokrovskoe .
nikolay jerked his neck , and sank into thought .
yes , tell me what s going on at pokrovskoe .
is the house standing still , and the birch trees , and our schoolroom ?
and philip the gardener , is he living ?
how i remember the arbor and the seat !
now mind and don t alter anything in the house , but make haste and get married , and make everything as it used to be again .
then i ll come and see you , if your wife is nice .
but come to me now , said levin .
how nicely we would arrange it !
i d come and see you if i were sure i should not find sergey ivanovitch .
you wouldn t find him there .
i live quite independently of him .
yes , but say what you like , you will have to choose between me and him , he said , looking timidly into his brother s face .
this timidity touched konstantin .
if you want to hear my confession of faith on the subject , i tell you that in your quarrel with sergey ivanovitch i take neither side .
you re both wrong .
you re more wrong externally , and he inwardly .
ah , ah !
you see that , you see that !
nikolay shouted joyfully .
but i personally value friendly relations with you more because why , why ?
konstantin could not say that he valued it more because nikolay was unhappy , and needed affection .
but nikolay knew that this was just what he meant to say , and scowling he took up the vodka again .
enough , nikolay dmitrievitch !
said marya nikolaevna , stretching out her plump , bare arm towards the decanter .
let it be !
don t insist !
i ll beat you !
he shouted .
marya nikolaevna smiled a sweet and smile , which was at once reflected on nikolay s face , and she took the bottle .
and do you suppose she understands nothing ?
said nikolay .
she understands it all better than any of us .
isn t it true there s something good and sweet in her ?
were you never before in moscow ?
konstantin said to her , for the sake of saying something .
only you mustn t be polite and stiff with her .
it frightens her .
no one ever spoke to her so but the justices of the peace who tried her for trying to get out of a house of .
mercy on us , the senselessness in the world !
he cried suddenly .
these new institutions , these justices of the peace , rural councils , what hideousness it all is !
and he began to enlarge on his encounters with the new institutions .
konstantin levin heard him , and the disbelief in the sense of all public institutions , which he shared with him , and often expressed , was distasteful to him now from his brother s lips .
in another world we shall understand it all , he said lightly .
in another world !
ah , i don t like that other world !
i don t like it , he said , letting his scared eyes rest on his brother s eyes .
here one would think that to get out of all the baseness and the mess , one s own and other people s , would be a good thing , and yet i m afraid of death , awfully afraid of death .
he shuddered .
but do drink something .
would you like some champagne ?
or shall we go somewhere ?
let s go to the gypsies !
do you know i have got so fond of the gypsies and russian songs .
his speech had begun to falter , and he passed abruptly from one subject to another .
konstantin with the help of masha persuaded him not to go out anywhere , and got him to bed hopelessly drunk .
masha promised to write to konstantin in case of need , and to persuade nikolay levin to go and stay with his brother .
in the morning konstantin levin left moscow , and towards evening he reached home .
on the journey in the train he talked to his neighbors about politics and the new railways , and , just as in moscow , he was overcome by a sense of confusion of ideas , dissatisfaction with himself , shame of something or other .
but when he got out at his own station , when he saw his coachman , ignat , with the collar of his coat turned up ; when , in the dim light reflected by the station fires , he saw his own sledge , his own horses with their tails tied up , in their harness trimmed with rings and tassels ; when the coachman ignat , as he put in his luggage , told him the village news , that the contractor had arrived , and that pava had calved , felt that little by little the confusion was clearing up , and the shame and were passing away .
he felt this at the mere sight of ignat and the horses ; but when he had put on the sheepskin brought for him , had sat down wrapped up in the sledge , and had driven off pondering on the work that lay before him in the village , and staring at the , that had been his , past his prime now , but a spirited beast from the don , he began to see what had happened to him in quite a different light .
he felt himself , and did not want to be any one else .
all he wanted now was to be better than before .
in the first place he resolved that from that day he would give up hoping for any extraordinary happiness , such as marriage must have given him , and consequently he would not so disdain what he really had .
secondly , he would never again let himself give way to low passion , the memory of which had so tortured him when he had been making up his mind to make an offer .
then remembering his brother nikolay , he resolved to himself that he would never allow himself to forget him , that he would follow him up , and not lose sight of him , so as to be ready to help when things should go ill with him .
and that would be soon , he felt .
then , too , his brother s talk of communism , which he had treated so lightly at the time , now made him think .
he considered a revolution in economic conditions nonsense .
but he always felt the injustice of his own abundance in comparison with the poverty of the peasants , and now he determined that so as to feel quite in the right , though he had worked hard and lived by no means luxuriously before , he would now work still harder , and would allow himself even less luxury .
and all this seemed to him so easy a conquest over himself that he spent the whole drive in the pleasantest daydreams .
with a resolute feeling of hope in a new , better life , he reached home before nine o clock at night .
the snow of the little quadrangle before the house was lit up by a light in the bedroom windows of his old nurse , agafea mihalovna , who performed the duties of housekeeper in his house .
she was not yet asleep .
kouzma , waked up by her , came sidling sleepily out onto the steps .
a setter bitch , laska , ran out too , almost upsetting kouzma , and whining , turned round about levin s knees , jumping up and longing , but not daring , to put her forepaws on his chest .
you re soon back again , sir , said agafea mihalovna .
i got tired of it , agafea mihalovna .
with friends , one is well ; but at home , one is better , he answered , and went into his study .
the study was slowly lit up as the candle was brought in .
the familiar details came out the stag s horns , the bookshelves , the , the stove with its ventilator , which had long wanted mending , his father s sofa , a large table , on the table an open book , a broken ash tray , a manuscript book with his handwriting .
as he saw all this , there came over him for an instant a doubt of the possibility of arranging the new life , of which he had been dreaming on the road .
all these traces of his life seemed to clutch him , and to say to him no , you re not going to get away from us , and you re not going to be different , but you re going to be the same as you ve always been ; with doubts , everlasting dissatisfaction with yourself , vain efforts to amend , and falls , and everlasting expectation , of a happiness which you won t get , and which isn t possible for you .
this the things said to him , but another voice in his heart was telling him that he must not fall under the sway of the past , and that one can do anything with oneself .
and hearing that voice , he went into the corner where stood his two heavy dumbbells , and began brandishing them like a gymnast , trying to restore his confident temper .
there was a creak of steps at the door .
he hastily put down the dumbbells .
the bailiff came in , and said everything , thank god , was doing well ; but informed him that the buckwheat in the new drying machine had been a little scorched .
this piece of news irritated levin .
the new drying machine had been constructed and partly invented by levin .
the bailiff had always been against the drying machine , and now it was with suppressed triumph that he announced that the buckwheat had been scorched .
levin was firmly convinced that if the buckwheat had been scorched , it was only because the precautions had not been taken , for which he had hundreds of times given orders .
he was annoyed , and reprimanded the bailiff .
but there had been an important and joyful event pava , his best cow , an expensive beast , bought at a show , had calved .
kouzma , give me my sheepskin .
and you tell them to take a lantern .
i ll come and look at her , he said to the bailiff .
the cowhouse for the more valuable cows was just behind the house .
walking across the yard , passing a snowdrift by the lilac tree , he went into the cowhouse .
there was the warm , steamy smell of dung when the frozen door was opened , and the cows , astonished at the unfamiliar light of the lantern , stirred on the fresh straw .
he caught a glimpse of the broad , smooth , black and piebald back of hollandka .
berkoot , the bull , was lying down with his ring in his lip , and seemed about to get up , but thought better of it , and only gave two snorts as they passed by him .
pava , a perfect beauty , huge as a hippopotamus , with her back turned to them , prevented their seeing the calf , as she sniffed her all over .
levin went into the pen , looked pava over , and lifted the red and spotted calf onto her long , tottering legs .
pava , uneasy , began lowing , but when levin put the calf close to her she was soothed , and , sighing heavily , began licking her with her rough tongue .
the calf , fumbling , poked her nose under her mother s udder , and stiffened her tail out straight .
here , bring the light , fyodor , this way , said levin , examining the calf .
like the mother !
though the color takes after the father ; but that s nothing .
very good .
long and broad in the haunch .
vassily fedorovitch , isn t she splendid ?
he said to the bailiff , quite forgiving him for the buckwheat under the influence of his delight in the calf .
how could she fail to be ?
oh , semyon the contractor came the day after you left .
you must settle with him , konstantin dmitrievitch , said the bailiff .
i did inform you about the machine .
this question was enough to take levin back to all the details of his work on the estate , which was on a large scale , and complicated .
he went straight from the cowhouse to the counting house , and after a little conversation with the bailiff and semyon the contractor , he went back to the house and straight upstairs to the drawing room .
the house was big and , and levin , though he lived alone , had the whole house heated and used .
he knew that this was stupid , he knew that it was positively not right , and contrary to his present new plans , but this house was a whole world to levin .
it was the world in which his father and mother had lived and died .
they had lived just the life that to levin seemed the ideal of perfection , and that he had dreamed of beginning with his wife , his family .
levin scarcely remembered his mother .
his conception of her was for him a sacred memory , and his future wife was bound to be in his imagination a repetition of that exquisite , holy ideal of a woman that his mother had been .
he was so far from conceiving of love for woman apart from marriage that he positively pictured to himself first the family , and only secondarily the woman who would give him a family .
his ideas of marriage were , consequently , quite unlike those of the great majority of his acquaintances , for whom getting married was one of the numerous facts of social life .
for levin it was the chief affair of life , on which its whole happiness turned .
and now he had to give up that .
when he had gone into the little drawing room , where he always had tea , and had settled himself in his armchair with a book , and agafea mihalovna had brought him tea , and with her usual , well , i ll stay a while , sir , had taken a chair in the window , he felt that , however strange it might be , he had not parted from his daydreams , and that he could not live without them .
whether with her , or with another , still it would be .
he was reading a book , and thinking of what he was reading , and stopping to listen to agafea mihalovna , who gossiped away without flagging , and yet with all that , all sorts of pictures of family life and work in the future rose disconnectedly before his imagination .
he felt that in the depth of his soul something had been put in its place , settled down , and laid to rest .
he heard agafea mihalovna talking of how prohor had forgotten his duty to god , and with the money levin had given him to buy a horse , had been drinking without stopping , and had beaten his wife till he d half killed her .
he listened , and read his book , and recalled the whole train of ideas suggested by his reading .
it was tyndall s on .
he recalled his own criticisms of tyndall of his complacent satisfaction in the cleverness of his experiments , and for his lack of philosophic insight .
and suddenly there floated into his mind the joyful thought in two years time i shall have two dutch cows ; pava herself will perhaps still be alive , a dozen young daughters of berkoot and the three lovely !
he took up his book again .
very good , electricity and heat are the same thing ; but is it possible to substitute the one quantity for the other in the equation for the solution of any problem ?
no .
well , then what of it ?
the connection between all the forces of nature is felt instinctively it s particulary nice if pava s daughter should be a cow , and all the herd will take after her , and the other three , too !
splendid !
to go out with my wife and visitors to meet the herd my wife says , kostya and i looked after that calf like a how can it interest you so much ? says a visitor .
everything that interests him , interests but who will she be ?
and he remembered what had happened at moscow well , there s nothing to be done it s not my fault .
but now everything shall go on in a new way .
it s nonsense to pretend that life won t let one , that the past won t let one .
one must struggle to live better , much better .
he raised his head , and fell to dreaming .
old laska , who had not yet fully digested her delight at his return , and had run out into the yard to bark , came back wagging her tail , and crept up to him , bringing in the scent of fresh air , put her head under his hand , and whined plaintively , asking to be stroked .
there , who d have thought it ?
said agafea mihalovna .
the dog now why , she understands that her master s come home , and that he s .
why ?
do you suppose i don t see it , sir ?
it s high time i should know the gentry .
why , i ve grown up from a little thing with them .
it s nothing , sir , so long as there s health and a clear conscience .
levin looked intently at her , surprised at how well she knew his thought .
shall i fetch you another cup ?
said she , and taking his cup she went out .
laska kept poking her head under his hand .
he stroked her , and she promptly curled up at his feet , laying her head on a hindpaw .
and in token of all now being well and satisfactory , she opened her mouth a little , smacked her lips , and settling her sticky lips more comfortably about her old teeth , she sank into blissful repose .
levin watched all her movements attentively .
that s what i ll do , he said to himself ; that s what i ll do !
nothing s amiss all s well .
after the ball , early next morning , anna arkadyevna sent her husband a telegram that she was leaving moscow the same day .
no , i must go , i must go ; she explained to her the change in her plans in a tone that suggested that she had to remember so many things that there was no enumerating them no , it had really better be today !
stepan arkadyevitch was not dining at home , but he promised to come and see his sister off at seven o clock .
kitty , too , did not come , sending a note that she had a headache .
dolly and anna dined alone with the children and the english governess .
whether it was that the children were fickle , or that they had acute senses , and felt that anna was quite different that day from what she had been when they had taken such a fancy to her , that she was not now interested in them , they had abruptly dropped their play with their aunt , and their love for her , and were quite indifferent that she was going away .
anna was absorbed the whole morning in preparations for her departure .
she wrote notes to her moscow acquaintances , put down her accounts , and packed .
altogether dolly fancied she was not in a placid state of mind , but in that worried mood , which dolly knew well with herself , and which does not come without cause , and for the most part covers dissatisfaction with self .
after dinner , anna went up to her room to dress , and dolly followed her .
how queer you are today !
dolly said to her .
i ?
do you think so ?
i m not queer , but i m nasty .
i am like that sometimes .
i keep feeling as if i could cry .
it s very stupid , but it ll pass off , said anna quickly , and she bent her flushed face over a tiny bag in which she was packing a nightcap and some cambric handkerchiefs .
her eyes were particularly bright , and were continually swimming with tears .
in the same way i didn t want to leave petersburg , and now i don t want to go away from here .
you came here and did a good deed , said dolly , looking intently at her .
anna looked at her with eyes wet with tears .
don t say that , dolly .
i ve done nothing , and could do nothing .
i often wonder why people are all in league to spoil me .
what have i done , and what could i do ?
in your heart there was found love enough to forgive if it had not been for you , god knows what would have happened !
how happy you are , anna !
said dolly .
everything is clear and good in your heart .
every heart has its own , as the english say .
you have no sort of , have you ?
everything is so clear in you .
i have !
said anna suddenly , and , unexpectedly after her tears , a sly , ironical smile curved her lips .
come , he s amusing , anyway , your , and not depressing , said dolly , smiling .
no , he s depressing .
do you know why i m going today instead of tomorrow ?
it s a confession that weighs on me ; i want to make it to you , said anna , letting herself drop definitely into an armchair , and looking straight into dolly s face .
and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears , up to the curly black ringlets on her neck .
yes , anna went on .
do you know why kitty didn t come to dinner ?
she s jealous of me .
i have spoiled i ve been the cause of that ball being a torture to her instead of a pleasure .
but truly , truly , it s not my fault , or only my fault a little bit , she said , daintily drawling the words a little bit .
oh , how like stiva you said that !
said dolly , laughing .
anna was hurt .
oh no , oh no !
i m not stiva , she said , knitting her brows .
that s why i m telling you , just because i could never let myself doubt myself for an instant , said anna .
but at the very moment she was uttering the words , she felt that they were not true .
she was not merely doubting herself , she felt emotion at the thought of vronsky , and was going away sooner than she had meant , simply to avoid meeting him .
yes , stiva told me you danced the mazurka with him , and that he you can t imagine how absurdly it all came about .
i only meant to be matchmaking , and all at once it turned out quite differently .
possibly against my own will she crimsoned and stopped .
oh , they feel it directly ?
said dolly .
but i should be in despair if there were anything serious in it on his side , anna interrupted her .
and i am certain it will all be forgotten , and kitty will leave off hating me .
all the same , anna , to tell you the truth , i m not very anxious for this marriage for kitty .
and it s better it should come to nothing , if he , vronsky , is capable of falling in love with you in a single day .
oh , heavens , that would be too silly !
said anna , and again a deep flush of pleasure came out on her face , when she heard the idea , that absorbed her , put into words .
and so here i am going away , having made an enemy of kitty , whom i liked so much !
ah , how sweet she is !
but you ll make it right , dolly ?
eh ?
dolly could scarcely suppress a smile .
she loved anna , but she enjoyed seeing that she too had her weaknesses .
an enemy ?
that can t be .
i did so want you all to care for me , as i do for you , and now i care for you more than ever , said anna , with tears in her eyes .
ah , how silly i am today !
she passed her handkerchief over her face and began dressing .
at the very moment of starting stepan arkadyevitch arrived , late , rosy and , smelling of wine and cigars .
anna s emotionalism infected dolly , and when she embraced her for the last time , she whispered remember , anna , what you ve done for shall never forget .
and remember that i love you , and shall always love you as my dearest friend !
i don t know why , said anna , kissing her and hiding her tears .
you understood me , and you understand .
, my darling !
come , it s all over , and thank god !
was the first thought that came to anna arkadyevna , when she had said for the last time to her brother , who had stood blocking up the entrance to the carriage till the third bell rang .
she sat down on her lounge beside annushka , and looked about her in the twilight of the .
thank god !
tomorrow i shall see seryozha and alexey alexandrovitch , and my life will go on in the old way , all nice and as usual .
still in the same anxious frame of mind , as she had been all that day , anna took pleasure in arranging herself for the journey with great care .
with her little deft hands she opened and shut her little red bag , took out a cushion , laid it on her knees , and carefully wrapping up her feet , settled herself comfortably .
an invalid lady had already lain down to sleep .
two other ladies began talking to anna , and a stout elderly lady tucked up her feet , and made observations about the heating of the train .
anna answered a few words , but not foreseeing any entertainment from the conversation , she asked annushka to get a lamp , hooked it onto the arm of her seat , and took from her bag a paper knife and an english novel .
at first her reading made no progress .
the fuss and bustle were disturbing ; then when the train had started , she could not help listening to the noises ; then the snow beating on the left window and sticking to the pane , and the sight of the muffled guard passing by , covered with snow on one side , and the conversations about the terrible snowstorm raging outside , distracted her attention .
farther on , it was continually the same again and again the same shaking and rattling , the same snow on the window , the same rapid transitions from steaming heat to cold , and back again to heat , the same passing glimpses of the same figures in the twilight , and the same voices , and anna began to read and to understand what she read .
annushka was already dozing , the red bag on her lap , clutched by her broad hands , in gloves , of which one was torn .
anna arkadyevna read and understood , but it was distasteful to her to read , that is , to follow the reflection of other people s lives .
she had too great a desire to live herself .
if she read that the heroine of the novel was nursing a sick man , she longed to move with noiseless steps about the room of a sick man ; if she read of a member of parliament making a speech , she longed to be delivering the speech ; if she read of how lady mary had ridden after the hounds , and had provoked her , and had surprised everyone by her boldness , she too wished to be doing the same .
but there was no chance of doing anything ; and twisting the smooth paper knife in her little hands , she forced herself to read .
the hero of the novel was already almost reaching his english happiness , a baronetcy and an estate , and anna was feeling a desire to go with him to the estate , when she suddenly felt that ought to feel ashamed , and that she was ashamed of the same thing .
but what had he to be ashamed of ?
what have i to be ashamed of ?
she asked herself in injured surprise .
she laid down the book and sank against the back of the chair , tightly gripping the paper cutter in both hands .
there was nothing .
she went over all her moscow recollections .
all were good , pleasant .
she remembered the ball , remembered vronsky and his face of slavish adoration , remembered all her conduct with him there was nothing shameful .
and for all that , at the same point in her memories , the feeling of shame was intensified , as though some inner voice , just at the point when she thought of vronsky , were saying to her , warm , very warm , hot .
well , what is it ?
she said to herself resolutely , shifting her seat in the lounge .
what does it mean ?
am i afraid to look it straight in the face ?
why , what is it ?
can it be that between me and this officer boy there exist , or can exist , any other relations than such as are common with every acquaintance ?
she laughed contemptuously and took up her book again ; but now she was definitely unable to follow what she read .
she passed the paper knife over the window pane , then laid its smooth , cool surface to her cheek , and almost laughed aloud at the feeling of delight that all at once without cause came over her .
she felt as though her nerves were strings being strained tighter and tighter on some sort of screwing peg .
she felt her eyes opening wider and wider , her fingers and toes twitching nervously , something within oppressing her breathing , while all shapes and sounds seemed in the uncertain to strike her with unaccustomed vividness .
moments of doubt were continually coming upon her , when she was uncertain whether the train were going forwards or backwards , or were standing still altogether ; whether it were annushka at her side or a stranger .
what s that on the arm of the chair , a fur cloak or some beast ?
and what am i myself ?
myself or some other woman ?
she was afraid of giving way to this delirium .
but something drew her towards it , and she could yield to it or resist it at will .
she got up to rouse herself , and slipped off her plaid and the cape of her warm dress .
for a moment she regained her , and realized that the thin peasant who had come in wearing a long overcoat , with buttons missing from it , was the stoveheater , that he was looking at the thermometer , that it was the wind and snow bursting in after him at the door ; but then everything grew blurred again that peasant with the long waist seemed to be gnawing something on the wall , the old lady began stretching her legs the whole length of the carriage , and filling it with a black cloud ; then there was a fearful shrieking and banging , as though someone were being torn to pieces ; then there was a blinding dazzle of red fire before her eyes and a wall seemed to rise up and hide everything .
anna felt as though she were sinking down .
but it was not terrible , but delightful .
the voice of a man muffled up and covered with snow shouted something in her ear .
she got up and pulled herself together ; she realized that they had reached a station and that this was the guard .
she asked annushka to hand her the cape she had taken off and her shawl , put them on and moved towards the door .
do you wish to get out ?
asked annushka .
yes , i want a little air .
it s very hot in here .
and she opened the door .
the driving snow and the wind rushed to meet her and struggled with her over the door .
but she enjoyed the struggle .
she opened the door and went out .
the wind seemed as though lying in wait for her ; with gleeful whistle it tried to snatch her up and bear her off , but she clung to the cold door post , and holding her skirt got down onto the platform and under the shelter of the carriages .
the wind had been powerful on the steps , but on the platform , under the lee of the carriages , there was a lull .
with enjoyment she drew deep breaths of the frozen , snowy air , and standing near the carriage looked about the platform and the lighted station .
the raging tempest rushed whistling between the wheels of the carriages , about the scaffolding , and round the corner of the station .
the carriages , posts , people , everything that was to be seen was covered with snow on one side , and was getting more and more thickly covered .
for a moment there would come a lull in the storm , but then it would swoop down again with such onslaughts that it seemed impossible to stand against it .
meanwhile men ran to and fro , talking merrily together , their steps crackling on the platform as they continually opened and closed the big doors .
the bent shadow of a man glided by at her feet , and she heard sounds of a hammer upon iron .
hand over that telegram !
came an angry voice out of the stormy darkness on the other side .
this way !
no .
!
several different voices shouted again , and muffled figures ran by covered with snow .
two gentlemen with lighted cigarettes passed by her .
she drew one more deep breath of the fresh air , and had just put her hand out of her muff to take hold of the door post and get back into the carriage , when another man in a military overcoat , quite close beside her , stepped between her and the flickering light of the lamp post .
she looked round , and the same instant recognized vronsky s face .
putting his hand to the peak of his cap , he bowed to her and asked , was there anything she wanted ?
could he be of any service to her ?
she gazed rather a long while at him without answering , and , in spite of the shadow in which he was standing , she saw , or fancied she saw , both the expression of his face and his eyes .
it was again that expression of reverential ecstasy which had so worked upon her the day before .
more than once she had told herself during the past few days , and again only a few moments before , that vronsky was for her only one of the hundreds of young men , forever exactly the same , that are met everywhere , that she would never allow herself to bestow a thought upon him .
but now at the first instant of meeting him , she was seized by a feeling of joyful pride .
she had no need to ask why he had come .
she knew as certainly as if he had told her that he was here to be where she was .
i didn t know you were going .
what are you coming for ?
she said , letting fall the hand with which she had grasped the door post .
and irrepressible delight and eagerness shone in her face .
what am i coming for ?
he repeated , looking straight into her eyes .
you know that i have come to be where you are , he said ; i can t help it .
at that moment the wind , as it were , surmounting all obstacles , sent the snow flying from the carriage roofs , and clanked some sheet of iron it had torn off , while the hoarse whistle of the engine roared in front , plaintively and gloomily .
all the awfulness of the storm seemed to her more splendid now .
he had said what her soul longed to hear , though she feared it with her reason .
she made no answer , and in her face he saw conflict .
forgive me , if you dislike what i said , he said humbly .
he had spoken courteously , deferentially , yet so firmly , so stubbornly , that for a long while she could make no answer .
it s wrong , what you say , and i beg you , if you re a good man , to forget what you ve said , as i forget it , she said at last .
not one word , not one gesture of yours shall i , could i , ever forget enough , enough !
she cried trying assiduously to give a stern expression to her face , into which he was gazing greedily .
and clutching at the cold door post , she clambered up the steps and got rapidly into the corridor of the carriage .
but in the little corridor she paused , going over in her imagination what had happened .
though she could not recall her own words or his , she realized instinctively that the momentary conversation had brought them fearfully closer ; and she was and blissful at it .
after standing still a few seconds , she went into the carriage and sat down in her place .
the overstrained condition which had tormented her before did not only come back , but was intensified , and reached such a pitch that she was afraid every minute that something would snap within her from the excessive tension .
she did not sleep all night .
but in that nervous tension , and in the visions that filled her imagination , there was nothing disagreeable or gloomy on the contrary there was something blissful , glowing , and exhilarating .
towards morning anna sank into a doze , sitting in her place , and when she waked it was daylight and the train was near petersburg .
at once thoughts of home , of husband and of son , and the details of that day and the following came upon her .
at petersburg , as soon as the train stopped and she got out , the first person that attracted her attention was her husband .
oh , mercy !
why do his ears look like that ?
she thought , looking at his frigid and imposing figure , and especially the ears that struck her at the moment as propping up the brim of his round hat .
catching sight of her , he came to meet her , his lips falling into their habitual sarcastic smile , and his big , tired eyes looking straight at her .
an unpleasant sensation gripped at her heart when she met his obstinate and weary glance , as though she had expected to see him different .
she was especially struck by the feeling of dissatisfaction with herself that she experienced on meeting him .
that feeling was an intimate , familiar feeling , like a consciousness of hypocrisy , which she experienced in her relations with her husband .
but hitherto she had not taken note of the feeling , now she was clearly and painfully aware of it .
yes , as you see , your tender spouse , as devoted as the first year after marriage , burned with impatience to see you , he said in his deliberate , voice , and in that tone which he almost always took with her , a tone of jeering at anyone who should say in earnest what he said .
is seryozha quite well ?
she asked .
and is this all the reward , said he , for my ardor ?
he s quite well vronsky had not even tried to sleep all that night .
he sat in his armchair , looking straight before him or scanning the people who got in and out .
if he had indeed on previous occasions struck and impressed people who did not know him by his air of unhesitating composure , he seemed now more haughty and than ever .
he looked at people as if they were things .
a nervous young man , a clerk in a law court , sitting opposite him , hated him for that look .
the young man asked him for a light , and entered into conversation with him , and even pushed against him , to make him feel that he was not a thing , but a person .
but vronsky gazed at him exactly as he did at the lamp , and the young man made a wry face , feeling that he was losing his under the oppression of this refusal to recognize him as a person .
vronsky saw nothing and no one .
he felt himself a king , not because he believed that he had made an impression on did not yet believe that , because the impression she had made on him gave him happiness and pride .
what would come of it all he did not know , he did not even think .
he felt that all his forces , hitherto dissipated , wasted , were centered on one thing , and bent with fearful energy on one blissful goal .
and he was happy at it .
he knew only that he had told her the truth , that he had come where she was , that all the happiness of his life , the only meaning in life for him , now lay in seeing and hearing her .
and when he got out of the carriage at bologova to get some seltzer water , and caught sight of anna , involuntarily his first word had told her just what he thought .
and he was glad he had told her it , that she knew it now and was thinking of it .
he did not sleep all night .
when he was back in the carriage , he kept unceasingly going over every position in which he had seen her , every word she had uttered , and before his fancy , making his heart faint with emotion , floated pictures of a possible future .
when he got out of the train at petersburg , he felt after his sleepless night as keen and fresh as after a cold bath .
he paused near his compartment , waiting for her to get out .
once more , he said to himself , smiling unconsciously , once more i shall see her walk , her face ; she will say something , turn her head , glance , smile , maybe .
but before he caught sight of her , he saw her husband , whom the was deferentially escorting through the crowd .
ah , yes !
the husband .
only now for the first time did vronsky realize clearly the fact that there was a person attached to her , a husband .
he knew that she had a husband , but had hardly believed in his existence , and only now fully believed in him , with his head and shoulders , and his legs clad in black trousers ; especially when he saw this husband calmly take her arm with a sense of property .
seeing alexey alexandrovitch with his petersburg face and severely figure , in his round hat , with his rather prominent spine , he believed in him , and was aware of a disagreeable sensation , such as a man might feel tortured by thirst , who , on reaching a spring , should find a dog , a sheep , or a pig , who has drunk of it and muddied the water .
alexey alexandrovitch s manner of walking , with a swing of the hips and flat feet , particularly annoyed vronsky .
he could recognize in no one but himself an indubitable right to love her .
but she was still the same , and the sight of her affected him the same way , physically reviving him , stirring him , and filling his soul with rapture .
he told his german valet , who ran up to him from the second class , to take his things and go on , and he himself went up to her .
he saw the first meeting between the husband and wife , and noted with a lover s insight the signs of slight reserve with which she spoke to her husband .
no , she does not love him and can not love him , he decided to himself .
at the moment when he was approaching anna arkadyevna he noticed too with joy that she was conscious of his being near , and looked round , and seeing him , turned again to her husband .
have you passed a good night ?
he asked , bowing to her and her husband together , and leaving it up to alexey alexandrovitch to accept the bow on his own account , and to recognize it or not , as he might see fit .
thank you , very good , she answered .
her face looked weary , and there was not that play of eagerness in it , peeping out in her smile and her eyes ; but for a single instant , as she glanced at him , there was a flash of something in her eyes , and although the flash died away at once , he was happy for that moment .
she glanced at her husband to find out whether he knew vronsky .
alexey alexandrovitch looked at vronsky with displeasure , vaguely recalling who this was .
vronsky s composure and here struck , like a scythe against a stone , upon the cold of alexey alexandrovitch .
count vronsky , said anna .
ah !
we are acquainted , i believe , said alexey alexandrovitch indifferently , giving his hand .
you set off with the mother and you return with the son , he said , articulating each syllable , as though each were a separate favor he was bestowing .
you re back from leave , i suppose ?
he said , and without waiting for a reply , he turned to his wife in his jesting tone well , were a great many tears shed at moscow at parting ?
by addressing his wife like this he gave vronsky to understand that he wished to be left alone , and , turning slightly towards him , he touched his hat ; but vronsky turned to anna arkadyevna .
i hope i may have the honor of calling on you , he said .
alexey alexandrovitch glanced with his weary eyes at vronsky .
delighted , he said coldly .
on mondays we re at home .
most fortunate , he said to his wife , dismissing vronsky altogether , that i should just have half an hour to meet you , so that i can prove my devotion , he went on in the same jesting tone .
you lay too much stress on your devotion for me to value it much , she responded in the same jesting tone , involuntarily listening to the sound of vronsky s steps behind them .
but what has it to do with me ?
she said to herself , and she began asking her husband how seryozha had got on without her .
oh , capitally !
mariette says he has been very good , and
i must disappoint you but he has not missed you as your husband has .
but once more , my dear , for giving me a day .
our dear will be delighted .
( he used to call the countess lidia ivanovna , well known in society , a samovar , because she was always bubbling over with excitement . )
she has been continually asking after you .
and , do you know , if i may venture to advise you , you should go and see her today .
you know how she takes everything to heart .
just now , with all her own cares , she s anxious about the oblonskys being brought together .
the countess lidia ivanovna was a friend of her husband s , and the center of that one of the coteries of the petersburg world with which anna was , through her husband , in the closest relations .
but you know i wrote to her ?
still she ll want to hear details .
go and see her , if you re not too tired , my dear .
well , kondraty will take you in the carriage , while i go to my committee .
i shall not be alone at dinner again , alexey alexandrovitch went on , no longer in a sarcastic tone .
you wouldn t believe how i ve missed and with a long pressure of her hand and a meaning smile , he put her in her carriage .
the first person to meet anna at home was her son .
he dashed down the stairs to her , in spite of the governess s call , and with desperate joy shrieked mother !
mother !
running up to her , he hung on her neck .
i told you it was mother !
he shouted to the governess .
i knew !
and her son , like her husband , aroused in anna a feeling akin to disappointment .
she had imagined him better than he was in reality .
she had to let herself drop down to the reality to enjoy him as he really was .
but even as he was , he was charming , with his fair curls , his blue eyes , and his plump , graceful little legs in tightly stockings .
anna experienced almost physical pleasure in the sensation of his nearness , and his caresses , and moral soothing , when she met his simple , confiding , and loving glance , and heard his naïve questions .
anna took out the presents dolly s children had sent him , and told her son what sort of little girl was tanya at moscow , and how tanya could read , and even taught the other children .
why , am i not so nice as she ?
asked seryozha .
to me you re nicer than anyone in the world .
i know that , said seryozha , smiling .
anna had not had time to drink her coffee when the countess lidia ivanovna was announced .
the countess lidia ivanovna was a tall , stout woman , with an unhealthily sallow face and splendid , pensive black eyes .
anna liked her , but today she seemed to be seeing her for the first time with all her defects .
well , my dear , so you took the olive branch ?
inquired countess lidia ivanovna , as soon as she came into the room .
yes , it s all over , but it was all much less serious than we had supposed , answered anna .
my is in general too hasty .
but countess lidia ivanovna , though she was interested in everything that did not concern her , had a habit of never listening to what interested her ; she interrupted anna yes , there s plenty of sorrow and evil in the world .
i am so worried today .
oh , why ?
asked anna , trying to suppress a smile .
i m beginning to be weary of fruitlessly championing the truth , and sometimes i m quite unhinged by it .
the society of the little sisters ( this was a , philanthropic institution ) was going splendidly , but with these gentlemen it s impossible to do anything , added countess lidia ivanovna in a tone of ironical submission to destiny .
they pounce on the idea , and distort it , and then work it out so pettily and unworthily .
two or three people , your husband among them , understand all the importance of the thing , but the others simply drag it down .
yesterday pravdin wrote to me pravdin was a panslavist abroad , and countess lidia ivanovna described the purport of his letter .
then the countess told her of more disagreements and intrigues against the work of the unification of the churches , and departed in haste , as she had that day to be at the meeting of some society and also at the slavonic committee .
it was all the same before , of course ; but why was it i didn t notice it before ?
anna asked herself .
or has she been very much irritated today ?
it s really ludicrous ; her object is doing good ; she a christian , yet she s always angry ; and she always has enemies , and always enemies in the name of christianity and doing good .
after countess lidia ivanovna another friend came , the wife of a chief secretary , who told her all the news of the town .
at three o clock she too went away , promising to come to dinner .
alexey alexandrovitch was at the ministry .
anna , left alone , spent the time till dinner in assisting at her son s dinner ( he dined apart from his parents ) and in putting her things in order , and in reading and answering the notes and letters which had accumulated on her table .
the feeling of causeless shame , which she had felt on the journey , and her excitement , too , had completely vanished .
in the habitual conditions of her life she felt again resolute and irreproachable .
she recalled with wonder her state of mind on the previous day .
what was it ?
nothing .
vronsky said something silly , which it was easy to put a stop to , and i answered as i ought to have done .
to speak of it to my husband would be unnecessary and out of the question .
to speak of it would be to attach importance to what has no importance .
she remembered how she had told her husband of what was almost a declaration made her at petersburg by a young man , one of her husband s subordinates , and how alexey alexandrovitch had answered that every woman living in the world was exposed to such incidents , but that he had the fullest confidence in her tact , and could never lower her and himself by jealousy .
so then there s no reason to speak of it ?
and indeed , thank god , there s nothing to speak of , she told herself .
alexey alexandrovitch came back from the meeting of the ministers at four o clock , but as often happened , he had not time to come in to her .
he went into his study to see the people waiting for him with petitions , and to sign some papers brought him by his chief secretary .
at dinner time ( there were always a few people dining with the karenins ) there arrived an old lady , a cousin of alexey alexandrovitch , the chief secretary of the department and his wife , and a young man who had been recommended to alexey alexandrovitch for the service .
anna went into the drawing room to receive these guests .
precisely at five o clock , before the bronze peter the first clock had struck the fifth stroke , alexey alexandrovitch came in , wearing a white tie and evening coat with two stars , as he had to go out directly after dinner .
every minute of alexey alexandrovitch s life was portioned out and occupied .
and to make time to get through all that lay before him every day , he adhered to the strictest punctuality .
unhasting and unresting , was his motto .
he came into the dining hall , greeted everyone , and hurriedly sat down , smiling to his wife .
yes , my solitude is over .
you wouldn t believe how uncomfortable ( he laid stress on the word ) it is to dine alone .
at dinner he talked a little to his wife about moscow matters , and , with a sarcastic smile , asked her after stepan arkadyevitch ; but the conversation was for the most part general , dealing with petersburg official and public news .
after dinner he spent half an hour with his guests , and again , with a smile , pressed his wife s hand , withdrew , and drove off to the council .
anna did not go out that evening either to the princess betsy tverskaya , who , hearing of her return , had invited her , nor to the theater , where she had a box for that evening .
she did not go out principally because the dress she had reckoned upon was not ready .
altogether , anna , on turning , after the departure of her guests , to the consideration of her attire , was very much annoyed .
she was generally a mistress of the art of dressing well without great expense , and before leaving moscow she had given her dressmaker three dresses to transform .
the dresses had to be altered so that they could not be recognized , and they ought to have been ready three days before .
it appeared that two dresses had not been done at all , while the other one had not been altered as anna had intended .
the dressmaker came to explain , declaring that it would be better as she had done it , and anna was so furious that she felt ashamed when she thought of it afterwards .
to regain her serenity completely she went into the nursery , and spent the whole evening with her son , put him to bed herself , signed him with the cross , and tucked him up .
she was glad she had not gone out anywhere , and had spent the evening so well .
she felt so and serene , she saw so clearly that all that had seemed to her so important on her railway journey was only one of the common trivial incidents of fashionable life , and that she had no reason to feel ashamed before anyone else or before herself .
anna sat down at the hearth with an english novel and waited for her husband .
exactly at nine she heard his ring , and he came into the room .
here you are at last !
she observed , holding out her hand to him .
he kissed her hand and sat down beside her .
altogether then , i see your visit was a success , he said to her .
oh , yes , she said , and she began telling him about everything from the beginning her journey with countess vronskaya , her arrival , the accident at the station .
then she described the pity she had felt , first for her brother , and afterwards for dolly .
i imagine one can not exonerate such a man from blame , though he is your brother , said alexey alexandrovitch severely .
anna smiled .
she knew that he said that simply to show that family considerations could not prevent him from expressing his genuine opinion .
she knew that characteristic in her husband , and liked it .
i am glad it has all ended so satisfactorily , and that you are back again , he went on .
come , what do they say about the new act i have got passed in the council ?
anna had heard nothing of this act , and she felt at having been able so readily to forget what was to him of such importance .
here , on the other hand , it has made a great sensation , he said , with a complacent smile .
she saw that alexey alexandrovitch wanted to tell her something pleasant to him about it , and she brought him by questions to telling it .
with the same complacent smile he told her of the ovations he had received in consequence of the act he had passed .
i was very , very glad .
it shows that at last a reasonable and steady view of the matter is becoming prevalent among us .
having drunk his second cup of tea with cream , and bread , alexey alexandrovitch got up , and was going towards his study .
and you ve not been anywhere this evening ?
you ve been dull , i expect ?
he said .
oh , no !
she answered , getting up after him and accompanying him across the room to his study .
what are you reading now ?
she asked .
just now i m reading duc de lille , des enfers , he answered .
a very remarkable book .
anna smiled , as people smile at the weaknesses of those they love , and , putting her hand under his , she escorted him to the door of the study .
she knew his habit , that had grown into a necessity , of reading in the evening .
she knew , too , that in spite of his official duties , which swallowed up almost the whole of his time , he considered it his duty to keep up with everything of note that appeared in the intellectual world .
she knew , too , that he was really interested in books dealing with politics , philosophy , and theology , that art was utterly foreign to his nature ; but , in spite of this , or rather , in consequence of it , alexey alexandrovitch never passed over anything in the world of art , but made it his duty to read everything .
she knew that in politics , in philosophy , in theology , alexey alexandrovitch often had doubts , and made investigations ; but on questions of art and poetry , and , above all , of music , of which he was totally devoid of understanding , he had the most distinct and decided opinions .
he was fond of talking about shakespeare , raphael , beethoven , of the significance of new schools of poetry and music , all of which were classified by him with very conspicuous consistency .
well , god be with you , she said at the door of the study , where a shaded candle and a decanter of water were already put by his armchair .
and i ll write to moscow .
he pressed her hand , and again kissed it .
all the same he s a good man ; truthful , , and remarkable in his own line , anna said to herself going back to her room , as though she were defending him to someone who had attacked him and said that one could not love him .
but why is it his ears stick out so strangely ?
or has he had his hair cut ?
precisely at twelve o clock , when anna was still sitting at her writing table , finishing a letter to dolly , she heard the sound of measured steps in slippers , and alexey alexandrovitch , freshly washed and combed , with a book under his arm , came in to her .
it s time , it s time , said he , with a meaning smile , and he went into their bedroom .
and what right had he to look at him like that ?
thought anna , recalling vronsky s glance at alexey alexandrovitch .
undressing , she went into the bedroom ; but her face had none of the eagerness which , during her stay in moscow , had fairly flashed from her eyes and her smile ; on the contrary , now the fire seemed quenched in her , hidden somewhere far away .
when vronsky went to moscow from petersburg , he had left his large set of rooms in morskaia to his friend and favorite comrade petritsky .
petritsky was a young lieutenant , not particularly , and not merely not wealthy , but always hopelessly in debt .
towards evening he was always drunk , and he had often been locked up after all sorts of ludicrous and disgraceful scandals , but he was a favorite both of his comrades and his superior officers .
on arriving at twelve o clock from the station at his flat , vronsky saw , at the outer door , a hired carriage familiar to him .
while still outside his own door , as he rang , he heard masculine laughter , the lisp of a feminine voice , and petritsky s voice .
if that s one of the villains , don t let him in !
vronsky told the servant not to announce him , and slipped quietly into the first room .
baroness shilton , a friend of petritsky s , with a rosy little face and flaxen hair , resplendent in a lilac satin gown , and filling the whole room , like a canary , with her parisian chatter , sat at the round table making coffee .
petritsky , in his overcoat , and the cavalry captain kamerovsky , in full uniform , probably just come from duty , were sitting each side of her .
bravo !
vronsky !
shouted petritsky , jumping up , scraping his chair .
our host himself !
baroness , some coffee for him out of the new coffee pot .
why , we didn t expect you !
hope you re satisfied with the ornament of your study , he said , indicating the baroness .
you know each other , of course ?
i should think so , said vronsky , with a bright smile , pressing the baroness s little hand .
what next !
i m an old friend .
you re home after a journey , said the baroness , so i m flying .
oh , i ll be off this minute , if i m in the way .
you re home , wherever you are , baroness , said vronsky .
