something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words ; making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes , and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices , tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick walls , and once crawled on hands and knees through a low , arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location i had managed to preserve .
the things we saw were very old and marvelous , or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them , and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and iron fenceposts and windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity .
we met no person , and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer .
the streetlights we first encountered had been of oil , and of the ancient lozenge pattern .
later i noticed some with candles ; and at last , after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooded gate in a high wall , we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh house unbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides .
this alley led steeply uphill more steeply than i thought possible in this part of new york and the upper end was blocked squarely by the wall of a private estate , beyond which i could see a pale cupola , and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky .
in this wall was a small , gate of black oak , which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key .
leading me within , he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path , and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house , which he unlocked and opened for me .
we entered , and as we did so i grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us , and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay .
my host appeared not to notice this , and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway , across a hall , and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us .
then i saw him pull the curtains of the three windows that barely showed themselves against the lightening sky ; after which he crossed to the mantel , struck flint and steel , lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces , and made a gesture enjoining speech .
in this feeble radiance i saw that we were in a spacious , and paneled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century , with splendid doorway pediments , a delightful doric cornice , and a magnificently carved overmantel with top .
above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were family portraits ; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness , and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful chippendale table .
before seating himself across the table from me , my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment ; then , tardily removing his gloves , hat , and cloak , stood theatrically revealed in full costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to , silk hose , and the buckled shoes i had not previously noticed .
now slowly sinking into a chair , he commenced to eye me intently .
without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before , and i wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my disquiet .
when he spoke at length , his soft , hollow , and carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered ; and now and then i had great difficulty in following him as i listened with a thrill of amazement and alarm which grew each instant .
you behold , sir , my host began , a man of very eccentrical habits for whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations .
reflecting upon better times , i have not scrupled to ascertain their ways , and adopt their dress and manners ; an indulgence which offends none if practised without ostentation .
it hath been my good fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors , swallowed though it was by two towns , first greenwich , which built up hither after , then new york , which joined on near .
there were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family , and i have not been remiss in discharging such obligations .
the squire who succeeded to it in studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries , all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground , and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding .
some curious effects of these arts and discoveries i now purpose to show you , under the strictest secrecy ; and i believe i may rely on my judgement of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity .
he paused , but i could only nod my head .
i have said that i was alarmed , yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of new york , and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts , i had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer .
so i listened .
to my ancestor , he softly continued , there appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind ; qualities having a dominance not only over the acts of one self and of others , but over every variety of force and substance in nature , and over many elements and dimensions deemed more universal than nature herself .
may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain red indians once encamped upon this hill ?
these indians showed choler when the place was built , and were plaguey pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon .
for years they stole over the wall each month when they could , and by stealth performed sartain acts .
then , in , the new squire catched them at their doings , and stood still at what he saw .
thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did , larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old dutchman in the time of the .
arid pox on him , i afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum whether or not by intent for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it .
you , sir , are the first outsider to be told there is a secret , and split me if i have risked tampering that much with the powers had ye not been so hot after bygone things .
i shuddered as the man grew colloquial and with the familiar speech of another day .
he went on .
but you must know , sir , that what the squire got from those mongrel savages was but a small part of the larning he came to have .
he had not been at oxford for nothing , nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in paris .
he was , in fine , made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects ; past the bidding of the vulgar , but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco .
what we want , we may make about us ; and what we do want , we may sweep away .
i wo say that all this is wholly true in body , but is sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then .
you , i conceive , would be tickled by a better sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you ; so be pleased to hold back any fright at what i design to show .
come to the window and be quiet .
my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room , and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold .
his flesh , though dry and firm , was of the quality of ice ; and i almost shrank away from his pulling .
but again i thought of the emptiness and horror of reality , and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever i might be led .
once at the window , the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into the blackness outside .
for a moment i saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights , far , far before me .
then , as if in response to an insidious motion of my host hand , a flash of played over the scene , and i looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliage foliage unpolluted , and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind .
on my right the hudson glittered wickedly , and in the distance ahead i saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies .
the flash died , and an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer .
that was before my time before the new squire time .
pray let us try again .
i was faint , even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had made me .
good god !
i whispered , can you do that for any time ?
and as he nodded , and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs , i clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling .
but he steadied me with that terrible , claw , and once more made his insidious gesture .
again the lightning flashed but this time upon a scene not wholly strange .
it was greenwich , the greenwich that used to be , with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it now , yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy common .
the marsh still glittered beyond , but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york ; trinity and paul and the brick church dominating their sisters , and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole .
i breathed hard , hut not so much from the sight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up .
can you dare you go far ?
i spoke with awe and i think he shared it for a second , but the evil grin returned .
far ?
what i have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone !
back , back forward , forward look , ye puling lackwit !
and as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before .
for full three seconds i could glimpse that pandemoniac sight , and in those seconds i saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams .
i saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things , and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon , and burning from unnumbered windows .
and swarming loathsomely on aerial galleries i saw the yellow , people of that city , robed horribly in orange and red , and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered , the clatter of obscene crotala , and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the wave of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen .
i saw this vista , i say , and heard as with the mind ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it .
it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that had ever stirred in my soul , and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me .
then , as the flash subsided , i saw that my host was trembling too ; a look of shocking fear from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited .
he tottered , clutched at the curtains as i had done before , and wriggled his head wildly , like a hunted animal .
god knows he had cause , for as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious .
it was the steady , stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door , as with the ascent of a barefoot or horde ; and at last the cautious , purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight .
the old man clawed and spat at me through the moldy air , and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched .
the full moon damn ye ye ye yelping dog ye called , and they come for me !
moccasined feet dead men gad sink ye , ye red devils , but i poisoned no rum o ' yours ha i kept your magic safe ye swilled yourselves sick , curse ye , and yet must needs blame the squire let go , you !
unhand that latch i naught for ye here at this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door , and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician .
his fright , turning to steely despair , left room for a resurgence of his rage against me ; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge i was steadying myself .
the curtains , still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me , grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings ; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged .
in those greenish beams the candles paled , and a new semblance of decay spread over the room with its wormy paneling , sagging floor , battered mantel , rickety furniture , and ragged draperies .
it spread over the old man , too , whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence , and i saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons .
only his eyes stayed whole , and they glared with a propulsive , dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled .
the rapping was now repeated with greater insistence , and this time bore a hint of metal .
the black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes , impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction , and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice .
now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels , and i saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood .
i did not move , for i could not ; but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal , shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining , malevolent eyes .
it poured thickly , like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead , overturned a chair as it spread , and finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me .
around that head it closed , totally swallowing it up , and in another moment it had begun to recede ; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me , and flowing again out that black doorway and down the unseen stairs , which creaked as before , though in reverse order .
then the floor gave way at last , and i slid gaspingly down into the nighted chamber below , choking with cobwebs and with terror .
the green moon , shining through broken windows , showed me the hall door half open ; and as i rose from the floor and twisted myself free from the sagged ceiling , i saw sweep past it an awful torrent of blackness , with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it .
it was seeking the door to the cellar , and when it found it , vanished therein .
i now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done , and once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window of some thing which must have been the cupola .
now liberated for the instant from the wreckage , i rushed through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open it , seized a chair and broke a window , climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moon light danced over grass and weeds .
the wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of boxes in a corner i managed to gain the top and cling to the great stone urn set there .
about me in my exhaustion i could see only strange walls and windows and old gambrel roofs .
the steep street of my approach was nowhere visible , and the little i did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight .
suddenly the urn to which i clung began to tremble , as if sharing my own lethal dizziness ; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to i knew not what fate .
the man who found me said that i must have crawled a long way despite my broken bones , for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look .
the gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal , and reports could state no more than that i had appeared from a place unknown , at the entrance to a little black court off perry street .
i never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths , nor would i direct any sane man thither if i could .
of who or what that ancient creature was , i have no idea ; but i repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors .
whither he has gone , i do not know ; but i have gone home to the pure new england lanes up which fragrant sweep at evening .
to be dead , to be truly dead , must be glorious .

.
of herbert west , who was my friend in college and in after life , i can speak only with extreme terror .
this terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance , but was engendered by the whole nature of his , and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago , when we were in the third year of our course at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham .
while he was with me , the wonder and diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly , and i was his closest companion .
now that he is gone and the spell is broken , the actual fear is greater .
memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realities .
the first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock i ever experienced , and it is only with reluctance that i repeat it .
as i have said , it happened when we were in the medical school where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially .
his views , which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and by his , hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life ; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes .
in his experiments with various animating solutions , he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits , , cats , dogs , and monkeys , till he had become the prime nuisance of the college .
several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead ; in many cases violent signs but he soon saw that the perfection of his process , if indeed possible , would necessarily involve a lifetime of research .
it likewise became clear that , since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species , he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress .
it was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities , and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself the learned and benevolent allan halsey , whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of arkham .
i had always been exceptionally tolerant of west pursuits , and we frequently discussed his theories , whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite .
holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process , and that the soul is a myth , my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues ; and that unless actual decomposition has set in , a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life .
that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive which even a short period of death would be apt to cause , west fully realised .
it had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death , and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial were incompatible .
he then sought extreme freshness in his specimens , injecting his solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life .
it was this circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical , for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case .
they did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoningly .
it was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that west confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner , and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly .
to hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly , for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves .
whenever the morgue proved inadequate , two local negroes attended to this matter , and they were seldom questioned .
west was then a small , slender , spectacled youth with delicate features , yellow hair , pale blue eyes , and a soft voice , and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potter field .
we finally decided on the potter field , because practically every body in christchurch was embalmed ; a thing of course ruinous to west researches .
i was by this time his active and enthralled assistant , and helped him make all his decisions , not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work .
it was i who thought of the deserted chapman farmhouse beyond meadow hill , where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory , each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings .
the place was far from any road , and in sight of no other house , yet precautions were none the less necessary ; since rumours of strange lights , started by chance nocturnal roamers , would soon bring disaster on our enterprise .
it was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur .
gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in boston or quietly borrowed from the college materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes and provided spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar .
at the college we used an incinerator , but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory .
bodies were always a nuisance even the small bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in west room at the .
we followed the local like ghouls , for our specimens demanded particular qualities .
what we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation ; preferably free from malforming disease , and certainly with all organs present .
accident victims were our best hope .
not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable ; though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities , ostensibly in the college interest , as often as we could without exciting suspicion .
we found that the college had first choice in every case , so that it might be necessary to remain in arkham during the summer , when only the limited classes were held .
in the end , though , luck favoured us ; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter field ; a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in summer pond , and buried at the town expense without delay or embalming .
that afternoon we found the new grave , and determined to begin work soon after midnight .
it was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours , even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us .
we carried spades and oil dark lanterns , for although electric torches were then manufactured , they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today .
the process of unearthing was slow and sordid it might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists and we were glad when our spades struck wood .
when the pine box was fully uncovered , west scrambled down and removed the lid , dragging out and propping up the contents .
i reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave , and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance .
the affair made us rather nervous , especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy , but we managed to remove all traces of our visit .
when we had patted down the last shovelful of earth , we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old chapman place beyond meadow hill .
on an improvised in the old farmhouse , by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp , the specimen was not very spectral looking .
it had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type , , and a sound animal without psychological subtleties , and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort .
now , with the eyes closed , it looked more asleep than dead ; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score .
we had at last what west had always longed for a real dead man of the ideal kind , ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use .
the tension on our part became very great .
we knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success , and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation .
especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature , since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration .
i , myself , still held some curious notions about the traditional soul of man , and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead .
i wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres , and what he could relate if fully restored to life .
but my wonder was not overwhelming , since for the most part i shared the materialism of my friend .
he was calmer than i as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body arm , immediately binding the incision securely .
the waiting was gruesome , but west never faltered .
every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen , and bore the negative results philosophically .
after about of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate , but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize .
we had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar , and would have to fill it by dawn for although we had fixed a lock on the house , we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery .
besides , the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night .
so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory , we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark , and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution ; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .
the awful event was very sudden , and wholly unexpected .
i was pouring something from one to another , and west was busy over the alcohol which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice , when from the room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard .
not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned , for in one inconceivable cacophony was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature .
human it could not have been it is not in man to make such sounds and without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery , both west and i leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals ; overturning tubes , lamp , and retorts , and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night .
i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town , though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch .
we did not separate , but managed to get to west room , where we whispered with the gas up until dawn .
by then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for investigation , so that we could sleep through the day classes being disregarded .
but that evening two items in the paper , wholly unrelated , made it again impossible for us to sleep .
the old deserted chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes ; that we could understand because of the upset lamp .
also , an attempt had been made to disturb a new grave in the potter field , as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth .
that we could not understand , for we had patted down the mould very carefully .
and for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder , and complain of fancied footsteps behind him .
now he has disappeared .
part the i shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago , when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham .
it is by that satanic scourge that most recall the year , for truly terror brooded with over the piles of coffins in the tombs of christchurch cemetery ; yet for me there is a greater horror in that time a horror known to me alone now that herbert west has disappeared .
west and i were doing work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university , and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead .
after the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean , allan halsey ; though west had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy room , and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its grave in the potter field to a deserted farmhouse beyond meadow hill .
i was with him on that odious occasion , and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which he thought would to some extent restore life chemical and physical processes .
it had ended horribly in a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves and west had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted .
the body had not been quite fresh enough ; it is obvious that to restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed ; and the burning of the old house had prevented us from burying the thing .
it would have been better if we could have known it was underground .
after that experience west had dropped his researches for some time ; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned , he again became importunate with the college faculty , pleading for the use of the and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important .
his pleas , however , were wholly in vain ; for the decision of halsey was inflexible , and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader .
in the radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful enthusiast whose slight form , yellow hair , spectacled blue eyes , and soft voice gave no hint of the supernormal almost diabolical power of the cold brain within .
i can see him now as he was then and i shiver .
he grew sterner of face , but never elderly .
and now sefton asylum has had the mishap and west has vanished .
west clashed disagreeably with halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy .
he felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work ; a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years , but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university .
that the elders should ignore his singular results on animals , and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation , was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of west logical temperament .
only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the type the product of generations of pathetic puritanism ; kindly , conscientious , and sometimes gentle and amiable , yet always narrow , intolerant , , and lacking in perspective .
age has more charity for these incomplete yet high souled characters , whose worst real vice is timidity , and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins sins like ptolemaism , calvinism , , , and every sort of sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation .
west , young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements , had scant patience with good halsey and his erudite colleagues ; and nursed an increasing resentment , coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion .
like most youths , he indulged in elaborate daydreams of revenge , triumph , and final magnanimous forgiveness .
and then had come the scourge , grinning and lethal , from the nightmare caverns of tartarus .
west and i had graduated about the time of its beginning , but had remained for additional work at the summer school , so that we were in arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town .
though not as yet licenced physicians , we now had our degrees , and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew .
the situation was almost past management , and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle .
burials without embalming were made in rapid succession , and even the christchurch cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead .
this circumstance was not without effect on west , who thought often of the irony of the situation so many fresh specimens , yet none for his persecuted researches !
we were frightfully overworked , and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly .
but west gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties .
college had all but closed , and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague .
halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service , applying his extreme skill with energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness .
before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero , though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion .
west could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe , but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines .
taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations , he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university one night , and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution .
the thing actually opened its eyes , but only stared at the ceiling with a look of horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it .
west said it was not fresh enough the hot summer air does not favour corpses .
that time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing , and west doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratory .
the peak of the epidemic was reached in august .
west and i were almost dead , and halsey did die on the .
the students all attended the hasty funeral on the , and bought an impressive wreath , though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy arkham citizens and by the municipality itself .
it was almost a public affair , for the dean had surely been a public benefactor .
after the entombment we were all somewhat depressed , and spent the afternoon at the bar of the commercial house ; where west , though shaken by the death of his chief opponent , chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories .
most of the students went home , or to various duties , as the evening advanced ; but west persuaded me to aid him in making a night of it .
west landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning , with a third man between us ; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather well .
apparently this acidulous matron was right ; for about the whole house was aroused by cries coming from west room , where when they broke down the door , they found the two of us unconscious on the carpet , beaten , scratched , and mauled , and with the broken remnants of west bottles and instruments around us .
only an open window told what had become of our assailant , and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made .
there were some strange garments in the room , but west upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger , but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases .
he ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace .
to the police we both declared ignorance of our late companion identity .
he was , west nervously said , a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location .
we had all been rather jovial , and west and i did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down .
that same night saw the beginning of the second arkham horror the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself .
christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing ; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description , but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed .
the victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight the dawn revealed the unutterable thing .
the manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of bolton was questioned , but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage .
those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb , where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate .
a fainter trail led away toward the woods , but it soon gave out .
the next night devils danced on the roofs of arkham , and unnatural madness howled in the wind .
through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague , and which some whispered was the embodied of the plague itself .
eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wake in all , seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless , sadistic monster that crept abroad .
a few persons had half seen it in the dark , and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend .
it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked , for sometimes it had been hungry .
the number it had killed was fourteen ; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive .
on the third night frantic bands of searchers , led by the police , captured it in a house on crane street near the miskatonic campus .
they had organised the quest with care , keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations , and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window , the net was quickly spread .
on account of the general alarm and precautions , there were only two more victims , and the capture was effected without major casualties .
the thing was finally stopped by a bullet , though not a fatal one , and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathing .
for it had been a man .
this much was clear despite the nauseous eyes , the voiceless simianism , and the daemoniac savagery .
they dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at sefton , where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen years until the recent mishap , when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention .
what had most disgusted the searchers of arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster face was cleaned the mocking , unbelievable resemblance to a learned and martyr who had been entombed but three days before the late allan halsey , public benefactor and dean of the medical school of miskatonic university .
to the vanished herbert west and to me the disgust and horror were supreme .
i shudder tonight as i think of it ; shudder even more than i did that morning when west muttered through his bandages , damn it , it was quite fresh enough !
part six shots by moonlight published april in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
it is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient , but many things in the life of herbert west were uncommon .
it is , for instance , not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office , yet that was the case with herbert west .
when he and i obtained our degrees at the medical school of miskatonic university , and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners , we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated , and as near as possible to the potter field .
reticence such as this is seldom without a cause , nor indeed was ours ; for our requirements were those resulting from a distinctly unpopular .
outwardly we were doctors only , but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible moment for the essence of herbert west existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown , in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyard cold clay .
such a quest demands strange materials , among them fresh human bodies ; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment .
west and i had met in college , and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments .
gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant , and now that we were out of college we had to keep together .
it was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company , but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in bolton a factory town near arkham , the seat of the college .
the bolton worsted mills are the largest in the miskatonic valley , and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians .
we chose our house with the greatest care , seizing at last on a rather cottage near the end of pond street ; five numbers from the closest neighbour , and separated from the local potter field by only a stretch of meadow land , bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north .
the distance was greater than we wished , but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field , wholly out of the factory district .
we were not much displeased , however , since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies .
the walk was a trifle long , but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbed .
our practice was surprisingly large from the very first large enough to please most young doctors , and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere .
the were of somewhat turbulent inclinations ; and besides their many natural needs , their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do .
but what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar the laboratory with the long table under the electric lights , where in the small hours of the morning we often injected west various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potter field .
west was experimenting madly to find something which would start man vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death , but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles .
the solution had to be differently compounded for different types what would serve for would not serve for human beings , and different human specimens required large modifications .
the bodies had to be exceedingly fresh , or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible .
indeed , the greatest problem was to get them fresh enough west had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage .
the results of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total failures , and we both held fearsome recollections of such things .
ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on meadow hill in arkham , we had felt a brooding menace ; and west , though a calm , blond , scientific automaton in most respects , often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit .
he half felt that he was followed a psychological delusion of shaken nerves , enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alive a frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at sefton .
then there was another our first whose exact fate we had never learned .
we had fair luck with specimens in bolton much better than in arkham .
we had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial , and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed .
it had lost an arm if it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better .
between then and the next january we secured three more ; one total failure , one case of marked muscular motion , and one rather shivery thing it rose of itself and uttered a sound .
then came a period when luck was poor ; interments fell off , and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use .
we kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic care .
one march night , however , we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potter field .
in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result .
surreptitious and bouts among the were common , and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported .
this late winter night there had been such a match ; evidently with disastrous results , since two timorous poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case .
we followed them to an abandoned barn , where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floor .
the match had been between kid a lubberly and now quaking youth with a most hooked nose and buck robinson , the harlem smoke .
the negro had been knocked out , and a moment examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so .
he was a loathsome , thing , with abnormally long arms which i could not help calling fore legs , and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable congo secrets and poundings under an eerie moon .
the body must have looked even worse in life but the world holds many ugly things .
fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd , for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up ; and they were grateful when west , in spite of my involuntary shudders , offered to get rid of the thing quietly for a purpose i knew too well .
there was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape , but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows , as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham .
we approached the house from the field in the rear , took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs , and prepared it for the usual experiment .
our fear of the police was absurdly great , though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that section .
the result was wearily anticlimactic .
ghastly as our prize appeared , it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm ; solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only .
so as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn , we did as we had done with the others dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter field , and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish .
the grave was not very deep , but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound .
in the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines , fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense .
the next day i was increasingly apprehensive about the police , for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death .
west had still another source of worry , for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly .
an italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinner and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart .
it was a very foolish hysteria , for the boy had often run away before ; but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious , and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts .
about seven in the evening she had died , and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill west , whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life .
friends had held him when he drew a stiletto , but west departed amidst his inhuman shrieks , curses and oaths of vengeance .
in his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have forgotten his child , who was still missing as the night advanced .
there was some talk of searching the woods , but most of the family friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man .
altogether , the nervous strain upon west must have been tremendous .
thoughts of the police and of the mad italian both weighed heavily .
we retired about eleven , but i did not sleep well .
bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town , and i could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down .
it might mean the end of all our local work and perhaps prison for both west and me .
i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about .
after the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes , but i turned over without rising to pull down the shade .
then came the steady rattling at the back door .
i lay still and somewhat dazed , but before long heard west rap on my door .
he was clad in and slippers , and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight .
from the revolver i knew that he was thinking more of the crazed italian than of the police .
we better both go , he whispered .
it would do not to answer it anyway , and it may be a patient it would be like one of those fools to try the back door .
so we both went down the stairs on tiptoe , with a fear partly justified and partly that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours .
the rattling continued , growing somewhat louder .
when we reached the door i cautiously unbolted it and threw it open , and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there , west did a peculiar thing .
despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigation a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottage my friend suddenly , excitedly , and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor .
for that visitor was neither italian nor policeman .
looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmares a , apparition nearly on all fours , covered with bits of mould , leaves , and vines , foul with caked blood , and having between its glistening teeth a snow white , terrible , cylindrical object terminating in a tiny hand .
part the scream of the dead published may in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
the scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of herbert west which harassed the latter years of our companionship .
it is natural that such a thing as a dead man scream should give horror , for it is obviously , not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence ; but i was used to similar experiences , hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance .
and , as i have implied , it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .
herbert west , whose associate and assistant i was , possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician .
that was why , when establishing his practice in bolton , he had chosen an isolated house near the potter field .
briefly and brutally stated , west sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation , leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution .
for this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies ; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure , and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms .
scores of rabbits and had been killed and treated , but their trail was a blind one .
west had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh .
what he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed ; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life .
there was hope that this second and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection , but we had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action .
to establish the artificial motion , natural life must be extinct the specimens must be very fresh , but genuinely dead .
the awesome quest had begun when west and i were students at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham , vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical nature of life .
that was seven years before , but west looked scarcely a day older now he was small , blond , , , and spectacled , with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his terrible investigations .
our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme ; the results of defective reanimation , when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid , unnatural , and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution .
one thing had uttered a scream ; another had risen violently , beaten us both to unconsciousness , and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind asylum bars ; still another , a loathsome african monstrosity , had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deed west had had to shoot that object .
we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated , so had perforce created nameless horrors .
it was disturbing to think that one , perhaps two , of our monsters still lived that thought haunted us shadowingly , till finally west disappeared under frightful circumstances .
but at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated bolton cottage , our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens .
west was more avid than i , so that it almost seemed to me that he looked at any very healthy living physique .
it was in july , , that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn .
i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois , and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation .
he had , he told me excitedly , in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new angle that of artificial preservation .
i had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound , and was not surprised that it had turned out well ; but until he explained the details i was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work , since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them .
this , i now saw , west had clearly recognised ; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use , and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse , as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the bolton .
at last fate had been kind , so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun .
what would happen on reanimation , and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason , west did not venture to predict .
the experiment would be a landmark in our studies , and he had saved the new body for my return , so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashion .
west told me how he had obtained the specimen .
it had been a vigorous man ; a stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the bolton worsted mills .
the walk through the town had been long , and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories , his heart had become greatly overtaxed .
he had refused a stimulant , and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later .
the body , as might be expected , seemed to west a heaven sent gift .
in his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in bolton , and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one robert leavitt of louis , apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance .
if this man could not be restored to life , no one would know of our experiment .
we buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the potter field .
if , on the other hand , he could be restored , our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established .
so without delay west had injected into the body wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival .
the matter of the presumably weak heart , which to my mind imperilled the success of our experiment , did not appear to trouble west extensively .
he hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained before a rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal , living creature .
so on the night of july , , herbert west and i stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white , silent figure beneath the dazzling .
the embalming compound had worked uncannily well , for as i stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening , i was moved to seek west assurance that the thing was really dead .
this assurance he gave readily enough ; reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests as to life , since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present .
as west proceeded to take preliminary steps , i was impressed by the vast intricacy of the new experiment ; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate than his own .
forbidding me to touch the body , he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound .
this , he said , was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected .
slightly later , when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs ; west stuffed a object violently over the twitching face , not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation .
the pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness , withdrew satisfied , and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir , prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days , when our feats were new and groping .
i can not express the wild , breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech , perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .
west was a materialist , believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena ; consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death barrier .
i did not wholly disagree with him theoretically , yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers ; so that i could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation .
besides i could not extract from my memory that hideous , inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at arkham .
very little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure .
a touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto , and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard .
west , who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist , suddenly nodded significantly ; and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the body mouth .
there followed a few spasmodic muscular motions , and then an audible breathing and visible motion of the chest .
i looked at the closed eyelids , and thought i detected a quivering .
then the lids opened , shewing eyes which were grey , calm , and alive , but still unintelligent and not even curious .
in a moment of fantastic whim i whispered questions to the reddening ears ; questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present .
subsequent terror drove them from my mind , but i think the last one , which i repeated , was where have you been ?
i do not yet know whether i was answered or not , for no sound came from the well shaped mouth ; but i do know that at that moment i firmly thought the thin lips moved silently , forming syllables which i would have vocalised as only now if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy .
at that moment , as i say , i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained ; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason .
in the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph ; no doubt that the solution had truly accomplished , at least temporarily , its full mission of restoring rational and articulate life to the dead .
but in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrors not horror of the thing that spoke , but of the deed that i had witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joined .
for that very fresh body , at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth , threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air , and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return , screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain help !
keep off , you cursed little fiend keep that damned needle away from me !
part v the horror from the shadows published june in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
many men have related hideous things , not mentioned in print , which happened on the battlefields of the great war .
some of these things have made me faint , others have convulsed me with devastating nausea , while still others have made me tremble and look behind me in the dark ; yet despite the worst of them i believe i can myself relate the most hideous thing of all the shocking , the unnatural , the unbelievable horror from the shadows .
in i was a physician with the rank of first lieutenant in a canadian regiment in flanders , one of many americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle .
i had not entered the army on my own initiative , but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant i was the celebrated boston surgical specialist , herbert west .
west had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war , and when the chance had come , he carried me with him almost against my will .
there were reasons why i could have been glad to let the war separate us ; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating ; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague influence secured a medical commission as major , i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .
when i say that west was avid to serve in battle , i do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation .
always an intellectual machine ; slight , blond , , and spectacled ; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality .
there was , however , something he wanted in embattled flanders ; and in order to secure it had had to assume a military exterior .
what he wanted was not a thing which many persons want , but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow , and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results .
it was , in fact , nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment .
herbert west needed fresh bodies because his was the reanimation of the dead .
this work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in boston ; but was only too well known to me , who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in miskatonic university medical school at arkham .
it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments , first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained .
there was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things , and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways .
he had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula , for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it .
terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures ; nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh .
a certain number of these failures had remained alive one was in an asylum while others had vanished and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stolidity .
west had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens , and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in .
in college , and during our early practice together in the factory town of bolton , my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration ; but as his boldness in methods grew , i began to develop a gnawing fear .
i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies ; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it .
that was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse ; and his success , obtained at such a loathsome cost , had completely hardened him .
of his methods in the intervening five years i dare not speak .
i was held to him by sheer force of fear , and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat .
gradually i came to find herbert west himself more horrible than anything he did that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness .
his interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal ; he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust ; he became , behind his pallid intellectuality , a fastidious baudelaire of physical experiment a languid elagabalus of the tombs .
dangers he met unflinchingly ; crimes he committed unmoved .
i think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored , and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies .
he had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and separated from natural physiological systems ; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of , artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile .
two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle first , whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain , proceeding from the spinal cord and various ; and second , whether any kind of ethereal , intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism .
all this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh and that was why herbert west had entered the great war .
the phantasmal , unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march , , in a field hospital behind the lines of eloi .
i wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium .
west had a private laboratory in an east room of the temporary edifice , assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming .
there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares i could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things .
at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers ; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind , requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned .
among these sounds were frequent surely not uncommon on a battlefield , but distinctly uncommon in an hospital .
west reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience .
besides human tissue , west employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results .
it was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments , and that was now my friend chief activity .
in a dark corner of the laboratory , over a queer incubating burner , he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian ; which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously .
on the night of which i speak we had a splendid new specimen a man at once physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured .
it was rather ironic , for he was the officer who had helped west to his commission , and who was now to have been our associate .
moreover , he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under west .
major sir eric moreland , , was the greatest surgeon in our division , and had been hastily assigned to the eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters .
he had come in an aeroplane piloted by the intrepid lieut .
ronald hill , only to be shot down when directly over his destination .
the fall had been spectacular and awful ; hill was unrecognisable afterward , but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition .
west had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and ; and i shuddered when he finished severing the head , placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile tissue to preserve it for future experiments , and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table .
he injected new blood , joined certain veins , arteries , and nerves at the headless neck , and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officer uniform .
i knew what he wanted to see if this highly organised body could exhibit , without its head , any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished sir eric moreland .
once a student of reanimation , this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it .
i can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body .
the scene i can not describe i should faint if i tried it , for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things , with blood and lesser human debris almost on the slimy floor , and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting , bubbling , and baking over a winking spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows .
the specimen , as west repeatedly observed , had a splendid nervous system .
much was expected of it ; and as a few twitching motions began to appear , i could see the feverish interest on west face .
he was ready , i think , to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness , reason , and personality can exist independently of the brain that man has no central connective spirit , but is merely a machine of nervous matter , each section more or less complete in itself .
in one triumphant demonstration west was about to relegate the mystery of life to the category of myth .
the body now twitched more vigorously , and beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way .
the arms stirred disquietingly , the legs drew up , and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing .
then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperation an intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of herbert west .
certainly , the nerves were recalling the man last act in life ; the struggle to get free of the falling aeroplane .
what followed , i shall never positively know .
it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german who can gainsay it , since west and i were the only proved survivors ?
west liked to think that before his recent disappearance , but there were times when he could not ; for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination .
the hideous occurrence itself was very simple , notable only for what it implied .
the body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping , and we had heard a sound .
i should not call that sound a voice , for it was too awful .
and yet its timbre was not the most awful thing about it .
neither was its message it had merely screamed , jump , ronald , for god sake , jump !
the awful thing was its source .
for it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadows .
part the published july in home brew vol .
, no .
, when herbert west disappeared a year ago , the boston police questioned me closely .
they suspected that i was holding something back , and perhaps suspected graver things ; but i could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it .
they knew , indeed , that west had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men ; for his hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect secrecy ; but the final catastrophe held elements of daemoniac phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what i saw .
i was west closest friend and only confidential assistant .
we had met years before , in medical school , and from the first i had shared his terrible researches .
he had slowly tried to perfect a solution which , injected into the veins of the newly deceased , would restore life ; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions .
still more shocking were the products of some of the experiments grisly masses of flesh that had been dead , but that west waked to a blind , brainless , nauseous animation .
these were the usual results , for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate .
this need for very fresh corpses had been west moral undoing .
they were hard to get , and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous .
a struggle , a needle , and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse , and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment ; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared , and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique .
toward the last i became acutely afraid of west , for he began to look at me that way .
people did not seem to notice his glances , but they noticed my fear ; and after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions .
west , in reality , was more afraid than i ; for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow .
partly it was the police he feared ; but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous , touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life , and from which he had not seen that life depart .
he usually finished his experiments with a revolver , but a few times he had not been quick enough .
there was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen .
there was also that arkham professor body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at sefton , where it beat the walls for sixteen years .
most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak of for in later years west scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania , and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies , or parts joined to organic matter other than human .
it had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared ; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print .
the great war , through which both of us served as surgeons , had intensified this side of west .
in saying that west fear of his specimens was nebulous , i have in mind particularly its complex nature .
part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless monsters , while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him .
their disappearance added horror to the situation of them all , west knew the whereabouts of only one , the pitiful asylum thing .
then there was a more subtle fear a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the canadian army in .
west , in the midst of a severe battle , had reanimated major sir eric moreland , , a who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them .
the head had been removed , so that the possibilities of life in the trunk might be investigated .
just as the building was wiped out by a german shell , there had been a success .
the trunk had moved intelligently ; and , unbelievable to relate , we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory .
the shell had been merciful , in a way but west could never feel as certain as he wished , that we two were the only survivors .
he used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead .
west last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance , overlooking one of the oldest in boston .
he had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons , since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies .
the laboratory was in a secretly constructed by imported workmen , and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal of such bodies , or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies , as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner .
during the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient masonry ; undoubtedly connected with the old , yet far too deep to correspond with any known sepulchre therein .
after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills , where the last interment had been made in .
i was with him when he studied the nitrous , dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of the men , and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the uncovering of centuried ; but for the first time west new timidity conquered his natural curiosity , and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over .
thus it remained till that final hellish night ; part of the walls of the secret laboratory .
i speak of west decadence , but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing .
outwardly he was the same to the last calm , cold , slight , and , with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change .
he seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and looked over his shoulder ; even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and pawed at sefton bars .
the end of herbert west began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me .
a strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages , and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years .
something fearsome and incredible had happened at sefton asylum fifty miles away , stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police .
in the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds , and their leader had aroused the attendants .
he was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried .
his expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty , but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass .
some nameless accident had befallen this man .
a larger man guided his steps ; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady .
the speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from arkham sixteen years before ; and upon being refused , gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot .
the fiends had beaten , trampled , and bitten every attendant who did not flee ; killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster .
those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the leader .
by the time help could be summoned , every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanished .
from the hour of reading this item until midnight , west sat almost paralysed .
at midnight the doorbell rang , startling him fearfully .
all the servants were asleep in the attic , so i answered the bell .
as i have told the police , there was no wagon in the street , but only a group of figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice , express prepaid .
they filed out of the house with a jerky tread , and as i watched them go i had an odd idea that they were turning toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted .
when i slammed the door after them west came downstairs and looked at the box .
it was about two feet square , and bore west correct name and present address .
it also bore the inscription , from eric moreland , eloi , flanders .
six years before , in flanders , a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of , and upon the detached head which perhaps had uttered articulate sounds .
west was not even excited now .
his condition was more ghastly .
quickly he said , it the finish but let incinerate this .
we carried the thing down to the laboratory listening .
i do not remember many particulars you can imagine my state of mind but it is a vicious lie to say it was herbert west body which i put into the incinerator .
we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box , closed the door , and started the electricity .
nor did any sound come from the box , after all .
it was west who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb masonry had been covered up .
i was going to run , but he stopped me .
then i saw a small black aperture , felt a ghoulish wind of ice , and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth .
there was no sound , but just then the electric lights went out and i saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity or worse could create .
their outlines were human , , fractionally human , and not human at all the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous .
they were removing the stones quietly , one by one , from the centuried wall .
and then , as the breach became large enough , they came out into the laboratory in single file ; led by a talking thing with a beautiful head made of wax .
a sort of monstrosity behind the leader seized on herbert west .
west did not resist or utter a sound .
then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes , bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations .
west head was carried off by the leader , who wore a canadian officer uniform .
as it disappeared i saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic , visible emotion .
servants found me unconscious in the morning .
west was gone .
the incinerator contained only unidentifiable ashes .
detectives have questioned me , but what can i say ?
the sefton tragedy they will not connect with west ; not that , nor the men with the box , whose existence they deny .
i told them of the vault , and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed .
so i told them no more .
they imply that i am either a madman or a murderer probably i am mad .
but i might not be mad if those accursed had not been so silent .
may the merciful gods , if indeed there be such , guard those hours when no power of the will , or drug that the cunning of man devises , can keep me from the chasm of sleep .
death is merciful , for there is no return therefrom , but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night , haggard and knowing , peace rests nevermore .
fool that i was to plunge with such unsanctioned frensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate ; fool or god that he was my only friend , who led me and went before me , and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine !
we met , i recall , in a railway station , where he was the center of a crowd of the vulgarly curious .
he was unconscious , having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight body a strange rigidity .
i think he was then approaching forty years of age , for there were deep lines in the face , wan and , but oval and actually beautiful ; and touches of gray in the thick , waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black .
his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus , and of a height and breadth almost .
i said to myself , with all the ardor of a sculptor , that this man was a faun statue out of antique hellas , dug from a temple ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years .
and when he opened his immense , sunken , and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only friend the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before for i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality ; realms which i had cherished in fancy , but vainly sought .
so as i drove the crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries , and he assented without speaking a word .
afterward i found that his voice was music the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres .
we talked often in the night , and in the day , when i chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalize his different expressions .
of our studies it is impossible to speak , since they held so slight a connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it .
they were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter , time , and space , and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men , and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men .
the cosmos of our waking knowledge , born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester , touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jester whim .
men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly .
wise men have interpreted dreams , and the gods have laughed .
one man with oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative , and men have laughed .
but even that man with oriental eyes has done no more than suspect .
i had wished and tried to do more than suspect , and my friend had tried and partly succeeded .
then we both tried together , and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old in hoary kent .
among the agonies of these after days is that chief of inarticulateness .
what i learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told for want of symbols or suggestions in any language .
i say this because from first to last our discoveries partook only of the nature of sensations ; sensations correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving .
they were sensations , yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and space things which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence .
human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings ; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present , rushing aerially along shocking , unlighted , and abysses , and occasionally tearing through certain and typical obstacles describable only as viscous , uncouth clouds of vapors .
in these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together .
when we were together , my friend was always far ahead ; i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me , golden from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty , its anomalously youthful cheeks , its burning eyes , its olympian brow , and its shadowing hair and growth of beard .
of the progress of time we kept no record , for time had become to us the merest illusion .
i know only that there must have been something very singular involved , since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old .
our discourse was unholy , and always hideously ambitious no god or demon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like those which we planned in whispers .
i shiver as i speak of them , and dare not be explicit ; though i will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue , and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky .
i will hint only hint that he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more ; designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command , and the destinies of all living things be his .
i affirm i swear that i had no share in these extreme aspirations .
anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be erroneous , for i am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve success .
there was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacuum beyond all thought and entity .
perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us ; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy , yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others .
viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession , and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known .
my friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether , and i could see the sinister exultation on his floating , luminous , .
suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared , and in a brief space i found myself projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate .
it was like the others , yet incalculably denser ; a sticky clammy mass , if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a sphere .
i had , i felt , been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed .
struggling anew , i came to the end of the drug dream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellow dreamer , weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed light on his marble features .
then , after a short interval , the form in the corner stirred ; and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me .
i can not tell you how he shrieked , or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright .
i can only say that i fainted , and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolation .
that was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream .
awed , shaken , and portentous , my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again .
what he had seen , he dared not tell me ; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible , even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake .
that he was right , i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed .
after each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older , whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking .
it is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before one eyes .
our mode of life was now totally altered .
heretofore a recluse so far as i true name and origin never having passed his lips my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude .
at night he would not be alone , nor would the company of a few persons calm him .
his sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort ; so that few assemblies of the young and gay were unknown to us .
our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which i keenly resented , but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude .
especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining , and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein .
he did not always glance at the same place in the seemed to be a different place at different times .
on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast .
in the summer it would be nearly overhead .
in the autumn it would be in the northwest .
in winter it would be in the east , but mostly if in the small hours of morning .
midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him .
only after two years did i connect this fear with anything in particular ; but then i began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance a spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealis .
we now had a studio in london , never separating , but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world .
we were aged and weak from our drugs , dissipations , and nervous overstrain , and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become .
our freedom from long sleep was surprising , for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace .
then came one january of fog and rain , when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy .
my statues and ivory heads were all sold , and i had no means to purchase new materials , or energy to fashion them even had i possessed them .
we suffered terribly , and on a certain night my friend sank into a sleep from which i could not awaken him .
i can recall the scene now the desolate , garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down ; the ticking of our lone clock ; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the ; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house ; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space ; and , worst of all , the deep , steady , sinister breathing of my friend on the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden , unimagined , and hideously remote .
the tension of my vigil became oppressive , and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind .
i heard a clock strike somewhere not ours , for that was not a striking clock and my morbid fancy found in this a new for idle wanderings .
clocks time space then my fancy reverted to the locale as i reflected that even now , beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere , corona borealis was rising in the northeast .
corona borealis , which my friend had appeared to dread , and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether .
all at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of sounds a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away ; droning , clamoring , mocking , calling , from the northeast .
but it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed ; not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door .
it was not what i heard , but what i saw ; for in that dark , locked , shuttered , and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible light a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness , but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper , bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful as i had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time , when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret , innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmare .
and as i looked , i beheld the head rise , the black , liquid , and deep sunken eyes open in terror , and the thin , shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered .
there dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face , as it shone bodiless , luminous , and rejuvenated in the blackness , more of stark , teeming , fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me .
no word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer , but as i followed the mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source , the source whence also the whining came , i , too , saw for an instant what it saw , and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police .
never could i tell , try as i might , what it actually was that i saw ; nor could the still face tell , for although it must have seen more than i did , it will never speak again .
but always i shall guard against the mocking and insatiate hypnos , lord of sleep , against the night sky , and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy .
just what happened is unknown , for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing , but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness .
they have said , i know not for what reason , that i never had a friend ; but that art , philosophy , and insanity had filled all my tragic life .
the lodgers and police on that night soothed me , and the doctor administered something to quiet me , nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place .
my stricken friend moved them to no pity , but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me , and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours , bald , , shriveled , palsied , , and broken , adoring and praying to the object they found .
for they deny that i sold the last of my statuary , and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold , petrified , and unvocal .
it is all that remains of my friend ; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage ; a godlike head of such marble as only old hellas could yield , young with the youth that is outside time , and with beauteous bearded face , curved , smiling lips , olympian brow , and dense locks waving and .
they say that that haunting is modeled from my own , as it was at twenty five ; but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of attica .
mystery attracts mystery .
ever since the wide appearance of my name as a performer of unexplained feats , i have encountered strange narratives and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities .
some of these have been trivial and irrelevant , some deeply dramatic and absorbing , some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and historical research .
many of these matters i have told and shall continue to tell very freely ; but there is one of which i speak with great reluctance , and which i am now relating only after a session of grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine , who had heard vague rumors of it from other members of my family .
the hitherto guarded subject pertains to my visit to egypt fourteen years ago , and has been avoided by me for several reasons .
for one thing , i am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at cairo , who can not be wholly ignorant of them .
for another thing , i dislike to recount an incident in which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part .
what i saw or thought i saw certainly did not take place ; but is rather to be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in egyptology , and of the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally prompted .
these imaginative stimuli , magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself , undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long past .
in january , , i had finished a professional engagement in england and signed a contract for a tour of australian theatres .
a liberal time being allowed for the trip , i determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly interests me ; so accompanied by my wife i drifted pleasantly down the continent and embarked at marseilles on the p amp ; o steamer malwa , bound for port said .
from that point i proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower egypt before leaving finally for australia .
the voyage was an agreeable one , and enlivened by many of the amusing incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work .
i had intended , for the sake of quiet travel , to keep my name a secret ; but was goaded into betraying myself by a whose anxiety to astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito .
i mention this because of its ultimate effect an effect i should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter throughout the nile valley .
what it did was to herald my identity wherever i subsequently went , and deprive my wife and me of all the placid inconspicuousness we had sought .
traveling to seek curiosities , i was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself !
we had come to egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically impressive , but found little enough when the ship edged up to port said and discharged its passengers in small boats .
low dunes of sand , bobbing buoys in shallow water , and a drearily european small town with nothing of interest save the great de lesseps statue , made us anxious to get to something more worth our while .
after some discussion we decided to proceed at once to cairo and the pyramids , later going to alexandria for the australian boat and for whatever sights that ancient metropolis might present .
the railway journey was tolerable enough , and consumed only four hours and a half .
we saw much of the suez canal , whose route we followed as far as ismailiya and later had a taste of old egypt in our glimpse of the restored canal of the middle empire .
then at last we saw cairo glimmering through the growing dusk ; a winkling constellation which became a blaze as we halted at the great gare centrale .
but once more disappointment awaited us , for all that we beheld was european save the costumes and the crowds .
a prosaic subway led to a square teeming with carriages , taxicabs , and and gorgeous with electric lights shining on tall buildings ; whilst the very theatre where i was vainly requested to play and which i later attended as a spectator , had recently been renamed the cosmograph ' .
we stopped at shepheard hotel , reached in a taxi that sped along broad , smartly streets ; and amidst the perfect service of its restaurant , elevators and generally luxuries the mysterious east and immemorial past seemed very far away .
the next day , however , precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the arabian nights atmosphere ; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of cairo , the bagdad of seemed to live again .
guided by our baedeker , we had struck east past the ezbekiyeh gardens along the mouski in quest of the native quarter , and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone who notwithstanding later developments was assuredly a master at his trade .
not until afterward did i see that i should have applied at the hotel for a licensed guide .
this man , a shaven , peculiarly and relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a pharaoh and called himself reis el drogman ' appeared to have much power over others of his kind ; though subsequently the police professed not to know him , and to suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority , whilst ' is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word for a leader of tourist parties dragoman .
abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of .
old cairo is itself a and a dream labyrinths of narrow alleys redolent of aromatic secrets ; arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting above the cobbled streets ; maelstroms of oriental traffic with strange cries , cracking whips , rattling carts , jingling money , and braying donkeys ; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes , veils , turbans , and tarbushes ; and dervishes , dogs and cats , soothsayers and barbers ; and over all the whining of blind beggars crouched in alcoves , and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep , unchanging blue .
the roofed , quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring .
spice , perfume , incense beads , rugs , silks , and brass old mahmoud suleiman squats amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize mustard in the capital of an ancient classic column a roman corinthian , perhaps from neighboring heliopolis , where augustus stationed one of his three egyptian legions .
antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism .
and then the mosques and the museum we saw them all , and tried not to let our arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of pharaonic egypt which the museum priceless treasures offered .
that was to be our climax , and for the present we concentrated on the mediaeval saracenic glories of the califs whose magnificent form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the arabian desert .
at length abdul took us along the sharia mohammed ali to the ancient mosque of sultan hassan , and the , beyond which climbs the pass to the mighty citadel that saladin himself built with the stones of forgotten pyramids .
it was sunset when we scaled that cliff , circled the modern mosque of mohammed ali , and looked down from the dizzy parapet over mystic cairo mystic cairo all golden with its carven domes , its ethereal minarets and its flaming gardens .
far over the city towered the great roman dome of the new museum ; and beyond it across the cryptic yellow nile that is the mother of eons and dynasties lurked the menacing sands of the libyan desert , undulant and iridescent and evil with older arcana .
the red sun sank low , bringing the relentless chill of egyptian dusk ; and as it stood poised on the world rim like that ancient god of heliopolis , the we saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the pyramids of gizeh the palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when amen mounted his golden throne in distant thebes .
then we knew that we were done with saracen cairo , and that we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal egypt the black kem of re and amen , isis and osiris .
the next morning we visited the pyramids , riding out in a victoria across the island of chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees , and the smaller english bridge to the western shore .
down the shore road we drove , between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast zoological gardens to the suburb of gizeh , where a new bridge to cairo proper has since been built .
then , turning inland along the , we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till before us loomed the objects of our quest , cleaving the mists of dawn and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools .
forty centuries , as napoleon had told his campaigners there , indeed looked down upon us .
the road now rose abruptly , till we finally reached our place of transfer between the trolley station and the mena house hotel .
abdul reis , who capably purchased our pyramid tickets , seemed to have an understanding with the crowding , yelling and offensive bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler ; for he kept them very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us , himself mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys more expensive than useful .
the area to be traversed was so small that camels were hardly needed , but we did not regret adding to our experience this troublesome form of desert navigation .
the pyramids stand on a high rock plateau , this group forming next to the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the neighborhood of the extinct capital memphis , which lay on the same side of the nile , somewhat south of gizeh , and which flourished between and .
the greatest pyramid , which lies nearest the modern road , was built by king cheops or khufu about , and stands more than feet in perpendicular height .
in a line southwest from this are successively the second pyramid , built a generation later by king khephren , and though slightly smaller , looking even larger because set on higher ground , and the radically smaller third pyramid of king mycerinus , built about .
near the edge of the plateau and due east of the second pyramid , with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of khephren , its royal restorer , stands the monstrous sphinx mute , sardonic , and wise beyond mankind and memory .
minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several places , and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than royal rank .
these latter were originally marked by mastabas , or stone structures about the deep burial shafts , as found in other memphian cemeteries and exemplified by perneb tomb in the metropolitan museum of new york .
at gizeh , however , all such visible things have been swept away by time and pillage ; and only the shafts , either or cleared out by archaeologists , remain to attest their former existence .
connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or vital principle of the deceased .
the small tombs have their chapels contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures , but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids , where regal pharaohs lay , were separate temples , each to the east of its corresponding pyramid , and connected by a causeway to a massive or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau .
the leading to the second pyramid , nearly buried in the drifting sands , yawns subterraneously of the sphinx .
persistent tradition dubs it the of the sphinx ' ; and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the sphinx indeed represents the second pyramid builder khephren .
there are unpleasant tales of the sphinx before khephren but whatever its elder features were , the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus without fear .
it was in the great that the diorite statue of khephren now in the cairo museum was found ; a statue before which i stood in awe when i beheld it .
whether the whole edifice is now excavated i am not certain , but in most of it was below ground , with the entrance heavily barred at night .
germans were in charge of the work , and the war or other things may have stopped them .
i would give much , in view of my experience and of certain bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in cairo , to know what has developed in connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of the pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboons .
the road , as we traversed it on our camels that morning , curved sharply past the wooden police quarters , post office , drug store and shops on the left , and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the great pyramid .
past cyclopean masonry we rode , rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal nile glistened to the east , and the eternal desert shimmered to the west .
very close loomed the three major pyramids , the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of great stones , but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering which had made them smooth and finished in their day .
presently we descended toward the sphinx , and sat silent beneath the spell of those terrible unseeing eyes .
on the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the emblem of , for whose image the sphinx was mistaken in a late dynasty ; and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws , we recalled what thutmosis inscribed thereon , and the dream he had when a prince .
it was then that the smile of the sphinx vaguely displeased us , and made us wonder about the legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature , leading down , down , to depths none might dare hint at depths connected with mysteries older than the dynastic egypt we excavate , and having a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal , animal headed gods in the ancient nilotic pantheon .
then , too , it was i asked myself in idle question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour .
other tourists now began to overtake us , and we moved on to the sand choked temple of the sphinx , fifty yards to the southeast , which i have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the second pyramid mortuary chapel on the plateau .
most of it was still underground , and although we dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall , i felt that abdul and the local german attendant had not shown us all there was to see .
after this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau , examining the second pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east , the third pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel , the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the fourth and fifth dynasties , and the famous campbell tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope .
cries now assailed us from the great pyramid , where bedouins were besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and down .
seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent , but many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite impetus of liberal baksheesh .
they did not get this impetus , though we did let abdul take us up , thus obtaining a view of unprecedented magnificence which included not only remote and glittering cairo with its crowned citadel background of hills , but all the pyramids of the memphian district as well , from abu roash on the north to the dashur on the south .
the sakkara , which marks the evolution of the low mastaba into the true pyramid , showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance .
it is close to this transition monument that the famed tomb of perneb was found more than four hundred miles north of the theban rock valley where sleeps .
again i was forced to silence through sheer awe .
the prospect of such antiquity , and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood over , filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave me .
fatigued by our climb , and disgusted with the importunate bedouins whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste , we omitted the arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids , though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through cheops ' mightiest memorial .
as we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to cairo with abdul reis under the afternoon sun , we half regretted the omission we had made .
such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid passages not in the guidebooks ; passages whose entrances had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them .
of course , this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it ; but it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the pyramids at night , or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the great pyramid .
perhaps in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was feared the effect on the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry ; joined to the life he has known by the merest tube , in which he may only crawl , and which any accident or evil design might block .
the whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity .
for me this opportunity came much earlier than i expected .
that evening , the members of our party feeling some what tired after the strenuous program of the day , i went alone with abdul reis for a walk through the picturesque arab quarter .
though i had seen it by day , i wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk , when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion .
the native crowds were thinning , but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of reveling bedouins in the , or bazaar of the coppersmiths .
their apparent leader , an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush , took some notice of us , and evidently recognized with no great friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide .
perhaps , i thought , he resented that odd reproduction of the sphinx which i had often remarked with amused irritation ; or perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of abdul voice .
at any rate , the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk ; and before long ali ziz , as i heard the stranger called when called by no worse name , began to pull violently at abdul robe , an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and would have reached an even direr condition had i not intervened and separated them by main force .
my interference , at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides , succeeded at last in effecting a truce .
sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire , and with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden , the two formed a curious pact of honor which i soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in cairo a pact for the settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop the great pyramid , long after the departure of the last moonlight sightseer .
each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds , and the affair was to begin at midnight , proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion .
in all this planning there was much which excited my interest .
the fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular , while the thought of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of imagination in me .
a request found abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds ; so that all the rest of the early evening i accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions of the town mostly northeast of the ezbekiyeh where he gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his pugilistic background .
shortly after nine our party , mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or names as , ' twain , ' ' j .
morgan , ' and , ' edged through street labyrinths both oriental and occidental , crossed the muddy and nile by the bridge of the bronze lions , and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to gizeh .
slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip , toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists , saluted the last inbound , and were alone with the night and the past and the spectral moon .
then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue , ghoulish with a dim atavistical menace which i had not seemed to notice in the daytime .
even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly for was it not in this that they had buried queen nitocris alive in the sixth dynasty ; subtle queen nitocris , who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the nile , and drowned them by opening the ?
i recalled that the arabs whisper things about nitocris , and shun the third pyramid at certain phases of the moon .
it must have been over her that thomas moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by memphian boatmen subterranean nymph that dwells sunless gems and glories hid the lady of the pyramid ! '
early as we were , ali ziz and his party were ahead of us ; for we saw their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at ; toward which squalid arab settlement , close to the sphinx , we had diverged instead of following the regular road to the mena house , where some of the sleepy , inefficient police might have observed and halted us .
here , where filthy bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of khephren courtiers , we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the great pyramid , up whose sides the arabs swarmed eagerly , abdul reis offering me the assistance i did not need .
as most travelers know , the actual apex of this structure has long been worn away , leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square .
on this eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed , and in a few moments the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which , but for the quality of the ringside cries , might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in america .
as i watched it , i felt that some of our institutions were not lacking ; for every blow , feint , and defense bespoke ' to my not inexperienced eye .
it was quickly over , and despite my misgivings as to methods i felt a sort of proprietary pride when abdul reis was adjudged the winner .
reconciliation was phenomenally rapid , and amidst the singing , fraternizing and drinking that followed , i found it difficult to realize that a quarrel had ever occurred .
oddly enough , i myself seemed to be more a center of notice than the antagonists ; and from my smattering of arabic i judged that they were discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement , in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me , but a distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape .
it gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of egypt did not depart without leaving traces , and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly have survived surreptitiously amongst the fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed .
i thought of how much my guide abdul reis looked like an old egyptian priest or pharaoh or smiling sphinx and wondered .
suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby i had accepted this night events as other than the empty and malicious ' they now showed themselves to be .
without warning , and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign from abdul , the entire band of bedouins precipitated itself upon me ; and having produced heavy ropes , soon had me bound as securely as i was ever bound in the course of my life , either on the stage or off .
i struggled at first , but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians .
my hands were tied behind my back , my knees bent to their fullest extent , and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords .
a stifling gag was forced into my mouth , and a blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes .
then , as arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid , i heard the taunts of my late guide abdul , who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice , and assured me that i was soon to have my ' put to a supreme test which would quickly remove any egotism i might have gained through triumphing over all the tests offered by america and europe .
egypt , he reminded me , is very old , and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today , whose devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me .
how far or in what direction i was carried , i can not tell ; for the circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment .
i know , however , that it could not have been a great distance ; since my bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk , yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time .
it is this perplexing brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever i think of gizeh and its plateau for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist routes of what existed then and must exist still .
the evil abnormality i speak of did not become manifest at first .
setting me down on a surface which i recognized as sand rather than rock , my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in the ground , into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling .
for apparent eons i bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which i took to be one of the numerous of the plateau until the prodigious , almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture .
the horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second .
that any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core of the planet itself , or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless profundities of nether earth , were beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to accept them .
even now i am uncertain , for i know how deceitful the sense of time becomes when one is removed or distorted .
but i am quite sure that i preserved a logical consciousness that far ; that at least i did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality , and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination .
all this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting .
the shocking ordeal was cumulative , and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase in my rate of descent .
they were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly now , and i scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as i shot madly downward .
my clothing was in tatters , and i felt the trickle of blood all over , even above the mounting and excruciating pain .
my nostrils , too , were assailed by a scarcely definable menace a creeping odor of damp and staleness curiously unlike anything i had ever smelled before , and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery .
then the mental cataclysm came .
it was horrible hideous beyond all articulate description because it was all of the soul , with nothing of detail to describe .
it was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish .
the suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniac one moment i was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of torture , yet the next moment i was soaring on bat wings in the gulfs of hell ; swinging free and swooping through illimitable miles of boundless , musty space ; rising dizzily to measureless pinnacles of chilling ether , then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous , nauseous lower vacua thank god for the mercy that shut out in oblivion those clawing furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties , and tore at my spirit !
that one respite , short as it was , gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the road ahead .
it was very gradually that i regained my senses after that eldritch flight through stygian space .
the process was infinitely painful , and colored by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment .
the precise nature of these dreams was very clear while i was experiencing them , but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward , and was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible events real or imaginary which followed .
i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw ; a yellow , hairy , paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulf me .
and when i stopped to reflect what the paw was , it seemed to me that it was egypt .
in the dream i looked back at the events of the preceding weeks , and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little , subtly and insidiously , by some hellish of the elder nile sorcery ; some spirit that was in egypt before ever man was , and that will be when man is no more .
i saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of egypt , and the grisly alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead .
i saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls , falcons , cats , and ibises ; phantom processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly , and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods .
stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch .
and behind it all i saw the ineffable malignity of primordial necromancy , black and amorphous , and fumbling greedily after me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by emulation .
in my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and pursuit , and i saw the black soul of egypt singling me out and calling me in inaudible whispers ; calling and luring me , leading me on with the glitter and glamor of a saracenic surface , but ever pulling me down to the catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart .
then the dream faces took on human resemblances , and i saw my guide abdul reis in the robes of a king , with the sneer of the sphinx on his features .
and i knew that those features were the features of khephren the great , who raised the second pyramid , carved over the sphinx face in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock .
and i looked at the long , lean rigid hand of khephren ; the long , lean , rigid hand as i had seen it on the diorite statue in the cairo museum the statue they had found in the terrible gateway temple and wondered that i had not shrieked when i saw it on abdul reis that hand !
it was hideously cold , and it was crushing me ; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus the chill and constriction of unrememberable egypt it was nighted , necropolitan egypt itself , that yellow paw and they whisper such things of khephren
but at this juncture i began to wake or at least , to assume a condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding .
i recalled the fight atop the pyramid , the treacherous bedouins and their attack , my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths , and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic putrescence .
i perceived that i now lay on a damp rock floor , and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force .
it was very cold , and i seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across me .
the cuts and bruises i had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft were paining me woefully , their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draft , and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony .
as i turned i felt a tug from above , and concluded that the rope whereby i was lowered still reached to the surface .
whether or not the arabs still held it , i had no idea ; nor had i any idea how far within the earth i was .
i knew that the darkness around me was wholly or nearly total , since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold ; but i did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had characterized my descent .
knowing at least that i was in a space of considerable extent reached from the above surface directly by an opening in the rock , i doubtfully conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old khephren the temple of the sphinx perhaps some inner corridors which the guides had not shown me during my morning visit , and from which i might easily escape if i could find my way to the barred entrance .
it would be a labyrinthine wandering , but no worse than others out of which i had in the past found my way .
the first step was to get free of my bonds , gag , and blindfold ; and this i knew would be no great task , since subtler experts than these arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an exponent of escape , yet had never succeeded in defeating my methods .
then it occurred to me that the arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords , as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably held .
this , of course , was taking for granted that my place of confinement was indeed khephren temple of the sphinx .
the direct opening in the roof , wherever it might lurk , could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the sphinx ; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface , since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous .
i had not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage , but knew that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands .
thinking these matters over as i lay bent and bound on the rock floor , i nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so lately reduced me to a coma .
my present thought was only to outwit the arabs , and i accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible , avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedom .
this , however , was more easily determined than effected .
a few preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable motion ; and it did not surprise me when , after one especially energetic struggle , i began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me .
obviously , i thought , the bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope ; hastening no doubt to the temple true entrance to lie murderously in wait for me .
the prospect was not pleasing but i had faced worse in my time without flinching , and would not flinch now .
at present i must first of all free myself of bonds , then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed .
it is curious how implicitly i had come to believe myself in the old temple of khephren beside the sphinx , only a short distance below the ground .
that belief was shattered , and every pristine apprehension of preternatural depth and demoniac mystery revived , by a circumstance which grew in horror and significance even as i formulated my philosophical plan .
i have said that the falling rope was piling up about and upon me .
now i saw that it was continuing to pile , as no rope of normal length could possibly do .
it gained in momentum and became an avalanche of hemp , accumulating mountainously on the floor and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils .
soon i was completely engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and stifled me .
my senses tottered again , and i vaguely tried to fight off a menace desperate and ineluctable .
it was not merely that i was tortured beyond human endurance not merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of me it was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of rope implied , and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me .
my endless descent and swinging flight through goblin space , then , must have been real , and even now i must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet .
such a sudden confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable , and a second time i lapsed into merciful oblivion .
when i say oblivion , i do not imply that i was free from dreams .
on the contrary , my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most unutterable hideousness .
god ! if only i had not read so much egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror !
this second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic secrets , and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves .
i recalled , in which it is well that i do not remember , the peculiar and elaborate construction of egyptian sepulchers ; and the exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this construction .
all these people thought of was death and the dead .
they conceived of a literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care , and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse ; whilst besides the body they believed in two other elements , the soul , which after its weighing and approval by osiris dwelt in the land of the blest , and the obscure and portentous ka or which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a horrible way , demanding occasional access to the preserved body , consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel , and sometimes as men whispered taking its body or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly repellent .
for thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring glassily upward when not visited by the ka , awaiting the day when osiris should restore both ka and soul , and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep .
it was to have been a glorious rebirth but not all souls were approved , nor were all tombs inviolate , so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish abnormalities were to be looked for .
even today the arabs murmur of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether abysses , which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and return unscathed .
perhaps the most leeringly legends are those which relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft composite mummies made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods .
at all stages of history the sacred animals were mummified , so that consecrated bulls , cats , ibises , crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater glory .
but only in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal in the same mummy only in the decadence , when they did not understand the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul .
what happened to those composite mummies is not told of at least publicly and it is certain that no egyptologist ever found one .
the whispers of arabs are very wild , and can not be relied upon .
they even hint that old khephren he of the sphinx , the second pyramid and the yawning gateway temple lives far underground wedded to the nitocris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of beast .
it was of these of khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid dead that i dreamed , and that is why i am glad the exact have faded from my memory .
my most horrible vision was connected with an idle question i had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected .
that question , so innocent and whimsical then , assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?
my second awakening if awakening it was is a memory of stark hideousness which nothing else in my life save one thing which came after can parallel ; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most men .
remember that i had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position .
now , as perception returned , i felt the entire weight gone ; and realized upon rolling over that although i was still tied , gagged and blindfolded , some agency had removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me .
the significance of this condition , of course , came to me only gradually ; but even so i think it would have brought unconsciousness again had i not by this time reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference .
i was alone with what ?
before i could torture myself with any new reflection , or make any fresh effort to escape from my bonds , an additional circumstance became manifest .
pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs , and i seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could furnish .
my chest , too , seemed pierced by a hundred wounds , as though some malign , titanic ibis had been pecking at it .
assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one , and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled to desist .
yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect .
instead of sinking into a bottomless pit of despair , i was stirred to a new courage and action ; for now i felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on an even basis .
on the strength of this thought i tugged again at my bonds , and used all the art of a lifetime to free myself as i had so often done amidst the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds .
the familiar details of my escaping process commenced to engross me , and now that the long rope was gone i half regained my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all , and that there had never been any terrible shaft , measureless abyss or interminable rope .
was i after all in the gateway temple of khephren beside the sphinx , and had the sneaking arabs stolen in to torture me as i lay helpless there ?
at any rate , i must be free .
let me stand up unbound , ungagged , and with eyes open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source , and i could actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes !
how long i took in shaking off my encumbrances i can not tell .
it must have been longer than in my exhibition performances , because i was wounded , exhausted , and enervated by the experiences i had passed through .
when i was finally free , and taking deep breaths of a chill , damp , evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges , i found that i was too cramped and fatigued to move at once .
there i lay , trying to stretch a frame bent and mangled , for an indefinite period , and straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my position .
by degrees my strength and flexibility returned , but my eyes beheld nothing .
as i staggered to my feet i peered diligently in every direction , yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that i had known when blindfolded .
i tried my legs , beneath my shredded trousers , and found that i could walk ; yet could not decide in what direction to go .
obviously i ought not to walk at random , and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance i sought ; so i paused to note the difference of the cold , fetid , which i had never ceased to feel .
accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to the abyss , i strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward it .
i had a with me , and even a small electric flashlight ; but of course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy articles .
as i walked cautiously in the blackness , the draft grew stronger and more offensive , till at length i could regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the fisherman jar in the eastern tale .
the east egypt truly , this dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels unspeakable !
the more i reflected on the nature of this cavern wind , the greater my sense of disquiet became ; for although despite its odor i had sought its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world , i now saw plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection whatsoever with the clean air of the libyan desert , but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down .
i had , then , been walking in the wrong direction !
after a moment reflection i decided not to retrace my steps .
away from the draft i would have no landmarks , for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of distinctive configurations .
if , however , i followed up the strange current , i would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort , from whose gate i could perhaps work round the walls to the opposite side of this cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall .
that i might fail , i well realized .
i saw that this was no part of khephren gateway temple which tourists know , and it struck me that this particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists , and merely stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant arabs who had imprisoned me .
if so , was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air ?
what evidence , indeed , did i now possess that this was the gateway temple at all ?
for a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me , i thought of that vivid melange of impressions descent , suspension in space , the rope , my wounds , and the dreams that were frankly dreams .
was this the end of life for me ?
or indeed , would it be merciful if this moment were the end ?
i could answer none of my own questions , but merely kept on , till fate for a third time reduced me to oblivion .
this time there were no dreams , for the suddenness of the incident shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious .
tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the offensive draft became strong enough to offer an actual physical resistance , i was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved .
that i ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy human organism .
often i look back to that night and feel a touch of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness ; lapses whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period .
of course , it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred ; and that all the features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic and dawn flushed face of the great sphinx .
i prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as i can , hence was glad when the police told me that the barrier to krephren gateway temple had been found unfastened , and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part .
i was glad , too , when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be expected from my seizure , blindfolding , lowering , struggling with bonds , falling some distance perhaps into a depression in the temple inner gallery dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it , and experiences like that , a very soothing diagnosis .
and yet i know that there must be more than appears on the surface .
that extreme descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissed and it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my guide , abdul reis el drogman the guide who looked and smiled like king khephren .
i have digressed from my connected narrative perhaps in the vain hope of evading the telling of that final incident ; that incident which of all is most certainly an hallucination .
but i promised to relate it , and i do not break promises .
when i recovered or seemed to recover my senses after that fall down the black stone stairs , i was quite as alone and in darkness as before .
the windy stench , bad enough before , was now fiendish ; yet i had acquired enough familiarity by this time to bear it stoically .
dazedly i began to crawl away from the place whence the putrid wind came , and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal blocks of a mighty pavement .
once my head struck against a hard object , and when i felt of it i learned that it was the base of a column a column of unbelievable immensity whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch .
crawling on , i encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances apart ; when suddenly my attention was captured by the realization of something which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it .
from some still lower chasm in earth bowels were proceeding certain sounds , measured and definite , and like nothing i had ever heard before .
that they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial i felt almost intuitively ; and much reading in egyptology led me to associate them with the flute , the sambuke , the sistrum , and the tympanum .
in their rhythmic piping , droning , rattling and beating i felt an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth a terror peculiarly dissociated from personal fear , and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for our planet , that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies .
the sounds increased in volume , and i felt that they were approaching .
then and may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears again i began to hear , faintly and afar off , the morbid and millennial tramping of the marching things .
it was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect rhythm .
the training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of earth inmost monstrosities padding , clicking , walking , stalking , rumbling , lumbering , crawling and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments .
and then god keep the memory of those arab legends out of my head ! the mummies without souls the of the wandering kas the hordes of the pharaonic dead of forty centuries the composite mummies led through the uttermost onyx voids by king khephren and his ghoul queen nitocris
the tramping drew nearer heaven save me from the sound of those feet and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail !
down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous wind and i drew behind the enormous circumference of a cyclopic column that i might escape for a while the horror that was stalking toward me through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity .
the flickers increased , and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud .
in the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that i gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion .
bases of columns whose middles were higher than human sight , mere bases of things that must each dwarf the eiffel tower to insignificance hieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend
i would not look at the marching things .
that i desperately resolved as i heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead tramping .
it was merciful that they did not speak but god !
their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns .
hippopotami should not have human hands and carry torches men should not have the heads of crocodiles
i tried to turn away , but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were everywhere .
then i remembered something i used to do in half conscious nightmares as a boy , and began to repeat to myself , is a dream !
this is a dream ! '
but it was of no use , and i could only shut my eyes and pray at least , that is what i think i did , for one is never sure in visions and i know this can have been nothing more .
i wondered whether i should ever reach the world again , and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if i could discern any feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction , the topless columns , and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror .
the sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone , and unless this hellish place were wholly without walls , i could not fail to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon .
but i had to shut my eyes again when i realized how many of the things were assembling and when i glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadily without any body above the waist .
a fiendish and ululant or now split the very atmosphere the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen blasts in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies .
my eyes , perversely shaken open , gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic , fear and physical exhaustion .
the things had filed ceremonially in one direction , the direction of the noisome wind , where the light of their torches showed their bended heads or the bended heads of such as had heads .
they were worshipping before a great black aperture which reached up almost out of sight , and which i could see was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in shadow .
one of these was indubitably the staircase i had fallen down .
the dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columns an ordinary house would have been lost in it , and any average public building could easily have been moved in and out .
it was so vast a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its boundaries so vast , so hideously black , and so aromatically stinking .
directly in front of this yawning the things were throwing objects evidently sacrifices or religious offerings , to judge by their gestures .
khephren was their leader ; sneering king khephren or the guide abdul reis , crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead .
by his side knelt beautiful queen nitocris , whom i saw in profile for a moment , noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls .
and i shut my eyes again when i saw what objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its possible local deity .
it occurred to me that , judging from the elaborateness of this worship , the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance .
was it osiris or isis , horus or anubis , or some vast unknown god of the dead still more central and supreme ?
there is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an unknown one before ever the known gods were worshipped and now , as i steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of those nameless things , a thought of escape flashed upon me .
the hall was dim , and the columns heavy with shadow .
with every creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures , it might be barely possible for me to creep past to the end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen ; trusting to fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches .
where i was , i neither knew nor seriously reflected upon and for a moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which i knew to be a dream .
was i in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of khephren gateway temple that temple which generations have persistently called the temple of the sphinx ?
i could not conjecture , but i resolved to ascend to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me .
wriggling flat on my stomach , i began the anxious journey toward the foot of the staircase , which seemed the more accessible of the two .
i can not describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl , but they may be guessed when one reflects on what i had to watch steadily in that malign , torchlight in order to avoid detection .
the bottom of the staircase was , as i have said , far away in shadow , as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted landing above the titanic aperture .
this placed the last stages of my crawl at some distance from the noisome herd , though the spectacle chilled me even when quite remote at my right .
at length i succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb ; keeping close to the wall , on which i observed decorations of the most hideous sort , and relying for safety on the absorbed , ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched the aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before it .
though the staircase was huge and steep , fashioned of vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant , the ascent seemed virtually interminable .
dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of agonizing memory .
i had intended , on reaching the landing , to climb immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there ; stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet below yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous and chorus , coming as i had nearly gained the top of the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery , caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet .
the monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it .
it was something quite ponderous , even as seen from my height ; something yellowish and hairy , and endowed with a sort of nervous motion .
it was as large , perhaps , as a hippopotamus , but very curiously shaped .
it seemed to have no neck , but five separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk ; the first very small , the second , the third and fourth equal and largest of all , and the fifth rather small , though not so small as the first .
out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture .
once in a while the thing would leap up , and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner .
its locomotion was so inexplicable that i stared in fascination , wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me .
then it did emerge it did emerge , and at the sight i turned and fled into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me ; fled unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or logic guided me , and which i must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation .
it must have been a dream , or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic face of the great sphinx .
the great sphinx !
god ! that idle question i asked myself on that sun blest morning before what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?
accursed is the sight , be it in dream or not , that revealed to me the supreme horror the unknown god of the dead , which licks its colossal chops in the unsuspected abyss , fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not exist .
the monster that emerged that monster as large as a hippopotamus the five headed monster and that of which it is the merest forepaw
but i survived , and i know it was only a dream .
birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in , yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it .
neither did his old physician davis , who died years ago .
it was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of peck valley cemetery , escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means ; but while this much was undoubtedly true , there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last .
he confided in me because i was his doctor , and because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after davis died .
he was a bachelor , wholly without relatives .
birch , before , had been the village undertaker of peck valley ; and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go .
the practices i heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today , at least in a city ; and even peck valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly apparel invisible beneath the casket lid , and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy .
most distinctly birch was lax , insensitive , and professionally undesirable ; yet i still think he was not an evil man .
he was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless , careless , and liquorish , as his easily avoidable accident proves , and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste .
just where to begin birch story i can hardly decide , since i am no practiced teller of tales .
i suppose one should start in the cold december of , when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring .
fortunately the village was small and the death rate low , so that it was possible to give all of birch inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated receiving tomb .
the undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter weather , and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness .
never did he knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets , or disregard more flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandon .
at last the spring thaw came , and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb .
birch , though dreading the bother of removal and interment , began his task of transference one disagreeable april morning , but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse , after having laid but one mortal tenent to its permanent rest .
that was darius peck , the nonagenarian , whose grave was not far from the tomb .
birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old matthew fenner , whose grave was also near by ; but actually postponed the matter for three days , not getting to work till good friday , the .
being without superstition , he did not heed the day at all ; though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week .
certainly , the events of that evening greatly changed george birch .
on the afternoon of friday , april , then , birch set out for the tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of matthew fenner .
that he was not perfectly sober , he subsequently admitted ; though he had not then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget certain things .
he was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse , which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head , much as on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it .
the day was clear , but a high wind had sprung up ; and birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and entered the vault .
another might not have relished the damp , odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins ; but birch in those days was insensitive , and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right grave .
he had not forgotten the criticism aroused when hannah bixby relatives , wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they had moved , found the casket of judge capwell beneath her headstone .
the light was dim , but birch sight was good , and he did not get asaph sawyer coffin by mistake , although it was very similar .
he had , indeed , made that coffin for matthew fenner ; but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and flimsy , in a fit of curious sentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had been to him during his bankruptcy five years before .
he gave old matt the very best his skill could produce , but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen , and to use it when asaph sawyer died of a malignant fever .
sawyer was not a lovable man , and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied .
to him birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the fenner casket .
it was just as he had recognised old matt coffin that the door slammed to in the wind , leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before .
the narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays , and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all ; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch .
in this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles , pushed at the iron panels , and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant .
in this twilight too , he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply .
for the long neglected latch was obviously broken , leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault , a victim of his own oversight .
the thing must have happened at about in the afternoon .
birch , being by temperament phlegmatic and practical , did not shout long ; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb .
it is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position , but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly .
his day work was sadly interrupted , and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither , he might have to remain all night or longer .
the pile of tools soon reached , and a hammer and chisel selected , birch returned over the coffins to the door .
the air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome ; but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled , half by feeling , at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch .
he would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle ; but lacking these , bungled semi sightlessly as best he might .
when he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding , at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these , birch glanced about for other possible points of escape .
the vault had been dug from a hillside , so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth , making this direction utterly useless to consider .
over the door , however , the high , transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker ; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it .
there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb , and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the door .
only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping stones , and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of transporting them .
three , he reckoned , would permit him to reach the transom ; but he could do better with four .
the boxes were fairly even , and could be piled up like blocks ; so he began to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep .
as he planned , he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made .
whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty , is strongly to be doubted .
finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall , to place upon this two layers of two each , and upon these a single box to serve as the platform .
this arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness , and would furnish the desired height .
better still , though , he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure , leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude .
and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight , heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course .
several of the coffins began to split under the stress of handling , and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of little matthew fenner for the top , in order that his feet might have as certain a surface as possible .
in the he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one , and indeed came upon it almost by accident , since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layer .
the tower at length finished , and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device , birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom .
the borders of the space were entirely of brick , and there seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body to pass .
as his hammer blows began to fall , the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and to others may have been mocking .
in either case it would have been appropriate ; for the unexpected tenacity of the brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes , and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus .
dusk fell and found birch still toiling .
he worked largely by feeling now , since newly gathered clouds hid the moon ; and though progress was still slow , he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture .
he could , he was sure , get out by midnight though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications .
undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time , the place , and the company beneath his feet , he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork ; cursing when a fragment hit him in the face , and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree .
in time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then , shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked .
he would not , he found , have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height ; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit .
it must have been midnight at least when birch decided he could get through the transom .
tired and perspiring despite many rests , he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside .
the hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily , and he vaguely wished it would stop .
he was curiously unelated over his impending escape , and almost dreaded the exertion , for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age .
as he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly ; especially when , upon reaching the topmost one , he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood .
he had , it seems , planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform ; for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way , jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine .
maddened by the sound , or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air , the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh , and plunged madly off through the night , the wagon rattling crazily behind it .
birch , in his ghastly situation , was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom ; but gathered his energies for a determined try .
clutching the edges of the aperture , he sought to pull himself up , when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles .
in another moment he knew fear for the first time that night ; for struggle as he would , he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity .
horrible pains , as of savage wounds , shot through his calves ; and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters , loose nails , or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box .
perhaps he screamed .
at any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a .
instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom , and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground .
he could not walk , it appeared , and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge ; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste , and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare .
there was evidently , however , no pursuer ; for he was alone and alive when armington , the , answered his feeble clawing at the door .
armington helped birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son edwin for davis .
the afflicted man was fully conscious , but would say nothing of any consequence ; merely muttering such things as oh , my ankles !
, let go !
, or shut in the tomb .
then the doctor came with his and asked crisp questions , and removed the patient outer clothing , shoes , and socks .
the wounds for both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the achilles ' tendons seemed to puzzle the old physician greatly , and finally almost to frighten him .
his questioning grew more than medically tense , and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members ; binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible .
for an impersonal doctor , davis ' ominous and awestruck became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience .
he was oddly anxious to know if birch were sure absolutely sure of the identity of that top coffin of the pile ; how he had chosen it , how he had been certain of it as the fenner coffin in the dusk , and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious asaph sawyer .
would the firm fenner casket have caved in so readily ?
davis , an village practitioner , had of course seen both at the respective funerals , as indeed he had attended both fenner and sawyer in their last illnesses .
he had even wondered , at sawyer funeral , how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive fenner .
after a full two hours davis left , urging birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood .
what else , he added , could ever in any case be proved or believed ?
but it would be well to say as little as could be said , and to let no other doctor treat the wounds .
birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story ; and when i saw the scars ancient and whitened as they then were i agreed that he was wise in so doing .
he always remained lame , for the great tendons had been severed ; but i think the greatest lameness was in his soul .
his thinking processes , once so phlegmatic and logical , had become ineffaceably scarred ; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as friday , tomb , coffin , and words of less obvious concatenation .
his frightened horse had gone home , but his frightened wits never quite did that .
he changed his business , but something always preyed upon him .
it may have been just fear , and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities .
his drinking , of course , only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate .
when davis left birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb .
the moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade , and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside .
steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms , the doctor entered and looked about , stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced .
he cried aloud once , and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry .
then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient , and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol .
it was asaph coffin , birch , just as i thought !
i knew his teeth , with the front ones missing on the upper jaw never , for god sake , show those wounds !
the body was pretty badly gone , but if ever i saw vindictiveness on any face or former face you know what a fiend he was for revenge how he ruined old raymond thirty years after their boundary suit , and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last august he was the devil incarnate , birch , and i believe his fury could beat old father death himself .
god , what a rage !
i hate to have it aimed at me !
why did you do it , birch ?
he was a scoundrel , and i do blame you for giving him a coffin , but you always did go too damned far !
well enough to skimp on the thing some way , but you knew what a little man old fenner was .
i never get the picture out of my head as long as i live .
you kicked hard , for asaph coffin was on the floor .
his head was broken in , and everything was tumbled about .
i seen sights before , but there was one thing too much here .
an eye for an eye !
great heavens , birch , but you got what you deserved .
the skull turned my stomach , but the other was worse those ankles cut neatly off to fit matt fenner coffin !
it was a lonely and deserted country , but at last i spied a roof among a clump of trees near the small river on my right ; perhaps a full from the road , and probably reachable by some path or drive which i would presently come upon .
in the absence of any nearer dwelling , i resolved to try my luck there ; and was glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone gateway , covered with dry , dead vines and choked with undergrowth which explained why i had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first distant view .
i saw that i could not drive the car in , so i parked it very carefully near the gate where a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rain and got out for the long walk to the house .
traversing that path in the gathering twilight i was conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding , probably induced by the air of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway .
from the carvings on the old stone pillars i inferred that this place was once an estate of manorial dignity ; and i could clearly see that the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees , some of which had died , while others had lost their special identity among the wild scrub growths of the region .
as i ploughed onward , cockleburs and stickers clung to my clothes , and i began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all .
was i tramping on a vain errand ?
for a moment i was tempted to go back and try some farm farther along the road , when a view of the house ahead aroused my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spirit .
there was something provocatively fascinating in the , decrepit pile before me , for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era and a far more southerly environment .
it was a typical wooden plantation house of the classic , early pattern , with two and a half stories and a great ionic portico whose pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a triangular pediment .
its state of decay was extreme and obvious ; one of the vast columns having rotted and fallen to the ground , while the upper piazza or balcony had sagged dangerously low .
other buildings , i judged , had formerly stood near it .
as i mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and fanlighted doorway i felt distinctly nervous , and started to light a cigarette desisting when i saw how dry and inflammable everything about me was .
though now convinced that the house was deserted , i nevertheless hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking ; so tugged at the rusty iron knocker until i could get it to move , and finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make the whole place shake and rattle .
there was no response , yet once more i plied the cumbrous , creaking device as much to dispel the sense of unholy silence and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruin .
somewhere near the river i heard the mournful note of a dove , and it seemed as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible .
half in a dream , i seized and rattled the ancient latch , and finally gave the great door a frank trying .
it was unlocked , as i could see in a moment ; and though it stuck and grated on its hinges i began to push it open , stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as i did so .
but the moment i took this step i regretted it .
it was not that a legion of specters confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly empire furniture ; but that i knew all at once that the place was not deserted at all .
there was a creaking on the great curved staircase , and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending .
then i saw a tall , bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great palladian window on the landing .
my first start of terror was soon over , and as the figure descended the final flight i was ready to greet the householder whose privacy i had invaded .
in the i could see him reach in his pocket for a match .
there came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs .
in the feeble glow was revealed the stooping figure of a very tall , emaciated old man ; disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face , yet for all that with the bearing and expression of a gentleman .
i did not wait for him to speak , but at once began to explain my presence .
you pardon my coming in like this , but when my knocking did raise anybody i concluded that no one lived here .
what i wanted originally was to know the right road to cape girardeau the shortest road , that is .
i wanted to get there before dark , but now , of course as i paused , the man spoke ; in exactly the cultivated tone i had expected , and with a mellow accent as unmistakably southern as the house he inhabited .
rather , you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly .
i live in a very retired way , and am not usually expecting visitors .
at first i thought you were a mere .
then when you knocked again i started to answer , but i am not well and have to move very slowly .
spinal neuritis very troublesome case .
but as for your getting to town before dark it plain you ca do that .
the road you are on for i suppose you came from the gate is the best or shortest way .
what you must do is to take your first left after you leave the gate that is , the first real road to your left .
there are three or four cart paths you can ignore , but you ca mistake the real road because of the extra large willow tree on the right just opposite it .
then when you turned , keep on past two roads and turn to the right along the third .
after that please wait a moment !
how can i follow all these clues in pitch darkness , without ever having been near here before , and with only an indifferent pair of headlights to tell me what is and what is a road ?
besides , i think it going to storm pretty soon , and my car is an open one .
it looks as if i were in a bad fix if i want to get to cape girardeau tonight .
the fact is , i do think i better try to make it .
i do like to impose burdens , or anything like that but in view of the circumstances , do you suppose you could put me up for the night ?
i wo be any trouble no meals or anything .
just let me have a corner to sleep in till daylight , and i all right .
i can leave the car in the road where it is a bit of wet weather wo hurt it if worst comes to worst .
as i made my sudden request i could see the old man face lose its former expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd , surprised look .
sleep here ?
he seemed so astonished at my request that i repeated it .
yes , why not ?
i assure you i wo be any trouble .
what else can i do ?
i a stranger hereabouts , these roads are a labyrinth in the dark , and i wager it be raining torrents outside of an hour this time it my host turn to interrupt , and as he did so i could feel a peculiar quality in his deep , musical voice .
a stranger of course you must be , else you would think of sleeping here , would think of coming here at all .
people do come here nowadays .
he paused , and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke .
there was surely something alluringly queer about this place , and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak a thousand secrets .
again i noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything about me ; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp .
i felt woefully chilly , and saw with regret that no heating was provided , and yet so great was my curiosity that i still wished most ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal abode .
let that be as it may , i replied .
i ca help about other people .
but i surely would like to have a spot to stop till daylight .
still if people do relish this place , may it be because it getting so ?
of course i suppose it would a take a fortune to keep such an estate up , but if the burden too great why do you look for smaller quarters ?
why try to stick it out here in this way with all the hardships and discomforts ?
the man did not seem offended , but answered me very gravely .
surely you may stay if you really wish to you can come to no harm that i know of .
but others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable influences here .
as for me i stay here because i have to .
there is something i feel it a duty to guard something that holds me .
i wish i had the money and health and ambition to take decent care of the house and grounds .
with my curiosity still more heightened , i prepared to take my host at his word ; and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so .
it was very dark now , and a faint pattering outside told me that the threatened rain had come .
i would have been glad of any shelter , but this was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place and its master .
for an incurable lover of the grotesque , no more fitting haven could have been provided .
there was a corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest of the house , and into this my host led me , setting down his small lamp and lighting a somewhat larger one .
from the cleanliness and contents of the room , and from the books ranged along the walls , i could see that i had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman of taste and of breeding .
he was a hermit and eccentric , no doubt , but he still had standards and intellectual interests .
as he waved me to a seat i began a conversation on general topics , and was pleased to find him not at all taciturn .
if anything , he seemed glad of someone to talk to , and did not even attempt to swerve the discussion from personal topics .
he was , i learned , one antoine de russy , of an ancient , powerful , and cultivated line of louisiana planters .
more than a century ago his grandfather , a younger son , had migrated to southern missouri and founded a new estate in the lavish ancestral manner ; building this pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great plantation .
there had been , at one time , as many as negroes in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rear ground that the river had now invaded and to hear them singing and laughing and playing the banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a civilization and social order now sadly extinct .
in front of the house , where the great guardian oaks and willows stood , there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet , always watered and trimmed and with flagstoned , walks curving through it .
riverside for such the place was called had been a lovely and idyllic homestead in its day ; and my host could recall it when many traces of its best period remained .
it was raining hard now , with dense sheets of water beating against the insecure roof , walls , and windows , and sending in drops through a thousand chinks and crevices .
moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected places , and the mounting wind rattled the rotting , shutters outside .
but i minded none of this , for i saw that a story was coming .
incited to reminiscence , my host made a move to shew me to ; but kept on recalling the older , better days .
soon , i saw , i would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that ancient place , and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences .
his voice was very musical as he spoke on , and his tale soon took a turn which left me no chance to grow drowsy .
yes riverside was built in , and my father was born in .
he be over a century old now if he were alive , but he died young so young i can just barely remember him .
in that was he was killed in the war , seventh louisiana infantry , for he went back to the old home to enlist .
my grandfather was too old to fight , yet he lived on to be , and helped my mother bring me up .
a good , too i give them credit .
we always had strong traditions high notions of honor and my grandfather saw to it that i grew up the way de russys have grown up , generation after generation , ever since the crusades .
we were quite wiped out financially , but managed to get on very comfortable after the war .
i went to a good school in louisiana , and later to princeton .
later on i was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basis though you see what it come to now .
my mother died when i was twenty , and my grandfather two years later .
it was rather lonely after that ; and in i married a distant cousin in new orleans .
things might have been different if she lived , but she died when my son denis was born .
then i had only denis .
i did try marriage again , but gave all my time to the boy .
he was like me like all the de russys darkish and tall and thin , and with the devil of a temper .
i gave him the same training my grandfather had give me , but he did need much training when it came to points of honor .
it was in him , i reckon .
never saw such high spirit all i could do to keep him from running away to the spanish war when he was eleven !
romantic young devil , too full of high notions you call victorian , now no trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone .
i sent him to the same school i gone to , and to princeton , too .
he was class of .
in the end he decided to be a doctor , and went a year to the harvard medical school .
then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old french tradition of the family , and argued me into sending him across to the sorbonne .
i did and proudly enough , though i knew how lonely i be with him so far off .
would to god i had !
i thought he was the safest kind of boy to be in paris .
he had a room in the rue jacques that near the university in the quarter ' but according to his letters and his friends he did cut up with the gayer dogs at all .
the people he knew were mostly young fellows from home serious students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking attitudes and painting the town red .
but of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing line between serious studies and the devil .
the aesthetes the decadents , you know .
experiments in life and sensation the baudelaire kind of a chap .
naturally denis ran up against a good many of these , and saw a good deal of their life .
they had all sorts of crazy circles and cults imitation , fake black masses , and the like .
doubt if it did them much harm on the whole probably most of forgot all about it in a year or two .
one of the deepest in this queer stuff was a fellow denis had known at school for that matter , whose father i known myself .
frank marsh , of new orleans .
disciple of lafcadio hearn and gauguin and van gogh regular epitome of the yellow .
poor devil he had the makings of a great artist , at that .
marsh was the oldest friend denis had in paris , so as a matter of course they saw a good deal of each other to talk over old times at clair academy , and all that .
the boy wrote me a good deal about him , and i did see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of mystics marsh ran with .
it seems there was some cult of prehistoric egyptian and carthaginian magic having a rage among the bohemian element on the left bank some nonsensical thing that pretended to reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost african civilisations the great zimbabwe , the dead atlantean cities in the haggar region of the sahara and they had a lot of gibberish concerned with snakes and human hair .
at least , i called it gibberish , then .
denis used to quote marsh as saying odd things about the veiled facts behind the legend of medusa snaky locks and behind the later ptolemaic myth of berenice , who offered up her hair to save her , and had it set in the sky as the constellation coma berenices .
i do think this business made much impression on denis until the night of the queer ritual at marsh rooms when he met the priestess .
most of the devotees of the cult were young fellows , but the head of it was a young woman who called herself ' letting it be known that her real name her name in this latest incarnation , as she put it was marceline bedard .
she claimed to be the daughter of marquis de chameaux , and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an artist model before adopting this more lucrative magical game .
someone said she had lived for a time in the west indies martinique , i think but she was very reticent about herself .
part of her pose was a great show of austerity and holiness , but i do think the more experienced students took that very seriously .
denis , though , was far from experienced , and wrote me fully ten pages of slush about the goddess he had discovered .
if i only realised his simplicity i might have done something , but i never thought a puppy infatuation like could mean much .
i felt absurdly sure that denis ' touchy personal honour and family pride would always keep him out of the most serious complications .
as time went , though , his letters began to make me nervous .
he mentioned this marceline more and more , and his friends less and less , and began talking about the and silly way ' they declined to introduce her to their mothers and sisters .
he seems to have asked her no questions about herself , and i do doubt but that she filled him full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations and the way people slighted her .
at length i could see that denis was altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with his alluring priestess .
at her especial request he never told the old crowd of their continual meetings ; so nobody over there tried to break the affair up .
i suppose she thought he was fabulously rich ; for he had the air of a patrician , and people of a certain class think all aristocratic americans are wealthy .
in any case , she probably thought this a rare chance to contract a genuine alliance with a really eligible young man .
by the time my nervousness burst into open advice , it was too late .
the boy had lawfully married her , and wrote that he was dropping his studies and bringing the woman home to riverside .
he said she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult , and that henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewoman the future mistress of riverside , and mother of de russys to come .
well , sir , i took it the best way i could .
i knew that sophisticated continentals have different standards from our old american ones and anyway , i really knew nothing against the woman .
a charlatan , perhaps , but why necessarily any worse ?
i suppose i tried to keep as naïve as possible about such things in those days , for the boy sake .
clearly , there was nothing for a man of sense to do but let denis alone so long as his new wife conformed to de russy ways .
let her have a chance to prove herself perhaps she would hurt the family as much as some might fear .
so i did raise any objections or ask any penitence .
the thing was done , and i stood ready to welcome the boy back , whatever he brought with him .
they got here three weeks after the telegram telling of marriage .
marceline was beautiful there was no denying that and i could see how the boy might very well get foolish about her .
she did have an air of breeding , and i think to this day she must have had some strains of good blood in her .
she was apparently not much over twenty ; of medium size , fairly slim , and as graceful as a tigress in posture and motion .
her complexion was a deep olive like old ivory and her eyes were large and very dark .
she had small , classically regular features though not quite enough to suit my taste and the most singular braid of jet black hair that i ever saw .
i did wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical cult , for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to her naturally .
coiled up , it made her look like some oriental princess in a drawing of aubrey beardsley .
hanging down her back , it came well below her knees and shone in the light as if it had possessed some separate , unholy vitality of its own .
i would almost have thought of medusa or berenice myself without having such things suggested to me upon seeing and studying that hair .
sometimes i thought it moved slightly of itself , and tended to arrange itself in distinct ropes or strands , but this may have been sheer illusion .
she braided it incessantly , and seemed to use some sort of preparation on it .
i got the notion once a curious , whimsical notion that it was a living being which she had to feed in some strange way .
all nonsense but it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her hair .
for i ca deny that i failed to like her wholly , no matter how hard i tried .
i could tell what the trouble was , but it was there .
something about her repelled me very subtly , and i could not help weaving morbid and macabre associations about everything connected with her .
her complexion called up thoughts of babylon , atlantis , lemuria , and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder world ; her eyes struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature or animal goddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human ; and her hair that dense , exotic , overnourished growth of oily inkiness made one shiver as a great black python might have done .
there was no doubt but that she realised my involuntary attitude though i tried to hide it , and she tried to hide the fact that she noticed it .
yet the boy infatuation lasted .
he positively fawned on her , and overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree .
she appeared to return the feeling , though i could see it took a conscious effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and extravagances .
for one thing , i think she was piqued to learn we were as wealthy as she had expected .
it was a bad business all told .
i could see that sad undercurrents were arising .
denis was with , and began to grow away from me as he felt my shrinking from his wife .
this kind of thing went on for months , and i saw that i was losing my only son the boy who had formed the centre of all my thoughts and acts for the past quarter century .
i own that i felt bitter about it what father would ?
and yet i could do nothing .
marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months , and our friends received her without any quibbling or questioning .
i was always nervous , though , about what some of the young fellows in paris might write home to their relatives after the news of the marriage spread around .
despite the woman love of secrecy , it could remain hidden forever indeed , denis had written a few of his closest friends , in strict confidence , as soon as he was settled with her at riverside .
i got to staying alone in my room more and more , with my failing health as an excuse .
it was about that time that my present spinal neuritis began to develop which made the excuse a pretty good one .
denis did seem to notice the trouble , or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs ; and it hurt me to see how callous he was getting .
i began to get sleepless , and often racked my brain in the night to try to find out what made my new so repulsive and even dimly horrible to me .
it surely was her old mystical nonsense , for she had left all the past behind her and never mentioned it once .
she did even do any painting , although i understood that she had once dabbled in art .
oddly , the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants .
the darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward her , and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our family had left .
these few old scipio and his wife sarah , the cook delilah , and mary , scipio daughter were as civil as possible ; but plainly revealed that their new mistress commanded their duty rather than their affection .
they stayed in their own remote part of the house as much as possible .
mccabe , our white chauffeur , was insolently admiring rather than hostile ; and another exception was a very old zulu woman , said to have been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of family pensioner .
old sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever marceline came near her , and one time i saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had walked .
blacks are superstitious animals , and i wondered whether marceline had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome their evident dislike .
well , that how we went on for nearly half a year .
then , in the summer of , things began to happen .
toward the middle of june denis got a note from his old friend frank marsh , telling of a sort of nervous breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country .
it was postmarked new orleans for marsh had gone home from paris when he felt the collapse coming on and seemed a very plain though polite bid for an invitation from us .
marsh , of course , knew that marceline was here ; and asked very courteously after her .
denis was sorry to hear of his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit .
marsh came and i was shocked to notice how he had changed since i had seen him in his earlier days .
he was a smallish , lightish fellow , with blue eyes and an undecided chin ; and now i could see the effects of drink and i do know what else in his puffy eyelids , enlarged , and heavy lines around the mouth .
i reckon he had taken his dose of decadence pretty seriously , and set out to be as much of a rimbaud , baudelaire , or lautreamont as he could .
and yet he was delightful to talk to for like all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the color and atmosphere and names of things ; admirably , thoroughly alive , and with whole records of conscious experience in obscure , shadowy fields of living and feeling which most of us pass over without knowing they exist .
poor young devil if only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand !
there was great stuff in the boy !
i was glad of the visit , for i felt it would help to set up a normal atmosphere in the house again .
and that what it really seemed to do at first ; for as i said , marsh was a delight to have around .
he was as sincere and profound an artist as i ever saw in my life , and i certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the perception and expression of beauty .
when he saw an exquisite thing , or was creating one , his eyes would dilate until the light irises were nearly out of sight leaving two mystical black pits in that weak , delicate , face ; black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess about .
when he reached here , though , he did have many chances to shew this tendency ; for he had , as he told denis , gone quite stale .
it seems he had been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind like fuseli or goya or sime or clark ashton smith but had suddenly become played out .
the world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he could recognize as beauty beauty , that is , of enough force and poignancy to arouse his creative faculty .
he had often been this way before all decadents are but this time he could not invent any new , strange , or outré sensation or experience which would supply the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy .
he was like a durtal or a des esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbit .
marceline was away when marsh arrived .
she had been enthusiastic about his coming , and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our friends in louis which came about that time for her and denis .
denis , of course , stayed to receive his guest ; but marceline had gone on alone .
it was the first time they had ever been separated , and i hoped the interval would help to dispel the daze that was making such a fool of the boy .
marceline shewed no hurry to get back , but seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could .
denis stood it better than one would have expected from such a doting husband , and seemed more like his old self as he talked over other days with marsh and tried to cheer the listless aesthete up .
it was marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman ; perhaps because he thought her strange beauty , or some phase of the mysticism which had gone into her magical cult , might help to reawaken his interest in things and give him another start toward artistic creation .
that there was no baser reason , i was absolutely certain from what i knew of marsh character .
with all his weaknesses , he was a gentleman and it had indeed relieved me when i first learned that he wanted to come here because his willingness to accept denis ' hospitality proved that there was no reason why he should .
when , at last , marceline did return , i could see that marsh was tremendously affected .
he did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre thing which she had so definitely abandoned , but was unable to hide a powerful admiration which kept his eyes now dilated in that curious way for the first time during his visit riveted to her every moment she was in the room .
she , however , seemed uneasy rather than pleased by his steady scrutiny that is , she seemed so at first , though this feeling of hers wore away in a few days , and left the two on a basis of the most cordial and voluble congeniality .
i could see marsh studying her constantly when he thought no one was watching ; and i wondered how long it would be that only the artist , and not the primitive man , would be aroused by her mysterious graces .
denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs ; though he realised that his guest was a man of honour and that , as kindred mystics and aesthetes , marceline and marsh would naturally have things and interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person could have no part .
he did hold anything against anybody , but merely regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to let him talk with marceline as marsh talked .
at this stage of things i began to see more of the boy .
with his wife otherwise busy , he had time to remember that he had a father and a father who was ready to help him in any sort of perplexity or difficulty .
we often sat together on the veranda watching marsh and marceline as they rode up or down the drive on horseback , or played tennis on the court that used to stretch south of the house .
they talked mostly in french , which marsh , though he had more than a of french blood , handled more glibly than either denis or i could speak it .
marceline english , always academically correct , was rapidly improving in accent ; but it was plain that she relished dropping back into her .
as we looked at the congenial couple they made , i could see the boy cheek and throat muscles tighten though he was a whit less ideal a host to marsh , or a whit less considerate husband to marceline .
all this was generally in the afternoon ; for marceline rose very late , had breakfast in bed , and took an immense amount of time preparing to come downstairs .
i never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics , beauty exercises , , unguents , and everything of that kind .
it was in these morning hours that denis and marsh did their real visiting , and exchanged the close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy imposed .
well , it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made the proposition which brought on the end .
i was laid up with some of my neuritis , but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlour sofa near the long window .
denis and marsh were just outside ; so i could help hearing all they said .
they had been talking about art , and the curious , capricious elements needed to jolt an artist into producing the real article , when marsh suddenly swerved from abstractions to the personal application he must have had in mind from the start .
' i suppose , ' he was saying , nobody can tell just what it is in some scenes or objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain individuals .
basically , of course , it must have some reference to each man background of mental associations , for no two people have the same scale of sensitiveness and responses .
we decadents are artists for whom all ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or imaginative significance , but no one of us responds in the same way to exactly the same extraordinary .
now take me , for instance . '
he paused and resumed .
' i know , denny , that i can say these things to you because you such a preternaturally unspoiled mind clean , fine , direct , objective , and all that .
you wo misunderstand as an oversubtilised , effete man of the world might . '
he paused once more .
fact is , i think i know what needed to set my imagination working again .
i had a dim idea of it ever since we were in paris , but i sure now .
it marceline , old chap that face and that hair , and the train of shadowy images they bring up .
not merely visible beauty though god knows there enough of that but something peculiar and individualised , that ca exactly be explained .
do you know , in the last few days i felt the existence of such a stimulus so keenly that i honestly think i could outdo myself break into the real masterpiece class if i could get ahold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and hair set my fancy stirring and weaving .
there something weird and about it something joined up with the dim ancient thing marceline represents .
i do know how much she told you about that side of her , but i can assure you there plenty of it .
she has some marvellous links with the outside . '
some change in denis ' expression must have halted the speaker here , for there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on .
i was utterly taken aback , for i expected no such overt development like this ; and i wondered what my son could be thinking .
my heart began to pound violently , and i strained my ears in the frankest of intentional eavesdropping .
then marsh resumed .
course you jealous i know how a speech like mine must sound but i can swear to you that you need be . '
denis did not answer , and marsh went '
to tell the truth , i could never be in love with marceline i could even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense .
why , damn it all , i felt like a hypocrite talking with her these days as i been doing .
case simply is , that one of her phase of her half hyponotises me in a certain way a very strange , fantastic , and dimly terrible way just as another phase half hypnotises you in a much more normal way .
i see something in her or to be psychologically exact , something through her or beyond her that you did see at all .
something that brings up a vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses , and makes me want to paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant i try to envisage them clearly .
do mistake , denny , your wife is a magnificent being , a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called divine if anything on earth has ! '
i felt a clearing of the situation at this point , for the abstract strangeness of marsh statement , plus the flattery he was now heaping on marceline , could not fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his consort as denis always was .
marsh evidently caught the change himself , for there was more confidence in his tone as he continued .
' i must paint her , denny must paint that hair and you wo regret .
there something more than mortal about that hair something more than beautiful ' he paused , and i wondered what denis could be thinking .
i wondered , indeed , what i was really thinking myself .
was marsh interest actually that of the artist alone , or was he merely infatuated as denis had been ?
i had thought , in their schooldays , that he had envied my boy ; and i dimly felt that it might be the same now .
on the other hand , something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung amazingly true ; so that the more i pondered , the more i was inclined to take the stuff at face value .
denis seemed to do so , too , for although i could not catch his reply , i could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been affirmative .
there was a sound of someone slapping another on the back , and then a grateful speech from marsh that i was long to remember .
great , denny , and just as i told you , you never regret it .
in a sense , i half doing it for you .
you be a different man when you see it .
i put you back where you used to be give you a and a sort of salvation but you ca see what i mean as yet .
just remember old friendship , and do get the idea that i not the same old bird ! '
i rose perplexedly as i saw the two stroll off across the lawn , arm in arm , and smoking in unison .
what could marsh have meant by his strange and almost ominous reassurance ?
the more my fears were quieted in one direction , the more they were aroused in another .
