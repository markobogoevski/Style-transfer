this place commands my patience , or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour me .
think not , although in writing i preferr the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes , that therefore i have forged , or am not able verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen no , prelate , such is thy audacious wickedness , thy lewd , pestiferous and dissentious pranks , as very infants prattle of thy pride .
thou art a most pernicious usurer , forward by nature , enemy to peace , lascivious , wanton , more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree , and for thy treachery , what more manifest ?
in that thou a trap to take my life , as well at london bridge as at the tower .
beside , i fear me , if thy thoughts were sifted , the king , thy sovereign , is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart .
bishop gloucester , i do defy thee .
lords , vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply .
if i were covetous , ambitious or perverse , as he will have me , how am i so poor ?
or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself , but keep my wonted calling ?
and for dissension , who preferreth peace more than i do ? except i be provoked .
no , my good lords , it is not that offends , it is not that that hath incensed the duke it is , because no one should sway but he , no one but he should be about the king , and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth .
but he shall know i am as good as good !
thou bastard of my grandfather !
bishop ay , lordly sir , for what are you , i pray , but one imperious in another throne ?
am i not protector , saucy priest ?
bishop and am not i a prelate of the church ?
yes , as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft .
bishop unreverent gloster !
thou art reverent touching thy spiritual function , not thy life .
bishop rome shall remedy this .
roam thither , then .
my lord , it were your duty to forbear .
ay , see the bishop be not overborne .
methinks my lord should be religious and know the office that belongs to such .
methinks his lordship should be humbler , it fitteth not a prelate so to plead .
yes , when his holy state is touch so near .
state holy or unhallow , what of that ?
is not his grace protector to the king ?
richard aside plantagenet , i see , must hold his tongue , lest it be said , sirrah , when you should , must your bold verdict enter talk with lords ? '
else would i have a fling at winchester .
uncles of gloucester and of winchester , the special watchmen of our english weal , i would prevail , if prayers might prevail , to join your hearts in love and amity .
o , what a scandal is it to our crown , that two such noble peers as ye should jar !
believe me , lords , my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth .
a noise within , with the ! '
what tumult this ?
an uproar , i dare warrant , begun through malice of the bishop men .
a noise again , !
stones ! '
enter mayor o , my good lords , and virtuous henry , pity the city of london , pity us !
the bishop and the duke of gloucester men , forbidden late to carry any weapon , have fill their pockets full of pebble stones and banding themselves in contrary parts do pelt so fast at one another pate that many have their giddy brains knock out our windows are broke down in every street and we for fear compell to shut our shops .
enter , in skirmish , with bloody pates we charge you , on allegiance to ourself , to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace .
pray , uncle gloucester , mitigate this strife .
first nay , if we be forbidden stones , we fall to it with our teeth .
second do what ye dare , we are as resolute .
skirmish again you of my household , leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustom fight aside .
third my lord , we know your grace to be a man just and upright , and , for your royal birth , inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince , so kind a father of the commonweal , to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate , we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes .
first ay , and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead .
begin again stay , stay , i say !
and if you love me , as you say you do , let me persuade you to forbear awhile .
o , how this discord doth afflict my soul !
can you , my lord of winchester , behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent ?
who should be pitiful , if you be not ?
or who should study to prefer a peace .
if holy churchmen take delight in broils ?
yield , my lord protector , yield , winchester , except you mean with obstinate repulse to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm .
you see what mischief and what murder too hath been enacted through your enmity , then be at peace except ye thirst for blood .
bishop he shall submit , or i will never yield .
compassion on the king commands me stoop , or i would see his heart out , ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me .
behold , my lord of winchester , the duke hath banish moody discontented fury , as by his smoothed brows it doth appear why look you still so stern and tragical ?
here , winchester , i offer thee my hand .
fie , uncle beaufort !
i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin , and will not you maintain the thing you teach , but prove a chief offender in the same ?
sweet king !
the bishop hath a kindly gird .
for shame , my lord of winchester , relent !
what , shall a child instruct you what to do ?
bishop well , duke of gloucester , i will yield to thee , love for thy love and hand for hand i give .
aside ay , but , i fear me , with a hollow see here , my friends and loving countrymen , this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers so help me god , as i dissemble not !
bishop aside so help me god , as i intend it not !
o , loving uncle , kind duke of gloucester , how joyful am i made by this contract !
away , my masters !
trouble us no more , but join in friendship , as your lords have done .
first content i to the surgeon .
second and so will i .
third and i will see what physic the tavern affords .
exeunt , mayor , and c accept this scroll , most gracious sovereign , which in the right of richard plantagenet we do exhibit to your majesty .
well urged , my lord of warwick or sweet prince , and if your grace mark every circumstance , you have great reason to do richard right , especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty .
and those occasions , uncle , were of force therefore , my loving lords , our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood .
let richard be restored to his blood , so shall his father wrongs be recompensed .
bishop as will the rest , so willeth winchester .
if richard will be true , not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york , from whence you spring by lineal descent .
richard thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death .
stoop then and set your knee against my foot , and , in reguerdon of that duty done , i gird thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard , like a true plantagenet , and rise created princely duke of york .
richard and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall !
and as my duty springs , so perish they that grudge one thought against your majesty !
welcome , high prince , the mighty duke of york !
aside perish , base prince , ignoble duke of york !
now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crown in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends , as it disanimates his enemies .
when gloucester says the word , king henry goes , for friendly counsel cuts off many foes .
your ships already are in readiness .
sennet .
flourish .
exeunt all but exeter ay , we may march in england or in france , not seeing what is likely to ensue .
this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forged love and will at last break out into a flame as fester members rot but by degree , till bones and flesh and sinews fall away , so will this base and envious discord breed .
and now i fear that fatal prophecy which in the time of henry named the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe , that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor lose all which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time .

our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city , and we be lords and rulers over rouen , therefore we knock .

here enter pucelle and her practisants , now she is there , how will she specify where is the best and safest passage in ?
by thrusting out a torch from yonder tower , which , once discern , shows that her meaning is , no way to that , for weakness , which she enter .
enter joan la pucelle on the top , thrusting out a torch burning behold , this is the happy wedding torch that joineth rouen unto her countrymen , but burning fatal to the talbotites !
exit see , noble charles , the beacon of our friend , the burning torch in yonder turret stands .

want ye corn for bread ?
i think the duke of burgundy will fast before he buy again at such a rate was full of darnel , do you like the taste ?
scoff on , vile fiend and shameless courtezan !
i trust ere long to choke thee with thine own and make thee curse the harvest of that corn .
your grace may starve perhaps before that time .
o , let no words , but deeds , revenge this treason !
what will you do , good ?
break a lance , and run a tilt at death within a chair ?
foul fiend of france , and hag of all despite , encompass with thy lustful paramours !
becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age and twit with cowardice a man half dead ?
damsel , i have a bout with you again , or else let talbot perish with this shame .
are ye so hot , sir ?
yet , pucelle , hold thy peace , if talbot do but thunder , rain will follow .
the english whisper together in council god speed the parliament !
who shall be the speaker ?
dare ye come forth and meet us in the field ?
belike your lordship takes us then for fools , to try if that our own be ours or no .
i speak not to that railing hecate , but unto thee , alencon , and the rest , will ye , like soldiers , come and fight it out ?
signior , no .
signior , hang !
base muleters of france !
like peasant do they keep the walls and dare not take up arms like gentlemen .
away , captains !
let get us from the walls , for talbot means no goodness by his looks .
god be wi ' you , my lord !
we came but to tell you that we are here .
exeunt from the walls and there will we be too , ere it be long , or else reproach be talbot greatest fame !
vow , burgundy , by honour of thy house , prick on by public wrongs sustain in france , either to get the town again or die and i , as sure as english henry lives and as his father here was conqueror , as sure as in this town great heart was buried , so sure i swear to get the town or die .
my vows are equal partners with thy vows .
but , ere we go , regard this dying prince , the valiant duke of bedford .
come , my lord , we will bestow you in some better place , fitter for sickness and for crazy age .
lord talbot , do not so dishonour me here will i sit before the walls of rouen and will be partner of your weal or woe .
courageous bedford , let us now persuade you .
not to be gone from hence , for once i read that stout pendragon in his litter sick came to the field and vanquished his foes methinks i should revive the soldiers ' hearts , because i ever found them as myself .
undaunted spirit in a dying breast !
then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe !
and now no more ado , brave burgundy , but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy .
exeunt all but bedford and attendants an alarum excursions .
enter fastolfe and a captain whither away , sir john fastolfe , in such haste ?
whither away !
to save myself by flight we are like to have the overthrow again .

exit cowardly knight !
ill fortune follow thee !
exit retreat excursions .
joan la pucelle , alencon , and charles fly now , quiet soul , depart when heaven please , for i have seen our enemies ' overthrow .
what is the trust or strength of foolish man ?
they that of late were daring with their scoffs are glad and fain by flight to save themselves .
bedford dies , and is carried in by two in his chair an alarum .
talbot , burgundy , and the rest lost , and recover in a day again !
this is a double honour , burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory !
warlike and martial talbot , burgundy enshrines thee in his heart and there erects thy noble deeds as valour monuments .
thanks , gentle duke .
but where is pucelle now ?
i think her old familiar is asleep now where the bastard braves , and charles his gleeks ?
what , all amort ?
rouen hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled .
now will we take some order in the town , placing therein some expert officers , and then depart to paris to the king , for there young henry with his nobles lie .
what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy .
but yet , before we go , let not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased , but see his exequies fulfill in rouen a braver soldier never couched lance , a gentler heart did never sway in court , but kings and mightiest potentates must die , for that the end of human misery .
exeunt scene iii .
the plains near rouen .
enter charles , the bastard of orleans , alencon , joan la pucelle , and forces dismay not , princes , at this accident , nor grieve that rouen is so recovered care is no cure , but rather corrosive , for things that are not to be remedied .
let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail , we pull his plumes and take away his train , if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled .
we have been guided by thee hitherto , and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust .
search out thy wit for secret policies , and we will make thee famous through the world .
we set thy statue in some holy place , and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint employ thee then , sweet virgin , for our good .
then thus it must be , this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mix with sugar words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us .
ay , marry , sweeting , if we could do that , france were no place for henry warriors , nor should that nation boast it so with us , but be extirped from our provinces .
for ever should they be expulsed from france and not have title of an earldom here .
your honours shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wished end .
drum sounds afar off hark !
by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto .
here sound an english march .
enter , and pass over at a distance , talbot and his forces there goes the talbot , with his colours spread , and all the troops of english after him .
french march .
enter burgundy and forces now in the rearward comes the duke and his fortune in favour makes him lag behind .
summon a parley , we will talk with him .
trumpets sound a parley a parley with the duke of burgundy !
who craves a parley with the burgundy ?
the princely charles of france , thy countryman .
what thou , charles ?
for i am marching hence .
speak , pucelle , and enchant him with thy words .
brave burgundy , undoubted hope of france !
stay , let thy humble handmaid speak to thee .
speak on , but be not .
look on thy country , look on fertile france , and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe .
as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes , see , see the pining malady of france , behold the wounds , the most unnatural wounds , which thou thyself hast given her woful breast .
o , turn thy edged sword another way , strike those that hurt , and hurt not those that help .
one drop of blood drawn from thy country bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears , and wash away thy country stained spots .
either she hath bewitch me with her words , or nature makes me suddenly relent .
besides , all french and france exclaims on thee , doubting thy birth and lawful progeny .
who thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit sake ?
when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashion thee that instrument of ill , who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive ?
call we to mind , and mark but this for proof , was not the duke of orleans thy foe ?
and was he not in england prisoner ?
but when they heard he was thine enemy , they set him free without his ransom paid , in spite of burgundy and all his friends .
see , then , thou against thy countrymen and with them will be thy slaughtermen .
come , come , return , return , thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms .
i am vanquished , these haughty words of hers have batter me like roaring , and made me almost yield upon my knees .
forgive me , country , and sweet countrymen , and , lords , accept this hearty kind embrace my forces and my power of men are yours so farewell , talbot , i no longer trust thee .
aside done like a frenchman turn , and turn again !
welcome , brave duke !
thy friendship makes us fresh .
and doth beget new courage in our breasts .
pucelle hath bravely play her part in this , and doth deserve a coronet of gold .
now let us on , my lords , and join our powers , and seek how we may prejudice the foe .

kneels is this the lord talbot , uncle gloucester , that hath so long been resident in france ?
yes , if it please your majesty , my liege .
welcome , brave captain and victorious lord !
when i was young , as yet i am not old , i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword .
long since we were resolved of your truth , your faithful service and your toil in war , yet never have you tasted our reward , or been reguerdon with so much as thanks , because till now we never saw your face therefore , stand up , and , for these good deserts , we here create you earl of shrewsbury , and in our coronation take your place .
sennet .

exeunt all but vernon and basset now , sir , to you , that were so hot at sea , disgracing of these colours that i wear in honour of my noble lord of york darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest ?
yes , sir , as well as you dare patronage the envious barking of your saucy tongue against my lord the duke of somerset .
sirrah , thy lord i honour as he is .
why , what is he ?
as good a man as york .
hark ye , not so in witness , take ye that .
strikes him villain , thou the law of arms is such that whoso draws a sword , is present death , or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood .
but i unto his majesty , and crave i may have liberty to venge this wrong , when thou shalt see i meet thee to thy cost .
well , miscreant , i be there as soon as you , and , after , meet you sooner than you would .
exeunt act iv scene paris .
a hall of state .
enter king henry vi , gloucester , bishop of winchester , york , suffolk , somerset , warwick , talbot , exeter , the governor , of paris , and others lord bishop , set the crown upon his head .
bishop god save king henry , of that name the sixth !
now , governor of paris , take your oath , that you elect no other king but him , esteem none friends but such as are his friends , and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practises against his state this shall ye do , so help you righteous god !
enter fastolfe my gracious sovereign , as i rode from calais , to haste unto your coronation , a letter was deliver to my hands , writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy .
shame to the duke of burgundy and thee !
i vow , base knight , when i did meet thee next , to tear the garter from thy craven leg , plucking it off which i have done , because unworthily thou wast installed in that high degree .
pardon me , princely henry , and the rest this dastard , at the battle of patay , when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one , before we met or that a stroke was given , like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men , myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners .
then judge , great lords , if i have done amiss , or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood , yea or no .
to say the truth , this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man , much more a knight , a captain and a leader .
when first this order was ordain , my lords , knights of the garter were of noble birth , valiant and virtuous , full of haughty courage , such as were grown to credit by the wars , not fearing death , nor shrinking for distress , but always resolute in most extremes .
he then that is not furnish in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight , profaning this most honourable order , and should , if i were worthy to be judge , be quite degraded , like a swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood .
stain to thy countrymen , thou thy doom !
be packing , therefore , thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee , on pain of death .
exit fastolfe and now , my lord protector , view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy .
what means his grace , that he hath changed his style ?
no more but , plain and bluntly , the king ! '
hath he forgot he is his sovereign ?
or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will ?
what here ?
reads ' i have , upon especial cause , moved with compassion of my country wreck , together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon , forsaken your pernicious faction and join with charles , the rightful king of france . '
o monstrous treachery !
can this be so , that in alliance , amity and oaths , there should be found such false dissembling guile ?
what !
doth my uncle burgundy revolt ?
he doth , my lord , and is become your foe .
is that the worst this letter doth contain ?
it is the worst , and all , my lord , he writes .
why , then , lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse .
how say you , my lord ?
are you not content ?
content , my liege !
yes , but that i am prevented , i should have begg i might have been employ .
then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offence it is to flout his friends .
i go , my lord , in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes .
exit enter vernon and basset grant me the combat , gracious sovereign .
and me , my lord , grant me the combat too .
this is my servant hear him , noble prince .
and this is mine sweet henry , favour him .
be patient , lords , and give them leave to speak .
say , gentlemen , what makes you thus exclaim ?
and wherefore crave you combat ?
or with whom ?
with him , my lord , for he hath done me wrong .
and i with him , for he hath done me wrong .
what is that wrong whereof you both complain ?
first let me know , and then i answer you .
