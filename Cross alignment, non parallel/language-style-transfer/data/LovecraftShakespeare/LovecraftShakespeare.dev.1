none but friends say boldly .
so , haply , are they friends to antony .
he needs as many , sir , as caesar has , or needs not us .
if caesar please , our master will leap to be his friend for us , you know , whose he is we are , and that is , caesar .
so .
thus then , thou most renown caesar entreats , not to consider in what case thou , further than he is caesar .
go on right royal .
he knows that you embrace not antony as you did love , but as you fear him .
o !
the scars upon your honour , therefore , he does pity , as constrained blemishes , not as deserved .
he is a god , and knows what is most right mine honour was not yielded , but conquer merely .
aside to be sure of that , i will ask antony .
sir , sir , thou art so leaky , that we must leave thee to thy sinking , for thy dearest quit thee .
exit shall i say to caesar what you require of him ?
for he partly begs to be desired to give .
it much would please him , that of his fortunes you should make a staff to lean upon but it would warm his spirits , to hear from me you had left antony , and put yourself under his shrowd , the universal landlord .
what your name ?
my name is thyreus .
most kind messenger , say to great caesar this in deputation i kiss his conquering hand tell him , i am prompt to lay my crown at feet , and there to kneel tell him from his breath i hear the doom of egypt .
is your noblest course .
wisdom and fortune combating together , if that the former dare but what it can , no chance may shake it .
give me grace to lay my duty on your hand .
your caesar father oft , when he hath mused of taking kingdoms in , bestow his lips on that unworthy place , as it rain kisses .
mark antony and domitius enobarbus favours , by jove that thunders !
what art thou , fellow ?
one that but performs the bidding of the fullest man , and worthiest to have command obey .
aside you will be whipp .
approach , there !
ah , you kite !
now , gods and devils !
authority melts from me of late , when i cried ! '
like boys unto a muss , kings would start forth , and cry will ? '
have you no ears ?
i am antony yet .
enter attendants take hence this jack , and whip him .
aside is better playing with a lion whelp than with an old one dying .
moon and stars !
whip him .
twenty of the greatest tributaries that do acknowledge caesar , should i find them so saucy with the hand of she here , what her name , since she was cleopatra ?
whip him , fellows , till , like a boy , you see him cringe his face , and whine aloud for mercy take him hence .
mark antony !
tug him away being whipp , bring him again this jack of caesar shall bear us an errand to him .
exeunt attendants with thyreus you were half blasted ere i knew you ha !
have i my pillow left unpress in rome , forborne the getting of a lawful race , and by a gem of women , to be abused by one that looks on feeders ?
good my lord , you have been a boggler ever but when we in our viciousness grow hard o misery o ! the wise gods seel our eyes , in our own filth drop our clear judgments , make us adore our errors , laugh at , while we strut to our confusion .
o , come to this ?
i found you as a morsel cold upon dead caesar trencher , nay , you were a fragment of cneius pompey , besides what hotter hours , unregister in vulgar fame , you have luxuriously pick out for , i am sure , though you can guess what temperance should be , you know not what it is .
wherefore is this ?
to let a fellow that will take rewards and say quit you ! '
be familiar with my playfellow , your hand , this kingly seal and plighter of high hearts !
o , that i were upon the hill of basan , to outroar the horned herd !
for i have savage cause , and to proclaim it civilly , were like a halter neck which does the hangman thank for being yare about him .
attendants with thyreus is he whipp ?
soundly , my lord .
cried he ?
and begg a ' pardon ?
he did ask favour .
if that thy father live , let him repent thou wast not made his daughter , and be thou sorry to follow caesar in his triumph , since thou hast been whipp for following him henceforth the white hand of a lady fever thee , shake thou to look on .
get thee back to caesar , tell him thy entertainment look , thou say he makes me angry with him , for he seems proud and disdainful , harping on what i am , not what he knew i was he makes me angry , and at this time most easy is to , when my good stars , that were my former guides , have empty left their orbs , and shot their fires into the abysm of hell .
if he mislike my speech and what is done , tell him he has hipparchus , my enfranched bondman , whom he may at pleasure whip , or hang , or torture , as he shall like , to quit me urge it thou hence with thy stripes , begone !
exit thyreus have you done yet ?
alack , our terrene moon is now eclipsed , and it portends alone the fall of antony !
i must stay his time .
to flatter caesar , would you mingle eyes with one that ties his points ?
not know me yet ?
toward me ?
ah , dear , if i be so , from my cold heart let heaven engender hail , and poison it in the source , and the first stone drop in my neck as it determines , so dissolve my life !
the next caesarion smite !
till by degrees the memory of my womb , together with my brave egyptians all , by the discandying of this pelleted storm , lie graveless , till the flies and gnats of nile have buried them for prey !
i am satisfied .
caesar sits down in alexandria , where i will oppose his fate .
our force by land hath nobly held , our sever navy too have knit again , and fleet , threatening most .
where hast thou been , my heart ?
dost thou hear , lady ?
if from the field i shall return once more to kiss these lips , i will appear in blood , i and my sword will earn our chronicle there hope i yet .
that my brave lord !
i will be , hearted , breathed , and fight maliciously for when mine hours were nice and lucky , men did ransom lives of me for jests , but now i set my teeth , and send to darkness all that stop me .
come , let have one other gaudy night call to me all my sad captains , fill our bowls once more , let mock the midnight bell .
it is my i had thought to have held it poor but , since my lord is antony again , i will be cleopatra .
we will yet do well .
call all his noble captains to my lord .
do so , we speak to them , and i force the wine peep through their scars .
come on , my queen , there sap i yet .
the next time i do fight , i make death love me , for i will contend even with his pestilent scythe .
exeunt all but domitius enobarbus now he outstare the lightning .
to be furious , is to be frighted out of fear , and in that mood the dove will peck the estridge , and i see still , a diminution in our captain brain restores his heart when valour preys on reason , it eats the sword it fights with .
i will seek some way to leave him .

i am dying , egypt , dying , only i here importune death awhile , until of many thousand kisses the poor last i lay up thy lips .
i dare not , dear , dear my lord , pardon , i dare not , lest i be taken not the imperious show of the caesar ever shall be brooch with me , if knife , drugs , serpents , have edge , sting , or operation , i am safe your wife octavia , with her modest eyes and still conclusion , shall acquire no honour demuring upon me .
but come , come , antony , help me , my women , we must draw thee up assist , good friends .
o , quick , or i am gone .

how heavy weighs my lord !
our strength is all gone into heaviness , that makes the weight had i great juno power , the mercury should fetch thee up , and set thee by jove side .
yet come a little , wishes were ever fools , o , come , come , come , they heave mark antony aloft to cleopatra and welcome , welcome !

a heavy sight !
i am dying , egypt , dying give me some wine , and let me speak a little .

o !
they do not go together .
gentle , hear me none about caesar trust but proculeius .
my resolution and my hands i trust , none about caesar .
the miserable change now at my end lament nor sorrow at , but please your thoughts in feeding them with those my former fortunes wherein i lived , the greatest prince o ' the world , the noblest , and do now not basely die , not cowardly put off my helmet to my countryman , a roman by a roman valiantly vanquish .
now my spirit is going , i can no more .
noblest of men , die ?
hast thou no care of me ?
shall i abide in this dull world , which in thy absence is no better than a sty ?
o , see , my women , mark antony dies the crown o ' the earth doth melt .
my lord !
o , wither is the garland of the war , the soldier pole is young boys and girls are level now with men , the odds is gone , and there is nothing left remarkable beneath the visiting moon .

she is dead too , our sovereign .
lady !
madam !
o madam , madam , madam !
royal egypt , empress !
peace , peace , iras !
no more , but a woman , and commanded by such poor passion as the maid that milks and does the meanest chares .
it were for me to throw my sceptre at the injurious gods , to tell them that this world did equal theirs till they had our jewel .
all but naught , patience is scottish , and impatience does become a dog that mad then is it sin to rush into the secret house of death , ere death dare come to us ?
how do you , women ?
what , what !
good cheer !
why , how now , charmian !
my noble girls !
ah , women , women , look , our lamp is spent , it out !
good sirs , take heart we bury him , and then , what brave , what noble , let do it after the high roman fashion , and make death proud to take us .

exeunt , those above bearing off mark antony body act v scene alexandria .
octavius caesar camp .
enter octavius caesar , agrippa , dolabella , mecaenas , gallus , proculeius , and others , his council of war go to him , dolabella , bid him yield , being so frustrate , tell him he mocks the pauses that he makes .
caesar , i shall .
exit enter dercetas , with the sword of mark antony wherefore is that ?
and what art thou that darest appear thus to us ?
i am call dercetas , mark antony i served , who best was worthy best to be served whilst he stood up and spoke , he was my master , and i wore my life to spend upon his haters .
if thou please to take me to thee , as i was to him i be to caesar , if thou pleasest not , i yield thee up my life .
what thou ?
i say , o caesar , antony is dead .
the breaking of so great a thing should make a greater crack the round world should have shook lions into civil streets , and citizens to their dens the death of antony is not a single doom , in the name lay a moiety of the world .
he is dead , caesar not by a public minister of justice , nor by a hired knife , but that self hand , which writ his honour in the acts it did , hath , with the courage which the heart did lend it , splitted the heart .
this is his sword , i robb his wound of it , behold it stain with his most noble blood .
look you sad , friends ?
the gods rebuke me , but it is tidings to wash the eyes of kings .
and strange it is , that nature must compel us to lament our most persisted deeds .
his taints and honours waged equal with him .
a rarer spirit never did steer humanity but you , gods , will give us some faults to make us men .
caesar is touch .
when such a spacious mirror set before him , he needs must see himself .
o antony !
i have follow thee to this , but we do lance diseases in our bodies i must perforce have shown to thee such a declining day , or look on thine , we could not stall together in the whole world but yet let me lament , with tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts , that thou , my brother , my competitor in top of all design , my mate in empire , friend and companion in the front of war , the arm of mine own body , and the heart where mine his thoughts did kindle , that our stars , unreconciliable , should divide our equalness to this .
hear me , good friends but i will tell you at some meeter season enter an egyptian the business of this man looks out of him , we hear him what he says .
whence are you ?
a poor egyptian yet .
the queen my mistress , confined in all she has , her monument , of thy intents desires instruction , that she preparedly may frame herself to the way she forced to .
bid her have good heart she soon shall know of us , by some of ours , how honourable and how kindly we determine for her , for caesar can not live to be ungentle .
so the gods preserve thee !
exit come hither , proculeius .
go and say , we purpose her no shame give her what comforts the quality of her passion shall require , lest , in her greatness , by some mortal stroke she do defeat us , for her life in rome would be eternal in our triumph go , and with your speediest bring us what she says , and how you find of her .
caesar , i shall .
exit gallus , go you along .
exit gallus where dolabella , to second proculeius ?
dolabella !
let him alone , for i remember now how he employ he shall in time be ready .
go with me to my tent , where you shall see how hardly i was drawn into this war , how calm and gentle i proceeded still in all my writings go with me , and see what i can show in this .
exeunt scene ii .
alexandria .
a room in the monument .
enter cleopatra , charmian , and iras my desolation does begin to make a better life .
is paltry to be caesar , not being fortune , he but fortune knave , a minister of her will and it is great to do that thing that ends all other deeds , which shackles accidents and bolts up change , which sleeps , and never palates more the dug , the beggar nurse and caesar .
enter , to the gates of the monument , proculeius , gallus and soldiers caesar sends greeting to the queen of egypt , and bids thee study on what fair demands thou to have him grant thee .
what thy name ?
my name is proculeius .
antony did tell me of you , bade me trust you , but i do not greatly care to be deceived , that have no use for trusting .
if your master would have a queen his beggar , you must tell him , that majesty , to keep decorum , must no less beg than a kingdom if he please to give me conquer egypt for my son , he gives me so much of mine own , as i will kneel to him with thanks .
be of good cheer , you into a princely hand , fear nothing make your full reference freely to my lord , who is so full of grace , that it flows over on all that need let me report to him your sweet dependency , and you shall find a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness , where he for grace is kneel to .
pray you , tell him i am his fortune vassal , and i send him the greatness he has got .
i hourly learn a doctrine of obedience , and would gladly look him i ' the face .
this i report , dear lady .
have comfort , for i know your plight is pitied of him that caused it .
you see how easily she may be surprised here proculeius and two of the guard ascend the monument by a ladder placed against a window , and , having descended , come behind cleopatra .
some of the guard unbar and open the gates to proculeius and the guard guard her till caesar come .
exit royal queen !
o cleopatra !
thou art taken , queen quick , quick , good hands .
drawing a dagger hold , worthy lady , hold seizes and disarms her do not yourself such wrong , who are in this relieved , but not betray .
what , of death too , that rids our dogs of languish ?
cleopatra , do not abuse my master bounty by the undoing of yourself let the world see his nobleness well acted , which your death will never let come forth .
where art thou , death ?
come hither , come !
come , come , and take a queen worthy many babes and beggars !
o , temperance , lady !
sir , i will eat no meat , i not drink , sir , if idle talk will once be necessary , i not sleep neither this mortal house i ruin , do caesar what he can .
know , sir , that i will not wait pinion at your master court , nor once be chastised with the sober eye of dull octavia .
shall they hoist me up and show me to the shouting varletry of censuring rome ?
rather a ditch in egypt be gentle grave unto me !
rather on nilus ' mud lay me stark naked , and let the blow me into abhorring !
rather make my country high pyramides my gibbet , and hang me up in chains !
you do extend these thoughts of horror further than you shall find cause in caesar .
enter dolabella proculeius , what thou hast done thy master caesar knows , and he hath sent for thee for the queen , i take her to my guard .
so , dolabella , it shall content me best be gentle to her .
to cleopatra to caesar i will speak what you shall please , if you employ me to him .
say , i would die .
exeunt proculeius and soldiers most noble empress , you have heard of me ?
i can not tell .
assuredly you know me .
no matter , sir , what i have heard or known .
you laugh when boys or women tell their dreams , not your trick ?
i understand not , madam .
i dream there was an emperor antony o , such another sleep , that i might see but such another man !
if it might please ye , his face was as the heavens , and therein stuck a sun and moon , which kept their course , and lighted the little o , the earth .
most sovereign creature , his legs bestrid the ocean his rear arm crested the world his voice was propertied as all the tuned spheres , and that to friends , but when he meant to quail and shake the orb , he was as rattling thunder .
for his bounty , there was no winter i , an autumn was that grew the more by reaping his delights were , they show his back above the element they lived in in his livery walk crowns and crownets , realms and islands were as plates dropp from his pocket .
cleopatra !
think you there was , or might be , such a man as this i dream of ?
gentle madam , no .
you lie , up to the hearing of the gods .
but , if there be , or ever were , one such , it past the size of dreaming nature wants stuff to vie strange forms with fancy , yet , to imagine and antony , were nature piece fancy , condemning shadows quite .
hear me , good madam .
your loss is as yourself , great , and you bear it as answering to the weight would i might never pursued success , but i do feel , by the rebound of yours , a grief that smites my very heart at root .
i thank you , sir , know you what caesar means to do with me ?
i am loath to tell you what i would you knew .
nay , pray you , sir , though he be honourable , he lead me , then , in triumph ?
madam , he will , i .
flourish , and shout within , way there octavius caesar ! '
enter octavius caesar , gallus , proculeius , mecaenas , seleucus , and others of his train which is the queen of egypt ?
it is the emperor , madam .
cleopatra kneels arise , you shall not kneel i pray you , rise , rise , egypt .
sir , the gods will have it thus , my master and my lord i must obey .
take to you no hard thoughts the record of what injuries you did us , though written in our flesh , we shall remember as things but done by chance .
sole sir o ' the world , i can not project mine own cause so well to make it clear , but do confess i have been laden with like frailties which before have often shamed our sex .
cleopatra , know , we will extenuate rather than enforce if you apply yourself to our intents , which towards you are most gentle , you shall find a benefit in this change , but if you seek to lay on me a cruelty , by taking antony course , you shall bereave yourself of my good purposes , and put your children to that destruction which i guard them from , if thereon you rely .
i take my leave .
and may , through all the world is yours , and we , your scutcheons and your signs of conquest , shall hang in what place you please .
here , my good lord .
you shall advise me in all for cleopatra .
this is the brief of money , plate , and jewels , i am possess of is exactly valued , not petty things admitted .
where seleucus ?
here , madam .
this is my treasurer let him speak , my lord , upon his peril , that i have reserved to myself nothing .
speak the truth , seleucus .
madam , i had rather seal my lips , than , to my peril , speak that which is not .
what have i kept back ?
enough to purchase what you have made known .
nay , blush not , cleopatra , i approve your wisdom in the deed .
see , caesar !
o , behold , how pomp is follow !
mine will now be yours , and , should we shift estates , yours would be mine .
the ingratitude of this seleucus does even make me wild o slave , of no more trust than love that hired !
what , goest thou back ?
thou shalt go back , i warrant thee , but i catch thine eyes , though they had wings slave , soulless villain , dog !
o rarely base !
good queen , let us entreat you .
o caesar , what a wounding shame is this , that thou , vouchsafing here to visit me , doing the honour of thy lordliness to one so meek , that mine own servant should parcel the sum of my disgraces by addition of his envy !
say , good caesar , that i some lady trifles have reserved , immoment toys , things of such dignity as we greet modern friends withal , and say , some nobler token i have kept apart for livia and octavia , to induce their mediation , must i be unfolded with one that i have bred ?
the gods !
it smites me beneath the fall i have .
to seleucus prithee , go hence , or i shall show the cinders of my spirits through the ashes of my chance wert thou a man , thou wouldst have mercy on me .
forbear , seleucus .
exit seleucus be it known , that we , the greatest , are misthought for things that others do , and , when we fall , we answer others ' merits in our name , are therefore to be pitied .
cleopatra , not what you have reserved , nor what acknowledged , put we i ' the roll of conquest still yours , bestow it at your pleasure , and believe , caesar no merchant , to make prize with you of things that merchants sold .
therefore be cheer , make not your thoughts your prisons no , dear queen , for we intend so to dispose you as yourself shall give us counsel .
feed , and sleep our care and pity is so much upon you , that we remain your friend , and so , adieu .
my master , and my lord !
not so .
adieu .

the gods forbid !
nay , is most certain , iras saucy lictors will catch at us , like strumpets , and scald rhymers ballad us out o ' tune the quick comedians extemporally will stage us , and present our alexandrian revels , antony shall be brought drunken forth , and i shall see some squeaking cleopatra boy my greatness i ' the posture of a whore .

wherefore this noise ?
exit iras .
a noise within enter a guardsman here is a rural fellow that will not be denied your highness presence he brings you figs .
let him come in .
exit guardsman what poor an instrument may do a noble deed !
he brings me liberty .
my resolution placed , and i have nothing of woman in me now from head to foot i am , now the fleeting moon no planet is of mine .
guardsman , with clown bringing in a basket this is the man .
avoid , and leave him .
exit guardsman hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there , that kills and pains not ?
truly , i have him but i would not be the party that should desire you to touch him , for his biting is immortal , those that do die of it do seldom or never recover .
rememberest thou any that have died o ?
very many , men and women too .
i heard of one of them no longer than yesterday a very honest woman , but something given to lie , as a woman should not do , but in the way of honesty how she died of the biting of it , what pain she felt truly , she makes a very good report o ' the worm , but he that will believe all that they say , shall never be saved by half that they do but this is most fallible , the worm an odd worm .
get thee hence , farewell .
i wish you all joy of the worm .
setting down his basket farewell .
you must think this , look you , that the worm will do his kind .
ay , ay , farewell .
look you , the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of wise people , for , indeed , there is no goodness in worm .
take thou no care , it shall be heeded .
very good .
give it nothing , i pray you , for it is not worth the feeding .
will it eat me ?
you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself will not eat a woman i know that a woman is a dish for the gods , if the devil dress her not .
but , truly , these same whoreson devils do the gods great harm in their women , for in every ten that they make , the devils mar five .
well , get thee gone , farewell .
yes , forsooth i wish you joy o ' the worm .
exit iras with a robe , crown , and c give me my robe , put on my crown , i have immortal longings in me now no more the juice of egypt grape shall moist this lip yare , yare , good iras , quick .
methinks i hear antony call , i see him rouse himself to praise my noble act , i hear him mock the luck of caesar , which the gods give men to excuse their after wrath husband , i come now to that name my courage prove my title !
i am fire and air , my other elements i give to baser life .
so , have you done ?
come then , and take the last warmth of my lips .
farewell , kind charmian , iras , long farewell .
kisses them .
iras falls and dies have i the aspic in my lips ?
dost fall ?
if thou and nature can so gently part , the stroke of death is as a lover pinch , which hurts , and is desired .
dost thou lie still ?
if thus thou vanishest , thou the world it is not worth .
dissolve , thick cloud , and rain , that i may say , the gods themselves do weep !
this proves me base if she first meet the curled antony , he make demand of her , and spend that kiss which is my heaven to have .
come , thou mortal wretch , to an asp , which she applies to her breast with thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate of life at once untie poor venomous fool be angry , and dispatch .
o , couldst thou speak , that i might hear thee call great caesar ass unpolicied !
o eastern star !
peace , peace !
dost thou not see my baby at my breast , that sucks the nurse asleep ?
o , break !
o , break !
as sweet as balm , as soft as air , as gentle , o antony ! nay , i will take thee too .
applying another asp to her arm what should i stay dies in this vile world ?
so , fare thee well .
now boast thee , death , in thy possession lies a lass unparallel .
downy windows , close , and golden phoebus never be beheld of eyes again so royal !
your crown awry , i mend it , and then play .
enter the guard , rushing in where is the queen ?
speak softly , wake her not .
caesar hath sent too slow a messenger .
applies an asp o , come apace , dispatch !
i partly feel thee .
approach , ho !
all not well caesar beguiled .
there dolabella sent from caesar , call him .
what work is here !
charmian , is this well done ?
it is well done , and fitting for a princess descended of so many royal kings .
ah , soldier !
dies dolabella how goes it here ?
all dead .
caesar , thy thoughts touch their effects in this thyself art coming to see perform the dreaded act which thou so to hinder .
within ' a way there , a way for caesar ! '
octavius caesar and all his train marching o sir , you are too sure an augurer , that you did fear is done .
bravest at the last , she levell at our purposes , and , being royal , took her own way .
the manner of their deaths ?
i do not see them bleed .
who was last with them ?
a simple countryman , that brought her figs this was his basket .
poison , then .
o caesar , this charmian lived but now , she stood and spake i found her trimming up the diadem on her dead mistress , tremblingly she stood and on the sudden dropp .
o noble weakness !
if they had swallow poison , appear by external swelling but she looks like sleep , as she would catch another antony in her strong toil of grace .
here , on her breast , there is a vent of blood and something blown the like is on her arm .
this is an aspic trail and these have slime upon them , such as the aspic leaves upon the caves of nile .
most probable that so she died , for her physician tells me she hath pursued conclusions infinite of easy ways to die .
take up her bed , and bear her women from the monument she shall be buried by her antony no grave upon the earth shall clip in it a pair so famous .
high events as these strike those that make them , and their story is no less in pity than his glory which brought them to be lamented .
our army shall in solemn show attend this funeral , and then to rome .
come , dolabella , see high order in this great solemnity .
exeunt act i scene i .
a hall in duke solinus palace .
enter duke solinus , aegeon , gaoler , officers , and other attendants proceed , solinus , to procure my fall and by the doom of death end woes and all .
merchant of syracuse , plead no more , i am not partial to infringe our laws the enmity and discord which of late sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke to merchants , our countrymen , who wanting guilders to redeem their lives have seal his rigorous statutes with their bloods , excludes all pity from our threatening looks .
for , since the mortal and intestine jars thy seditious countrymen and us , it hath in solemn synods been decreed both by the syracusians and ourselves , to admit no traffic to our adverse towns nay , more , if any born at ephesus be seen at any syracusian marts and fairs , again if any syracusian born come to the bay of ephesus , he dies , his goods confiscate to the duke dispose , unless a thousand marks be levied , to quit the penalty and to ransom him .
thy substance , valued at the highest rate , can not amount unto a hundred marks , therefore by law thou art condemned to die .
yet this my comfort when your words are done , my woes end likewise with the evening sun .
well , syracusian , say in brief the cause why thou from thy native home and for what cause thou camest to ephesus .
a heavier task could not have been imposed than i to speak my griefs unspeakable yet , that the world may witness that my end was wrought by nature , not by vile offence , i utter what my sorrows give me leave .
in syracusa was i born , and wed unto a woman , happy but for me , and by me , had not our hap been bad .
with her i lived in joy , our wealth increased by prosperous voyages i often made to epidamnum , till my factor death and the great care of goods at random left drew me from kind embracements of my spouse from whom my absence was not six months old before herself , almost at fainting under the pleasing punishment that women bear , had made provision for her following me and soon and safe arrived where i was .
there had she not been long , but she became a joyful mother of two goodly sons , and , which was strange , the one so like the other , as could not be distinguish but by names .
that very hour , and in the inn , a meaner woman was delivered of such a burden , male twins , both alike those , for their parents were exceeding poor , i bought and brought up to attend my sons .
my wife , not meanly proud of two such boys , made daily motions for our home return unwilling i agreed .
alas !
too soon , we came aboard .
a league from epidamnum had we sail , before the always deep gave any tragic instance of our harm but longer did we not retain much hope , for what obscured light the heavens did grant did but convey unto our fearful minds a doubtful warrant of immediate death , which though myself would gladly have embraced , yet the incessant weepings of my wife , weeping before for what she saw must come , and piteous plainings of the pretty babes , that mourn for fashion , ignorant what to fear , forced me to seek delays for them and me .
and this it was , for other means was none the sailors sought for safety by our boat , and left the ship , then , to us my wife , more careful for the , had fasten him unto a small spare mast , such as seafaring men provide for storms , to him one of the other twins was bound , whilst i had been like heedful of the other the children thus disposed , my wife and i , fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix , fasten ourselves at either end the mast , and floating straight , obedient to the stream , was carried towards corinth , as we thought .
at length the sun , gazing upon the earth , dispersed those vapours that offended us , and by the benefit of his wished light , the seas wax calm , and we discovered two ships from far making amain to us , of corinth that , of epidaurus this but ere they came , o , let me say no more !
gather the sequel by that went before .
nay , forward , old man , do not break off so , for we may pity , though not pardon thee .
o , had the gods done so , i had not now worthily term them merciless to us !
for , ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues , we were encounterd by a mighty rock , which being violently borne upon , our helpful ship was splitted in the midst , so that , in this unjust divorce of us , fortune had left to both of us alike what to delight in , what to sorrow for .
her part , poor soul !
seeming as burdened with lesser weight but not with lesser woe , was carried with more speed before the wind , and in our sight they three were taken up by fishermen of corinth , as we thought .
at length , another ship had seized on us , and , knowing whom it was their hap to save , gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck guests , and would have reft the fishers of their prey , had not their bark been very slow of sail , and therefore homeward did they bend their course .
thus have you heard me sever from my bliss , that by misfortunes was my life prolong , to tell sad stories of my own mishaps .
and for the sake of them thou sorrowest for , do me the favour to dilate at full what hath of them and thee till now .
my youngest boy , and yet my eldest care , at eighteen years became inquisitive after his brother and importuned me that his attendant so his case was like , reft of his brother , but retain his name might bear him company in the quest of him whom whilst i labour of a love to see , i hazarded the loss of whom i loved .
five summers have i spent in furthest greece , roaming clean through the bounds of asia , and , coasting homeward , came to ephesus , hopeless to find , yet loath to leave unsought or that or any place that harbours men .
but here must end the story of my life , and happy were i in my timely death , could all my travels warrant me they live .
hapless aegeon , whom the fates have mark to bear the extremity of dire mishap !
now , trust me , were it not against our laws , against my crown , my oath , my dignity , which princes , would they , may not disannul , my soul would sue as advocate for thee .
but , though thou art adjudged to the death and passed sentence may not be recall but to our honour great disparagement , yet i will favour thee in what i can .
therefore , merchant , i limit thee this day to seek thy life by beneficial help try all the friends thou hast in ephesus , beg thou , or borrow , to make up the sum , and live , if no , then thou art doom to die .
gaoler , take him to thy custody .
i will , my lord .
hopeless and helpless doth aegeon wend , but to procrastinate his lifeless end .
exeunt scene ii .
the mart .
enter antipholus of syracuse , dromio of syracuse , and first merchant therefore give out you are of epidamnum , lest that your goods too soon be confiscate .
this very day a syracusian merchant is apprehended for arrival here , and not being able to buy out his life according to the statute of the town , dies ere the weary sun set in the west .
there is your money that i had to keep .
antipholus go bear it to the centaur , where we host , and stay there , dromio , till i come to thee .
within this hour it will be till that , i view the manners of the town , peruse the traders , gaze upon the buildings , and then return and sleep within mine inn , for with long travel i am stiff and weary .
get thee away .
many a man would take you at your word , and go indeed , having so good a mean .
exit antipholus a trusty villain , sir , that very oft , when i am dull with care and melancholy , lightens my humour with his merry jests .
what , will you walk with me about the town , and then go to my inn and dine with me ?
i am invited , sir , to certain merchants , of whom i hope to make much benefit , i crave your pardon .
soon at five , please you , i meet with you upon the mart and afterward consort you till my present business calls me from you now .
antipholus farewell till then i will go lose myself and wander up and down to view the city .
sir , i commend you to your own content .
exit antipholus he that commends me to mine own content commends me to the thing i can not get .
i to the world am like a drop of water that in the ocean seeks another drop , who , falling there to find his fellow forth , unseen , inquisitive , confounds himself so i , to find a mother and a brother , in quest of them , unhappy , lose myself .
enter dromio of ephesus here comes the almanac of my true date .
what now ?
how chance thou art return so soon ?
return so soon !
rather approach too late the capon burns , the pig falls from the spit , the clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell , my mistress made it one upon my cheek she is so hot because the meat is cold , the meat is cold because you come not home , you come not home because you have no stomach , you have no stomach having broke your fast , but we that know what is to fast and pray are penitent for your default .
antipholus stop in your wind , sir tell me this , i pray where have you left the money that i gave you ?
o , sixpence , that i had o ' wednesday last to pay the saddler for my mistress ' crupper ?
the saddler had it , sir , i kept it not .
antipholus i am not in a sportive humour now tell me , and dally not , where is the money ?
we being strangers here , how darest thou trust so great a charge from thine own custody ?
i pray you , air , as you sit at dinner i from my mistress come to you in post , if i return , i shall be post indeed , for she will score your fault upon my pate .
methinks your maw , like mine , should be your clock , and strike you home without a messenger .
antipholus come , dromio , come , these jests are out of season , reserve them till a merrier hour than this .
where is the gold i gave in charge to thee ?
to me , sir ?
why , you gave no gold to me .
antipholus come on , sir knave , have done your foolishness , and tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge .
my charge was but to fetch you from the mart home to your house , the phoenix , sir , to dinner my mistress and her sister stays for you .
antipholus in what safe place you have bestow my money , or i shall break that merry sconce of yours that stands on tricks when i am undisposed where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me ?
i have some marks of yours upon my pate , some of my mistress ' marks upon my shoulders , but not a thousand marks between you both .
if i should pay your worship those again , perchance you will not bear them patiently .
antipholus thy mistress ' marks ?
what mistress , slave , hast thou ?
your worship wife , my mistress at the phoenix , she that doth fast till you come home to dinner , and prays that you will hie you home to dinner .
antipholus what , wilt thou flout me thus unto my face , being forbid ?
there , take you that , sir knave .
what mean you , sir ?
for god sake , hold your hands !
nay , and you will not , sir , i take my heels .
exit antipholus upon my life , by some device or other the villain is of all my money .
they say this town is full of cozenage , as , nimble jugglers that deceive the eye , sorcerers that change the mind , witches that deform the body , disguised cheaters , prating mountebanks , and many liberties of sin if it prove so , i will be gone the sooner .
i to the centaur , to go seek this slave i greatly fear my money is not safe .
exit act ii scene i .
the house of antipholus of ephesus .
enter adriana and luciana neither my husband nor the slave return , that in such haste i sent to seek his master !
sure , luciana , it is two .
perhaps some merchant hath invited him , and from the mart he somewhere gone to dinner .
good sister , let us dine and never fret a man is master of his liberty time is their master , and , when they see time , they go or come if so , be patient , sister .
why should their liberty than ours be more ?
because their business still lies out o ' door .
look , when i serve him so , he takes it o , know he is the bridle of your will .
there none but asses will be bridled so .
why , headstrong liberty is lash with woe .
there nothing situate under heaven eye but hath his bound , in earth , in sea , in sky the beasts , the fishes , and the winged fowls , are their males ' subjects and at their controls men , more divine , the masters of all these , lords of the wide world and wild watery seas , indued with intellectual sense and souls , of more preeminence than fish and fowls , are masters to their females , and their lords then let your will attend on their accords .
this servitude makes you to keep unwed .
not this , but troubles of the .
but , were you wedded , you would bear some sway .
ere i learn love , i practise to obey .
how if your husband start some other where ?
till he come home again , i would forbear .
patience unmoved !
no marvel though she pause , they can be meek that have no other cause .
a wretched soul , bruised with adversity , we bid be quiet when we hear it cry , but were we burdened with like weight of pain , as much or more would we ourselves complain so thou , that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee , with urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me , but , if thou live to see like right bereft , this patience in thee will be left .
well , i will marry one day , but to try .
here comes your man , now is your husband nigh .
enter dromio of ephesus say , is your tardy master now at hand ?
nay , he at two hands with me , and that my two ears can witness .
say , didst thou speak with him ?
thou his mind ?
ay , ay , he told his mind upon mine ear beshrew his hand , i scarce could understand it .
spake he so doubtfully , thou couldst not feel his meaning ?
nay , he struck so plainly , i could too well feel his blows , and withal so doubtfully that i could scarce understand them .
but say , i prithee , is he coming home ?
it seems he hath great care to please his wife .
why , mistress , sure my master is .
, thou villain !
i mean not , but , sure , he is stark mad .
when i desired him to come home to dinner , he ask me for a thousand marks in gold , ' quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he , meat doth burn , ' quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he you come home ? '
quoth i , gold ! '
quoth he .
is the thousand marks i gave thee , villain ? '
pig , ' quoth i , burn , ' gold ! '
quoth he mistress , sir ' quoth i , up thy mistress !
i know not thy mistress , out on thy mistress ! '
quoth who ?
quoth my master ' i know , ' quoth he , house , no wife , no mistress . '
so that my errand , due unto my tongue , i thank him , i bare home upon my shoulders , for , in conclusion , he did beat me there .
go back again , thou slave , and fetch him home .
go back again , and be new beaten home ?
for god sake , send some other messenger .
back , slave , or i will break thy pate across .
and he will bless that cross with other beating between you i shall have a holy head .
hence , prating peasant !
fetch thy master home .
am i so round with you as you with me , that like a football you do spurn me thus ?
you spurn me hence , and he will spurn me hither if i last in this service , you must case me in leather .
exit fie , how impatience loureth in your face !
his company must do his minions grace , whilst i at home starve for a merry look .
hath homely age the alluring beauty took from my poor cheek ?
then he hath wasted it are my discourses dull ?
barren my wit ?
if voluble and sharp discourse be marr , unkindness blunts it more than marble hard do their gay vestments his affections bait ?
that not my fault he master of my state what ruins are in me that can be found , by him not ruin ?
then is he the ground of my defeatures .
my decayed fair a sunny look of his would soon repair but , too unruly deer , he breaks the pale and feeds from home , poor i am but his stale .
jealousy !
fie , beat it hence !
unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense .
i know his eye doth homage otherwhere , or else what lets it but he would be here ?
sister , you know he promised me a chain , would that alone , alone he would detain , so he would keep fair quarter with his bed !
i see the jewel best enamelled will lose his beauty , yet the gold bides still , that others touch , and often touching will wear gold and no man that hath a name , by falsehood and corruption doth it shame .
since that my beauty can not please his eye , i weep what left away , and weeping die .
how many fond fools serve mad jealousy !
exeunt scene ii .
a public place .
enter antipholus of syracuse antipholus the gold i gave to dromio is laid up safe at the centaur , and the heedful slave is wander forth , in care to seek me out by computation and mine host report .
i could not speak with dromio since at first i sent him from the mart .
see , here he comes .
enter dromio of syracuse how now sir !
is your merry humour alter ?
as you love strokes , so jest with me again .
you know no centaur ?
you received no gold ?
your mistress sent to have me home to dinner ?
my house was at the phoenix ?
wast thou mad , that thus so madly thou didst answer me ?
what answer , sir ?
when spake i such a word ?
antipholus even now , even here , not half an hour since .
i did not see you since you sent me hence , home to the centaur , with the gold you gave me .
antipholus villain , thou didst deny the gold receipt , and me of a mistress and a dinner , for which , i hope , thou i was displeased .
i am glad to see you in this merry vein what means this jest ?
i pray you , master , tell me .
antipholus yea , dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth ?
thou i jest ?
hold , take thou that , and that .
beating him hold , sir , for god sake !
now your jest is earnest upon what bargain do you give it me ?
antipholus because that i familiarly sometimes do use you for my fool and chat with you , your sauciness will jest upon my love and make a common of my serious hours .
when the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport , but creep in crannies when he hides his beams .
if you will jest with me , know my aspect , and fashion your demeanor to my looks , or i will beat this method in your sconce .
sconce call you it ?
so you would leave battering , i had rather have it a head an you use these blows long , i must get a sconce for my head and ensconce it too , or else i shall seek my wit in my shoulders .
but , i pray , sir why am i beaten ?
antipholus dost thou not know ?
nothing , sir , but that i am beaten .
antipholus shall i tell you why ?
ay , sir , and wherefore , for they say every why hath a wherefore .
antipholus why , first , for flouting me , and then , wherefore for urging it the second time to me .
was there ever any man thus beaten out of season , when in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme nor reason ?
well , sir , i thank you .
antipholus thank me , sir , for what ?
marry , sir , for this something that you gave me for nothing .
antipholus i make you amends next , to give you nothing for something .
but say , sir , is it ?
no , sir , i think the meat wants that i have .
antipholus in good time , sir , what that ?
basting .
antipholus well , sir , then be dry .
if it be , sir , i pray you , eat none of it .
antipholus your reason ?
lest it make you choleric and purchase me another dry basting .
antipholus well , sir , learn to jest in good time there a time for all things .
i durst have denied that , before you were so choleric .
antipholus by what rule , sir ?
marry , sir , by a rule as plain as the plain bald pate of father time himself .
antipholus let hear it .
there no time for a man to recover his hair that grows bald by nature .
antipholus may he not do it by fine and recovery ?
yes , to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the lost hair of another man .
antipholus why is time such a niggard of hair , being , as it is , so plentiful an excrement ?
because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts , and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit .
antipholus why , but there many a man hath more hair than wit .
not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair .
antipholus why , thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit .
the plainer dealer , the sooner lost yet he loseth it in a kind of jollity .
antipholus for what reason ?
for two , and sound ones too .
antipholus nay , not sound , i pray you .
sure ones , then .
antipholus nay , not sure , in a thing falsing .
certain ones then .
antipholus name them .
the one , to save the money that he spends in trimming , the other , that at dinner they should not drop in his porridge .
antipholus you would all this time have proved there is no time for all things .
marry , and did , sir , namely , no time to recover hair lost by nature .
antipholus but your reason was not substantial , why there is no time to recover .
thus i mend it time himself is bald and therefore to the world end will have bald followers .
antipholus i knew be a bald conclusion but , soft !
who wafts us yonder ?
enter adriana and luciana ay , ay , antipholus , look strange and frown some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects , i am not adriana nor thy wife .
the time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow that never words were music to thine ear , that never object pleasing in thine eye , that never touch well welcome to thy hand , that never meat in thy taste , unless i spake , or look , or touch , or carved to thee .
how comes it now , my husband , o , how comes it , that thou art thus estranged from thyself ?
thyself i call it , being strange to me , that , undividable , incorporate , am better than thy dear self better part .
ah , do not tear away thyself from me !
for know , my love , as easy mayest thou fall a drop of water in the breaking gulf , and take unmingled that same drop again , without addition or diminishing , as take from me thyself and not me too .
how dearly would it touch me to the quick , shouldst thou but hear i were licentious and that this body , consecrate to thee , by ruffian lust should be contaminate !
wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me and hurl the name of husband in my face and tear the stain skin off my and from my false hand cut the and break it with a vow ?
i know thou canst , and therefore see thou do it .
i am possess with an adulterate blot , my blood is mingled with the crime of lust for if we too be one and thou play false , i do digest the poison of thy flesh , being strumpeted by thy contagion .
keep then far league and truce with thy true bed , i live unstain , thou undishonoured .
antipholus plead you to me , fair dame ?
i know you not in ephesus i am but two hours old , as strange unto your town as to your talk , who , every word by all my wit being scann , want wit in all one word to understand .
fie , brother !
how the world is changed with you !
when were you wont to use my sister thus ?
she sent for you by dromio home to dinner .
antipholus by dromio ?
by me ?
by thee , and this thou didst return from him , that he did buffet thee , and , in his blows , denied my house for his , me for his wife .
antipholus did you converse , sir , with this gentlewoman ?
what is the course and drift of your compact ?
i , sir ?
i never saw her till this time .
antipholus villain , thou liest , for even her very words didst thou deliver to me on the mart .
i never spake with her in all my life .
antipholus how can she thus then call us by our names , unless it be by inspiration .
how ill agrees it with your gravity to counterfeit thus grossly with your slave , abetting him to thwart me in my mood !
be it my wrong you are from me exempt , but wrong not that wrong with a more contempt .
come , i will fasten on this sleeve of thine thou art an elm , my husband , i a vine , whose weakness , married to thy stronger state , makes me with thy strength to communicate if aught possess thee from me , it is dross , usurping ivy , brier , or idle moss , who , all for want of pruning , with intrusion infect thy sap and live on thy confusion .
antipholus to me she speaks , she moves me for her theme what , was i married to her in my dream ?
or sleep i now and think i hear all this ?
what error drives our eyes and ears amiss ?
until i know this sure uncertainty , i entertain the offer fallacy .
dromio , go bid the servants spread for dinner .
o , for my beads !
i cross me for a sinner .
this is the fairy land o spite of spites !
we talk with goblins , owls and sprites if we obey them not , this will ensue , they suck our breath , or pinch us black and blue .
why pratest thou to thyself and not ?
dromio , thou drone , thou snail , thou slug , thou sot !
i am transformed , master , am i not ?
antipholus i think thou art in mind , and so am i .
nay , master , both in mind and in my shape .
antipholus thou hast thine own form .
no , i am an ape .
if thou art changed to aught , is to an ass .
is true , she rides me and i long for grass .
is so , i am an ass , else it could never be but i should know her as well as she knows me .
come , come , no longer will i be a fool , to put the finger in the eye and weep , whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn .
come , sir , to dinner .
dromio , keep the gate .
husband , i dine above with you and shrive you of a thousand idle pranks .
sirrah , if any ask you for your master , say he dines forth , and let no creature enter .
come , sister .
dromio , play the porter well .
antipholus am i in earth , in heaven , or in hell ?
sleeping or waking ?
mad or ?
known unto these , and to myself disguised !
i say as they say and persever so , and in this mist at all adventures go .
master , shall i be porter at the gate ?
ay , and let none enter , lest i break your pate .
come , come , antipholus , we dine too late .

but here a villain that would face me down he met me on the mart , and that i beat him , and charged him with a thousand marks in gold , and that i did deny my wife and house .
thou drunkard , thou , what didst thou mean by this ?
say what you will , sir , but i know what i know , that you beat me at the mart , i have your hand to show if the skin were parchment , and the blows you gave were ink , your own handwriting would tell you what i think .
antipholus i think thou art an ass .
marry , so it doth appear by the wrongs i suffer and the blows i bear .
i should kick , being kick , and , being at that pass , you would keep from my heels and beware of an ass .
antipholus you sad , signior balthazar pray god our cheer may answer my good will and your good welcome here .
i hold your dainties cheap , sir , and your welcome dear .
antipholus o , signior balthazar , either at flesh or fish , a table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish .
good meat , sir , is common , that every churl affords .
antipholus and welcome more common , for that nothing but words .
small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast .
antipholus ay , to a niggardly host , and more sparing guest but though my cates be mean , take them in good part , better cheer may you have , but not with better heart .
but , soft !

my master stays in the street .
within let him walk from whence he came , lest he catch cold on feet .
antipholus who talks within there ?
ho , open the door !
within right , sir , i tell you when , an you tell me wherefore .
antipholus wherefore ?
for my dinner i have not dined .
within nor here you must not , come again when you may .
antipholus what art thou that keepest me out from the house i owe ?
within the porter for this time , sir , and my name is dromio .
o villain !
thou hast stolen both mine office and my name .
the one got me credit , the other mickle blame .
if thou hadst been dromio in my place , thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy name for an ass .
within what a coil is there , dromio ?
who are those at the gate ?
let my master in , luce .
within faith , no , he comes too late , and so tell your master .
o lord , i must laugh !
have at you with a proverb shall i set in my staff ?
within have at you with another , that when ?
can you tell ?
within if thy name be call luce luce , thou hast answered him well .
do you hear , you minion ?
you let us in , i hope ?
of ephesus within i thought to have asked you .
within and you said no .
so , come , help well struck !
there was blow for blow .
antipholus thou baggage , let me in .
within can you tell for whose sake ?
master , knock the door hard .
within let him knock till it ache .
antipholus you cry for this , minion , if i beat the door down .
within what needs all that , and a pair of stocks in the town ?
within who is that at the door that keeps all this noise ?
within by my troth , your town is troubled with unruly boys .
antipholus are you there , wife ?
you might have come before .
within your wife , sir knave !
go get you from the door .
if you went in pain , master , this ' would go sore .
here is neither cheer , sir , nor welcome we would fain have either .
in debating which was best , we shall part with neither .
they stand at the door , master , bid them welcome hither .
antipholus there is something in the wind , that we can not get in .
you would say so , master , if your garments were thin .
your cake there is warm within , you stand here in the cold it would make a man mad as a buck , to be so bought and sold .
antipholus go fetch me something i break ope the gate .
within break any breaking here , and i break your knave pate .
a man may break a word with you , sir , and words are but wind , ay , and break it in your face , so he break it not behind .
within it seems thou breaking out upon thee , hind !
here too much upon thee ! '
i pray thee , let me in .
within ay , when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin .
antipholus well , i break in go borrow me a crow .
a crow without feather ?
master , mean you so ?
for a fish without a fin , there a fowl without a feather , if a crow help us in , sirrah , we pluck a crow together .
antipholus go get thee gone , fetch me an iron crow .
have patience , sir , o , let it not be so !
herein you war against your reputation and draw within the compass of suspect the unviolated honour of your wife .
once this , your long experience of her wisdom , her sober virtue , years and modesty , plead on her part some cause to you unknown and doubt not , sir , but she will well excuse why at this time the doors are made against you .
be ruled by me depart in patience , and let us to the tiger all to dinner , and about evening come yourself alone to know the reason of this strange restraint .
if by strong hand you offer to break in now in the stirring passage of the day , a vulgar comment will be made of it , and that supposed by the common rout against your yet ungalled estimation that may with foul intrusion enter in and dwell upon your grave when you are dead , for slander lives upon succession , for ever housed where it gets possession .
antipholus you have prevailed i will depart in quiet , and , in despite of mirth , mean to be merry .
i know a wench of excellent discourse , pretty and witty , wild , and yet , too , gentle there will we dine .
this woman that i mean , my wife but , i protest , without desert hath oftentimes upbraided me withal to her will we to dinner .
to angelo get you home and fetch the chain , by this i know is made bring it , i pray you , to the porpentine , for there the house that chain will i bestow be it for nothing but to spite my wife upon mine hostess there good sir , make haste .
since mine own doors refuse to entertain me , i knock elsewhere , to see if they disdain me .
i meet you at that place some hour hence .

this jest shall cost me some expense .

shall , antipholus .
even in the spring of love , thy rot ?
shall love , in building , grow so ruinous ?
if you did wed my sister for her wealth , then for her wealth sake use her with more kindness or if you like elsewhere , do it by stealth , muffle your false love with some show of blindness let not my sister read it in your eye , be not thy tongue thy own shame orator , look sweet , be fair , become disloyalty , apparel vice like virtue harbinger , bear a fair presence , though your heart be tainted , teach sin the carriage of a holy saint , be what need she be acquainted ?
what simple thief brags of his own attaint ?
is double wrong , to truant with your bed and let her read it in thy looks at board shame hath a bastard fame , well managed , ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word .
alas , poor women !
make us but believe , being compact of credit , that you love us , though others have the arm , show us the sleeve , we in your motion turn and you may move us .
then , gentle brother , get you in again , comfort my sister , cheer her , call her wife is holy sport to be a little vain , when the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife .
antipholus sweet mistress what your name is else , i know not , nor by what wonder you do hit of mine , less in your knowledge and your grace you show not than our earth wonder , more than earth divine .
teach me , dear creature , how to think and speak , lay open to my conceit , smother in errors , feeble , shallow , weak , the folded meaning of your words ' deceit .
against my soul pure truth why labour you to make it wander in an unknown field ?
are you a god ?
would you create me new ?
transform me then , and to your power i yield .
but if that i am i , then well i know your weeping sister is no wife of mine , nor to her bed no homage do i owe far more , far more to you do i decline .
o , train me not , sweet mermaid , with thy note , to drown me in thy sister flood of tears sing , siren , for thyself and i will dote spread the silver waves thy golden hairs , and as a bed i take them and there lie , and in that glorious supposition think he gains by death that hath such means to die let love , being light , be drowned if she sink !
what , are you mad , that you do reason so ?
antipholus not mad , but mated , how , i do not know .
it is a fault that springeth from your eye .
antipholus for gazing on your beams , fair sun , being by .
gaze where you should , and that will clear your sight .

antipholus no , it is thyself , mine own self better part , mine eye clear eye , my dear heart dearer heart , my food , my fortune and my sweet hope aim , my sole earth heaven and my heaven claim .

antipholus thou art dromio , thou art my man , thou art thyself .
i am an ass , i am a woman man and besides myself .
what woman man ?
and how besides thyself ?
besides thyself ?
marry , sir , besides myself , i am due to a woman , one that claims me , one that haunts me , one that will have me .
antipholus what claim lays she to thee ?
marry sir , such claim as you would lay to your horse , and she would have me as a beast not that , i being a beast , she would have me , but that she , being a very beastly creature , lays claim to me .
antipholus what is she ?
a very reverent body , ay , such a one as a man may not speak of without he say . '
i have but lean luck in the match , and yet is she a wondrous fat marriage .
antipholus how dost thou mean a fat marriage ?
marry , sir , she the kitchen wench and all grease , and i know not what use to put her to but to make a lamp of her and run from her by her own light .
i warrant , her rags and the tallow in them will burn a poland winter if she lives till doomsday , she burn a week longer than the whole world .
antipholus what complexion is she of ?
swart , like my shoe , but her face nothing half so clean kept for why , she sweats , a man may go over shoes in the grime of it .
antipholus that a fault that water will mend .
no , sir , is in grain , noah flood could not do it .
antipholus what her name ?
nell , sir , but her name and three quarters , that an ell and three quarters , will not measure her from hip to hip .
antipholus then she bears some breadth ?
no longer from head to foot than from hip to hip she is spherical , like a globe , i could find out countries in her .
antipholus in what part of her body stands ireland ?
marry , in her buttocks i found it out by the bogs .
antipholus where scotland ?
i found it by the barrenness , hard in the palm of the hand .
antipholus where france ?
in her forehead , armed and reverted , making war against her heir .
antipholus where england ?
i looked for the chalky cliffs , but i could find no whiteness in them , but i guess it stood in her chin , by the salt rheum that ran between france and it .
antipholus where spain ?
faith , i saw it not , but i felt it hot in her breath .
antipholus where america , the indies ?
oh , sir , upon her nose all embellished with rubies , carbuncles , sapphires , declining their rich aspect to the hot breath of spain , who sent whole armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose .
antipholus where stood belgia , the netherlands ?
oh , sir , i did not look so low .
to conclude , this drudge , or diviner , laid claim to me , call me dromio , swore i was assured to her , told me what privy marks i had about me , as , the mark of my shoulder , the mole in my neck , the great wart on my left arm , that i amazed ran from her as a witch and , i think , if my breast had not been made of faith and my heart of steel , she had transform me to a curtal dog and made me turn i ' the wheel .
antipholus go hie thee presently , post to the road an if the wind blow any way from shore , i will not harbour in this town if any bark put forth , come to the mart , where i will walk till thou return to me .
if every one knows us and we know none , is time , i think , to trudge , pack and be gone .
as from a bear a man would run for life , so fly i from her that would be my wife .
exit antipholus there none but witches do inhabit here , and therefore is high time that i were hence .

antipholus you gave me none you wrong me much to say so .
you wrong me more , sir , in denying it consider how it stands upon my credit .
well , officer , arrest him at my suit .
i do , and charge you in the duke name to obey me .
this touches me in reputation .
either consent to pay this sum for me or i attach you by this officer .
antipholus consent to pay thee that i never had !
arrest me , foolish fellow , if thou darest .
here is thy fee , arrest him , officer , i would not spare my brother in this case , if he should scorn me so apparently .
i do arrest you , sir you hear the suit .
antipholus i do obey thee till i give thee bail .
but , sirrah , you shall buy this sport as dear as all the metal in your shop will answer .
sir , sir , i will have law in ephesus , to your notorious shame , i doubt it not .

the ship is in her trim , the merry wind blows fair from land they stay for nought at all but for their owner , master , and yourself .
antipholus how now !
a madman !
why , thou peevish sheep , what ship of epidamnum stays for me ?
a ship you sent me to , to hire waftage .
antipholus thou drunken slave , i sent thee for a rope , and told thee to what purpose and what end .
you sent me for a rope end as soon you sent me to the bay , sir , for a bark .
antipholus i will debate this matter at more leisure and teach your ears to list me with more heed .

exit scene ii .
the house of antipholus of ephesus .
enter adriana and luciana ah , luciana , did he tempt thee so ?
mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye that he did plead in earnest ?
yea or no ?
look he or red or pale , or sad or merrily ?
what observation madest thou in this case of his heart meteors tilting in his face ?
first he denied you had in him no right .
he meant he did me none , the more my spite .
then swore he that he was a stranger here .
and true he swore , though yet forsworn he were .
then pleaded i for you .
and what said he ?
that love i begg for you he begg of me .
with what persuasion did he tempt thy love ?
with words that in an honest suit might move .
first he did praise my beauty , then my speech .
didst speak him fair ?
have patience , i beseech .
i can not , nor i will not , hold me still , my tongue , though not my heart , shall have his will .
he is deformed , crooked , old and sere , , worse bodied , shapeless everywhere , vicious , ungentle , foolish , blunt , unkind , stigmatical in making , worse in mind .
who would be jealous then of such a one ?
no evil lost is wail when it is gone .
ah , but i think him better than i say , and yet would herein others ' eyes were worse .
far from her nest the lapwing cries away my heart prays for him , though my tongue do curse .
enter dromio of syracuse here !
go , the desk , the purse !
sweet , now , make haste .
how hast thou lost thy breath ?
by running fast .
where is thy master , dromio ?
is he well ?
no , he in tartar limbo , worse than hell .
a devil in an everlasting garment hath him , one whose hard heart is button up with steel , a fiend , a fury , pitiless and rough , a wolf , nay , worse , a fellow all in buff , a , a , one that countermands the passages of alleys , creeks and narrow lands , a hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well , one that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell .
why , man , what is the matter ?
i do not know the matter he is on the case .
what , is he arrested ?
tell me at whose suit .
i know not at whose suit he is arrested well , but he in a suit of buff which him , that can i tell .
will you send him , mistress , redemption , the money in his desk ?
go fetch it , sister .
exit luciana this i wonder at , that he , unknown to me , should be in debt .
tell me , was he arrested on a band ?
not on a band , but on a stronger thing , a chain , a chain !
do you not hear it ring ?
what , the chain ?
no , no , the bell is time that i were gone it was two ere i left him , and now the clock strikes one .
the hours come back !
that did i never hear .
o , yes , if any hour meet a sergeant , a ' turns back for very fear .
as if time were in debt !
how fondly dost thou reason !
time is a very bankrupt , and owes more than he worth , to season .
nay , he a thief too have you not heard men say that time comes stealing on by night and day ?
if time be in debt and theft , and a sergeant in the way , hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day ?
luciana with a purse go , dromio , there the money , bear it straight , and bring thy master home immediately .
come , sister i am press down with conceit conceit , my comfort and my injury .
exeunt scene iii .
a public place .
enter antipholus of syracuse antipholus there not a man i meet but doth salute me as if i were their friend , and every one doth call me by my name .
some tender money to me , some invite me , some other give me thanks for kindnesses , some offer me commodities to buy even now a tailor call me in his shop and show me silks that he had bought for me , and therewithal took measure of my body .
sure , these are but imaginary wiles and lapland sorcerers inhabit here .
enter dromio of syracuse master , here the gold you sent me for .
what , have you got the picture of old adam ?
antipholus what gold is this ?
what adam dost thou mean ?
not that adam that kept the paradise but that adam that keeps the prison he that goes in the calf skin that was killed for the prodigal , he that came behind you , sir , like an evil angel , and bid you forsake your liberty .
antipholus i understand thee not .
no ?
why , is a plain case he that went , like a , in a case of leather , the man , sir , that , when gentlemen are tired , gives them a sob and them , he , sir , that takes pity on decayed men and gives them suits of durance , he that sets up his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a .
antipholus what , thou meanest an officer ?
ay , sir , the sergeant of the band , he that brings any man to answer it that breaks his band , one that thinks a man always going to bed , and says , give you good rest ! '
antipholus well , sir , there rest in your foolery .
is there any why , sir , i brought you word an hour since that the bark expedition put forth , and then were you hindered by the sergeant , to tarry for the hoy delay .
here are the angels that you sent for to deliver you .
antipholus the fellow is distract , and so am i , and here we wander in illusions some blessed power deliver us from hence !
enter a courtezan well met , well met , master antipholus .
i see , sir , you have found the goldsmith now is that the chain you promised me ?
antipholus satan , avoid !
i charge thee , tempt me not .
master , is this mistress satan ?
antipholus it is the devil .
nay , she is worse , she is the devil dam , and here she comes in the habit of a light wench and thereof comes that the wenches say damn me , ' that as much to say make me a light wench . '
it is written , they appear to men like angels of light light is an effect of fire , and fire will burn , ergo , light wenches will burn .
come not near her .
your man and you are marvellous merry , sir .
will you go with me ?
we mend our dinner here ?
master , if you do , expect , or bespeak a long spoon .
antipholus why , dromio ?
marry , he must have a long spoon that must eat with the devil .
antipholus avoid then , fiend !
what thou me of supping ?
thou art , as you are all , a sorceress i conjure thee to leave me and be gone .
give me the ring of mine you had at dinner , or , for my diamond , the chain you promised , and i be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
some devils ask but the parings of one nail , a rush , a hair , a drop of blood , a pin , a nut , a , but she , more covetous , would have a chain .
master , be wise an if you give it her , the devil will shake her chain and fright us with it .
i pray you , sir , my ring , or else the chain i hope you do not mean to cheat me so .
antipholus avaunt , thou witch !
come , dromio , let us go .
