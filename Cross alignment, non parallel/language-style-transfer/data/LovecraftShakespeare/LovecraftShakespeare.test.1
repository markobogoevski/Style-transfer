crossing the sea from england into france , this fellow here , with envious carping tongue , upbraided me about the rose i wear , saying , the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my master blushing cheeks , when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him , with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lord worthiness , i crave the benefit of law of arms .
and that is my petition , noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent , yet know , my lord , i was provoked by him , and he first took exceptions at this badge , pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewray the faintness of my master heart .
will not this malice , somerset , be left ?
your private grudge , my lord of york , will out , though so cunningly you smother it .
good lord , what madness rules in brainsick men , when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise !
good cousins both , of york and somerset , quiet yourselves , i pray , and be at peace .
let this dissension first be tried by fight , and then your highness shall command a peace .
the quarrel toucheth none but us alone , betwixt ourselves let us decide it then .
there is my pledge , accept it , somerset .
nay , let it rest where it began at first .
confirm it so , mine honourable lord .
confirm it so !
confounded be your strife !
and perish ye , with your audacious prate !
presumptuous vassals , are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us ?
and you , my lords , methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections , much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course .
it grieves his highness good my lords , be friends .
come hither , you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you , as you love our favour , quite to forget this quarrel and the cause .
and you , my lords , remember where we are , in france , amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree , how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience , and rebel !
beside , what infamy will there arise , when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy , a thing of no regard , king henry peers and chief nobility destroy themselves , and lost the realm of france !
o , think upon the conquest of my father , my tender years , and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife .
i see no reason , if i wear this rose , putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen , and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown , because , forsooth , the king of scots is crown .
but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore , as we hither came in peace , so let us still continue peace and love .
cousin of york , we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and , good my lord of somerset , unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot , and , like true subjects , sons of your progenitors , go cheerfully together and digest .
your angry choler on your enemies .
ourself , my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to calais , from thence to england , where i hope ere long to be presented , by your victories , with charles , alencon and that traitorous rout .
flourish .
exeunt all but york , warwick , exeter and vernon my lord of york , i promise you , the king prettily , methought , did play the orator .
and so he did , but yet i like it not , in that he wears the badge of somerset .
tush , that was but his fancy , blame him not , i dare presume , sweet prince , he thought no harm .
an if i wist he did , but let it rest , other affairs must now be managed .
exeunt all but exeter well didst thou , richard , to suppress thy voice , for , had the passions of thy heart burst out , i fear we should have seen decipher there more rancorous spite , more furious raging broils , than yet can be imagined or supposed .
but , no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility , this shouldering of each other in the court , this factious bandying of their favourites , but that it doth presage some ill event .
is much when sceptres are in children hands , but more when envy breeds unkind division , there comes the rain , there begins confusion .

thou ominous and fearful owl of death , our nation terror and their bloody scourge !
the period of thy tyranny approacheth .
on us thou canst not enter but by death , for , i protest , we are well fortified and strong enough to issue out and fight if thou retire , the dauphin , well appointed , stands with the snares of war to tangle thee on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch , to wall thee from the liberty of flight , and no way canst thou turn thee for redress , but death doth front thee with apparent spoil and pale destruction meets thee in the face .
ten thousand french have the sacrament to rive their dangerous artillery upon no christian soul but english talbot .
lo , there thou , a breathing valiant man , of an invincible unconquer spirit !
this is the latest glory of thy praise that i , thy enemy , due thee withal , for ere the glass , that now begins to run , finish the process of his sandy hour , these eyes , that see thee now well coloured , shall see thee wither , bloody , pale and dead .
drum afar off hark !
hark !
the dauphin drum , a warning bell , sings heavy music to thy timorous soul , and mine shall ring thy dire departure out .
exeunt general , and c he fables not , i hear the enemy out , some light horsemen , and peruse their wings .
o , negligent and heedless discipline !
how are we park and bounded in a pale , a little herd of england timorous deer , mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs !
if we be english deer , be then in blood , not , to fall down with a pinch , but rather , and desperate stags , turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel and make the cowards stand aloof at bay sell every man his life as dear as mine , and they shall find dear deer of us , my friends .

a plague upon that villain somerset , that thus delays my promised supply of horsemen , that were levied for this siege !

o god , that somerset , who in proud heart doth stop my cornets , were in talbot place !
so should we save a valiant gentleman by forfeiting a traitor and a coward .
mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep , that thus we die , while remiss traitors sleep .
o , send some succor to the distress lord !
he dies , we lose , i break my warlike word , we mourn , france smiles , we lose , they daily get , all of this vile traitor somerset .
then god take mercy on brave talbot soul , and on his son young john , who two hours since i met in travel toward his warlike father !
this seven years did not talbot see his son , and now they meet where both their lives are done .
alas , what joy shall noble talbot have to bid his young son welcome to his grave ?
away !
vexation almost stops my breath , that sunder friends greet in the hour of death .
lucy , farewell , no more my fortune can , but curse the cause i can not aid the man .
maine , blois , poictiers , and tours , are won away , all of somerset and his delay .
exit , with his soldiers thus , while the vulture of sedition feeds in the bosom of such great commanders , sleeping neglection doth betray to loss the conquest of our scarce cold conqueror , that ever living man of memory , henry the fifth whiles they each other cross , lives , honours , lands and all hurry to loss .

here is sir william lucy , who with me set from our forces forth for aid .
enter sir william lucy how now , sir william !
whither were you sent ?
whither , my lord ?
from bought and sold lord talbot , who , ring about with bold adversity , cries out for noble york and somerset , to beat assailing death from his weak legions and whiles the honourable captain there drops bloody sweat from his limbs , and , in advantage lingering , looks for rescue , you , his false hopes , the trust of england honour , keep off aloof with worthless emulation .
let not your private discord keep away the levied succors that should lend him aid , while he , renowned noble gentleman , yields up his life unto a world of odds orleans the bastard , charles , burgundy , alencon , reignier , compass him about , and talbot perisheth by your default .
york set him on , york should have sent him aid .
and york as fast upon your grace exclaims , swearing that you withhold his levied host , collected for this expedition .
york lies , he might have sent and had the horse , i owe him little duty , and less love , and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending .
the fraud of england , not the force of france , hath now entrapp the talbot never to england shall he bear his life , but dies , betray to fortune by your strife .
come , go , i will dispatch the horsemen straight within six hours they will be at his aid .
too late comes rescue he is or slain , for fly he could not , if he would have fled , and fly would talbot never , though he might .
if he be dead , brave talbot , then adieu !
his fame lives in the world , his shame in you .

i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war , that talbot name might be in thee revived when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair .
but , o malignant and stars !
now thou art come unto a feast of death , a terrible and unavoided danger therefore , dear boy , mount on my swiftest horse , and i direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight come , dally not , be gone .
is my name talbot ?
and am i your son ?
and shall i fly ?
o if you love my mother , dishonour not her honourable name , to make a bastard and a slave of me !
the world will say , he is not talbot blood , that basely fled when noble talbot stood .
fly , to revenge my death , if i be slain .
he that flies so will return again .
if we both stay , we both are sure to die .
then let me stay , and , father , do you fly your loss is great , so your regard should be , my worth unknown , no loss is known in me .
upon my death the french can little boast , in yours they will , in you all hopes are lost .
flight can not stain the honour you have won , but mine it will , that no exploit have done you fled for vantage , everyone will swear , but , if i bow , they say it was for fear .
there is no hope that ever i will stay , if the first hour i shrink and run away .
here on my knee i beg mortality , rather than life preserved with infamy .
shall all thy mother hopes lie in one tomb ?
ay , rather than i shame my mother womb .
upon my blessing , i command thee go .
to fight i will , but not to fly the foe .
part of thy father may be saved in thee .
no part of him but will be shame in me .
thou never hadst renown , nor canst not lose it .
yes , your renowned name shall flight abuse it ?
thy father charge shall clear thee from that stain .
you can not witness for me , being slain .
if death be so apparent , then both fly .
and leave my followers here to fight and die ?
my age was never tainted with such shame .
and shall my youth be guilty of such blame ?
no more can i be sever from your side , than can yourself yourself in twain divide stay , go , do what you will , the like do i , for live i will not , if my father die .
then here i take my leave of thee , fair son , born to eclipse thy life this afternoon .
come , side by side together live and die .
and soul with soul from france to heaven fly .

the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword .
where is john talbot ?
pause , and take thy breath , i gave thee life and rescued thee from death .
o , twice my father , twice am i thy son !
the life thou gavest me first was lost and done , till with thy warlike sword , despite of late , to my determined time thou gavest new date .
when from the dauphin crest thy sword struck fire , it warm thy father heart with proud desire of victory .
then leaden age , quicken with youthful spleen and warlike rage , beat down alencon , orleans , burgundy , and from the pride of gallia rescued thee .
the ireful bastard orleans , that drew blood from thee , my boy , and had the maidenhood of thy first fight , i soon encountered , and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood , and in disgrace bespoke him thus , , base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine , mean and right poor , for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot , my brave boy ' here , purposing the bastard to destroy , came in strong rescue .
speak , thy father care , art thou not weary , john ?
how dost thou fare ?
wilt thou yet leave the battle , boy , and fly , now thou art seal the son of chivalry ?
fly , to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead .
o , too much folly is it , well i wot , to hazard all our lives in one small boat !
if i die not with frenchmen rage , i shall die with mickle age by me they nothing gain an if i stay , is but the shortening of my life one day in thee thy mother dies , our household name , my death revenge , thy youth , and england fame all these and more we hazard by thy stay , all these are saved if thou wilt fly away .
the sword of orleans hath not made me smart , these words of yours draw from my heart on that advantage , bought with such a shame , to save a paltry life and slay bright fame , before young talbot from old talbot fly , the coward horse that bears me fail and die !
and like me to the peasant boys of france , to be shame scorn and subject of mischance !
surely , by all the glory you have won , an if i fly , i am not talbot son then talk no more of flight , it is no boot , if son to talbot , die at talbot foot .
then follow thou thy desperate sire of crete , thou icarus , thy life to me is sweet if thou wilt fight , fight by thy father side , and , commendable proved , let die in pride .

triumphant death , smear with captivity , young talbot valour makes me smile at thee when he perceived me shrink and on my knee , his bloody sword he brandish over me , and , like a hungry lion , did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience , but when my angry guardant stood alone , tendering my ruin and assail of none , fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clustering battle of the french , and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his spirit , and there died , my icarus , my blossom , in his pride .

once i encounter him , and thus i said maiden youth , be vanquish by a maid ' but , with a proud majestical high scorn , he answer thus talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench ' so , rushing in the bowels of the french , he left me proudly , as unworthy fight .
doubtless he would have made a noble knight , see , where he lies inhearsed in the arms of the most bloody nurser of his harms !

it were enough to fright the realm of france were but his picture left amongst you here , it would amaze the proudest of you all .
give me their bodies , that i may bear them hence and give them burial as beseems their worth .
i think this upstart is old talbot ghost , he speaks with such a proud commanding spirit .
for god sake let him have , to keep them here , they would but stink , and putrefy the air .
go , take their bodies hence .
i bear them hence , but from their ashes shall be rear a phoenix that shall make all france afeard .

an earl i am , and suffolk am i call .
be not offended , nature miracle , thou art allotted to be by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save , keeping them prisoner underneath her wings .
yet , if this servile usage once offend .
go , and be free again , as suffolk friend .
she is going o , stay !
i have no power to let her pass , my hand would free her , but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams , twinkling another counterfeited beam , so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes .
fain would i woo her , yet i dare not speak i call for pen and ink , and write my mind .
fie , de la pole !
disable not thyself , hast not a tongue ?
is she not here ?
wilt thou be daunted at a woman sight ?
ay , beauty princely majesty is such , confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough .
say , earl of suffolk if thy name be so what ransom must i pay before i pass ?
for i perceive i am thy prisoner .
how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit , before thou make a trial of her love ?
why thou not ?
what ransom must i pay ?
she beautiful , and therefore to be woo , she is a woman , therefore to be won .
wilt thou accept of ransom ?
yea , or no .
fond man , remember that thou hast a wife , then how can margaret be thy paramour ?
i were best to leave him , for he will not hear .
there all is marr , there lies a cooling card .
he talks at random , sure , the man is mad .
and yet a dispensation may be had .
and yet i would that you would answer me .
i win this lady margaret .
for whom ?
why , for my king tush , that a wooden thing !
he talks of wood it is some carpenter .
yet so my fancy may be satisfied , and peace established between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too , for though her father be the king of naples , duke of anjou and maine , yet is he poor , and our nobility will scorn the match .
hear ye , captain , are you not at leisure ?
it shall be so , disdain they so much .
henry is youthful and will quickly yield .
madam , i have a secret to reveal .
what though i be enthrall ?
he seems a knight , and will not any way dishonour me .
lady , vouchsafe to listen what i say .
perhaps i shall be rescued by the french , and then i need not crave his courtesy .
sweet madam , give me a hearing in a cause tush , women have been captivate ere now .
lady , wherefore talk you so ?
i cry you mercy , is but quid for quo .
say , gentle princess , would you not suppose your bondage happy , to be made a queen ?
to be a queen in bondage is more vile than is a slave in base servility , for princes should be free .
and so shall you , if happy england royal king be free .
why , what concerns his freedom unto me ?
i undertake to make thee henry queen , to put a golden sceptre in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head , if thou wilt condescend to be my what ?
his love .
i am unworthy to be henry wife .
no , gentle madam , i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife , and have no portion in the choice myself .
how say you , madam , are ye so content ?

yes , there is remedy enough , my lord consent , and for thy honour give consent , thy daughter shall be wedded to my king , whom i with pain have woo and won thereto , and this her imprisonment hath gained thy daughter princely liberty .
speaks suffolk as he thinks ?

trumpets sound .

that is her ransom , i deliver her , and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy .
and i again , in henry royal name , as deputy unto that gracious king , give thee her hand , for sign of plighted faith .
reignier of france , i give thee kingly thanks , because this is in traffic of a king .

i do embrace thee , as i would embrace the christian prince , king henry , were he here .
farewell , my lord good wishes , praise and prayers shall suffolk ever have of margaret .
going farewell , sweet madam but hark you , margaret , no princely commendations to my king ?
such commendations as becomes a maid , a virgin and his servant , say to him .
words sweetly placed and modestly directed .
but madam , i must trouble you again , no loving token to his majesty ?
yes , my good lord , a pure unspotted heart , never yet taint with love , i send the king .
and this withal .

base ignoble wretch !
i am descended of a gentler blood thou art no father nor no friend of mine .
out , out !
my lords , an please you , is not so , i did beget her , all the parish knows her mother liveth yet , can testify she was the first fruit of my bachelorship .
graceless !
wilt thou deny thy parentage ?
this argues what her kind of life hath been , wicked and vile , and so her death concludes .

god knows thou art a collop of my flesh , and for thy sake have i shed many a tear deny me not , i prithee , gentle joan .

you have suborn this man , of purpose to obscure my noble birth .

now cursed be the time of thy nativity !
i would the milk thy mother gave thee when thou her breast , had been a little ratsbane for thy sake !

hanging is too good .
exit take her away , for she hath lived too long , to fill the world with vicious qualities .
first , let me tell you whom you have condemn not me begotten of a shepherd swain , but issued from the progeny of kings , virtuous and holy , chosen from above , by inspiration of celestial grace , to work exceeding miracles on earth .
i never had to do with wicked spirits but you , that are polluted with your lusts , stain with the guiltless blood of innocents , corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices , because you want the grace that others have , you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils .
no , misconceived !
joan of arc hath been a virgin from her tender infancy , chaste and immaculate in very thought , whose maiden blood , thus rigorously effused , will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven .
ay , ay away with her to execution !
and hark ye , sirs , because she is a maid , spare for no faggots , let there be enow place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake , that so her torture may be shortened .
will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts ?
then , joan , discover thine infirmity , that warranteth by law to be thy privilege .
i am with child , ye bloody homicides murder not then the fruit within my womb , although ye hale me to a violent death .
now heaven forfend !
the holy maid with child !
the greatest miracle that ye wrought is all your strict preciseness come to this ?
she and the dauphin have been juggling i did imagine what would be her refuge .
well , go to , we have no bastards live , especially since charles must father it .
you are deceived , my child is none of his it was alencon that enjoy my love .
alencon !
that notorious machiavel !
it dies , an if it had a thousand lives .
o , give me leave , i have deluded you was neither charles nor yet the duke i named , but reignier , king of naples , that prevail .

that most intolerable .
why , here a girl !
i think she knows not well , there were so many , whom she may accuse .
it sign she hath been liberal and free .
and yet , forsooth , she is a virgin pure .
strumpet , thy words condemn thy brat and thee use no entreaty , for it is in vain .

enter cardinal of winchester , attended cardinal lord regent , i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king .
for know , my lords , the states of christendom , moved with remorse of these outrageous broils , have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french , and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth , to confer about some matter .
is all our travail turn to this effect ?
after the slaughter of so many peers , so many captains , gentlemen and soldiers , that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country benefit , shall we at last conclude effeminate peace ?
have we not lost most part of all the towns , by treason , falsehood and by treachery , our great progenitors had conquered ?
o warwick , warwick !
i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france .
be patient , york if we conclude a peace , it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby .
enter charles , alencon , bastard of orleans , reignier , and others since , lords of england , it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim in france , we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be .
speak , winchester , for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison voice , by sight of these our baleful enemies .
cardinal charles , and the rest , it is enacted thus that , in regard king henry gives consent , of mere compassion and of lenity , to ease your country of distressful war , and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace , you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles , upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute , submit thyself , thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him , and still enjoy thy regal dignity .
must he be then as shadow of himself ?
adorn his temples with a coronet , and yet , in substance and authority , retain but privilege of a private man ?
this proffer is absurd and reasonless .
is known already that i am possess with more than half the gallian territories , and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i , for lucre of the rest unvanquish , detract so much from that prerogative , as to be call but viceroy of the whole ?
no , lord ambassador , i rather keep that which i have than , coveting for more , be cast from possibility of all .
insulting charles !
hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league , and , now the matter grows to compromise , thou aloof upon comparison ?
either accept the title thou , of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert , or we will plague thee with incessant wars .
my lord , you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected , ten to one we shall not find like opportunity .
to say the truth , it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility , and therefore take this compact of a truce , although you break it when your pleasure serves .
how thou , charles ?
shall our condition stand ?
it shall , only reserved , you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison .
then swear allegiance to his majesty , as thou art knight , never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england , thou , nor thy nobles , to the crown of england .
so , now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensign , let your drums be still , for here we entertain a solemn peace .
exeunt scene london .
the palace .
enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi , gloucester and exeter your wondrous rare description , noble earl , of beauteous margaret hath astonish me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide , so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love .
tush , my good lord , this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise , the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them , would make a volume of enticing lines , able to ravish any dull conceit and , which is more , she is not so divine , so with choice of all delights , but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command , command , i mean , of virtuous chaste intents , to love and honour henry as her lord .
and otherwise will henry presume .
therefore , my lord protector , give consent that margaret may be england royal queen .
so should i give consent to flatter sin .
you know , my lord , your highness is betroth unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract , and not deface your honour with reproach ?
as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths , or one that , at a triumph having vow to try his strength , forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary odds a poor earl daughter is unequal odds , and therefore may be broke without offence .
why , what , i pray , is margaret more than that ?
her father is no better than an earl , although in glorious titles he excel .
yes , lord , her father is a king , the king of naples and jerusalem , and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance .
and so the earl of armagnac may do , because he is near kinsman unto charles .
beside , his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower , where reignier sooner will receive than give .
a dower , my lords !
disgrace not so your king , that he should be so abject , base and poor , to choose for wealth and not for perfect love .
henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives , as for oxen , sheep , or horse .
marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship , not whom we will , but whom his grace affects , must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore , lords , since he affects her most , it most of all these reasons bindeth us , in our opinions she should be preferr .
for what is wedlock forced but a hell , an age of discord and continual strife ?
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss , and is a pattern of celestial peace .
whom should we match with henry , being a king , but margaret , that is daughter to a king ?
her peerless feature , joined with her birth , approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit , more than in women commonly is seen , will answer our hope in issue of a king , for henry , son unto a conqueror , is likely to beget more conquerors , if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link in love .
then yield , my lords , and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen , and none but she .
whether it be through force of your report , my noble lord of suffolk , or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love , i can not tell , but this i am assured , i feel such sharp dissension in my breast , such fierce alarums both of hope and fear , as i am sick with working of my thoughts .
take , therefore , shipping , post , my lord , to france , agree to any covenants , and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown king henry faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge , among the people gather up a tenth .
be gone , i say , for , till you do return , i rest perplexed with a thousand cares .
and you , good uncle , banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were , not what you are , i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will .
and so , conduct me where , from company , i may revolve and ruminate my grief .
exit ay , grief , i fear me , both at first and last .
exeunt gloucester and exeter thus suffolk hath prevail , and thus he goes , as did the youthful paris once to greece , with hope to find the like event in love , but prosper better than the trojan did .
margaret shall now be queen , and rule the king , but i will rule both her , the king and realm .

suffolk , arise .
welcome , queen margaret i can express no kinder sign of love than this kind kiss .
o lord , that lends me life , lend me a heart replete with thankfulness !
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face a world of earthly blessings to my soul , if sympathy of love unite our thoughts .
great king of england and my gracious lord , the mutual conference that my mind hath had , by day , by night , waking and in my dreams , in courtly company or at my beads , with you , mine sovereign , makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms , such as my wit affords and of heart doth minister .
her sight did ravish , but her grace in speech , her words with wisdom majesty , makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys , such is the fulness of my heart content .
lords , with one cheerful voice welcome my love .
kneeling long live queen margaret , england happiness !
we thank you all .
flourish my lord protector , so it please your grace , here are the articles of contracted peace between our sovereign and the french king charles , for eighteen months concluded by consent .
reads , it is agreed between the french king charles , and william de la pole , marquess of suffolk , ambassador for henry king of england , that the said henry shall espouse the lady margaret , daughter unto reignier king of naples , sicilia and jerusalem , and crown her queen of england ere the thirtieth of may next ensuing .
item , that the duchy of anjou and the county of maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father ' lets the paper fall uncle , how now !
pardon me , gracious lord , some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart and dimm mine eyes , that i can read no further .
uncle of winchester , i pray , read on .
reads , it is further agreed between them , that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father , and she sent over of the king of england own proper cost and charges , without having any dowry . '
they please us well .
lord marquess , kneel down we here create thee the first duke of suffolk , and gird thee with the sword .
cousin of york , we here discharge your grace from being regent i ' the parts of france , till term of eighteen months be full expired .
thanks , uncle winchester , gloucester , york , buckingham , somerset , salisbury , and warwick , we thank you all for the great favour done , in entertainment to my princely queen .
come , let us in , and with all speed provide to see her coronation be perform .
exeunt king henry vi , queen margaret , and suffolk brave peers of england , pillars of the state , to you duke humphrey must unload his grief , your grief , the common grief of all the land .
what !
did my brother henry spend his youth , his valour , coin and people , in the wars ?
did he so often lodge in open field , in winter cold and summer parching heat , to conquer france , his true inheritance ?
and did my brother bedford toil his wits , to keep by policy what henry got ?
have you yourselves , somerset , buckingham , brave york , salisbury , and victorious warwick , received deep scars in france and normandy ?
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself , with all the learned council of the realm , studied so long , sat in the early and late , debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe , and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes ?
and shall these labours and these honours die ?
shall henry conquest , bedford vigilance , your deeds of war and all our counsel die ?
o peers of england , shameful is this league !
fatal this marriage , cancelling your fame , blotting your names from books of memory , razing the characters of your renown , defacing monuments of conquer france , undoing all , as all had never been !
nephew , what means this passionate discourse , this peroration with such circumstance ?
for france , is ours , and we will keep it still .
ay , uncle , we will keep it , if we can , but now it is impossible we should suffolk , the duke that rules the roast , hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier , whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse .
now , by the death of him that died for all , these counties were the keys of normandy .
but wherefore weeps warwick , my valiant son ?
for grief that they are past recovery for , were there hope to conquer them again , my sword should shed hot blood , mine eyes no tears .
anjou and maine !
myself did win them both , those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities , that i got with wounds , delivered up again with peaceful words ?
mort dieu !
for suffolk duke , may he be suffocate , that dims the honour of this warlike isle !
france should have torn and rent my very heart , before i would have yielded to this league .
i never read but england kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own , to match with her that brings no vantages .
a proper jest , and never heard before , that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her !
she should have stayed in france and starved in france , before my lord of gloucester , now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king .
my lord of winchester , i know your mind , is not my speeches that you do mislike , but is my presence that doth trouble ye .
rancour will out proud prelate , in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay , we shall begin our ancient bickerings .
lordings , farewell , and say , when i am gone , i prophesied france will be lost ere long .
exit so , there goes our protector in a rage .
is known to you he is mine enemy , nay , more , an enemy unto you all , and no great friend , i fear me , to the king .
consider , lords , he is the next of blood , and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage , and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west , there reason he should be displeased at it .
look to it , lords !
let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts , be wise and circumspect .
what though the common people favour him , calling him , the good duke of gloucester , ' clapping their hands , and crying with loud voice , maintain your royal excellence ! '
with preserve the good duke humphrey ! '
i fear me , lords , for all this flattering gloss , he will be found a dangerous protector .
why should he , then , protect our sovereign , he being of age to govern of himself ?
cousin of somerset , join you with me , and all together , with the duke of suffolk , we quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat .
this weighty business will not brook delay i to the duke of suffolk presently .
exit cousin of buckingham , though humphrey pride and greatness of his place be grief to us , yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displaced , he be protector .
or thou or i , somerset , will be protector , despite duke humphrey or the cardinal .
exeunt buckingham and somerset pride went before , ambition follows him .
while these do labour for their own preferment , behoves it us to labour for the realm .
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman .
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal , more like a soldier than a man o ' the church , as stout and proud as he were lord of all , swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal .
warwick , my son , the comfort of my age , thy deeds , thy plainness and thy housekeeping , hath won the greatest favour of the commons , excepting none but good duke humphrey and , brother york , thy acts in ireland , in bringing them to civil discipline , thy late exploits done in the heart of france , when thou wert regent for our sovereign , have made thee fear and honour of the people join we together , for the public good , in what we can , to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal , with somerset and buckingham ambition , and , as we may , cherish duke humphrey deeds , while they do tend the profit of the land .
so god help warwick , as he loves the land , and common profit of his country !
aside and so says york , for he hath greatest cause .
then let make haste away , and look unto the main .
unto the main !
o father , maine is lost , that maine which by main force warwick did win , and would have kept so long as breath did last !
main chance , father , you meant , but i meant maine , which i will win from france , or else be slain , exeunt warwick and salisbury anjou and maine are given to the french , paris is lost , the state of normandy stands on a tickle point , now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles , the peers agreed , and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke fair daughter .
i can not blame them all what to them ?
is thine they give away , and not their own .
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans , still revelling like lords till all be gone , while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof , while all is shared and all is borne away , ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue , while his own lands are bargain for and sold .
methinks the realms of england , france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burn unto the prince heart of calydon .
anjou and maine both given unto the french !
cold news for me , for i had hope of france , even as i have of fertile england soil .
a day will come when york shall claim his own , and therefore i will take the nevils ' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey , and , when i spy advantage , claim the crown , for that the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right , nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist , nor wear the diadem upon his head , whose humours fits not for a crown .
then , york , be still awhile , till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep , to pry into the secrets of the state , till henry , surfeiting in joys of love , with his new bride and england queen , and humphrey with the peers be at jars then will i raise aloft the rose , with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed , and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster , and , force perforce , i make him yield the crown , whose bookish rule hath pull fair england down .

enter gloucester and his duchess why droops my lord , like corn , hanging the head at ceres ' plenteous load ?
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows , as frowning at the favours of the world ?
why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth , gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight ?
what seest thou there ?
king henry diadem , enchased with all the honours of the world ?
if so , gaze on , and grovel on thy face , until thy head be circled with the same .
put forth thy hand , reach at the glorious gold .
what , too short ?
i lengthen it with mine and , having both together heaved it up , we both together lift our heads to heaven , and never more abase our sight so low as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground .
o nell , sweet nell , if thou dost love thy lord , banish the canker of ambitious thoughts .
and may that thought , when i imagine ill against my king and nephew , virtuous henry , be my last breathing in this mortal world !
my troublous dream this night doth make me sad .
what dream my lord ?
tell me , and i requite it with sweet rehearsal of my morning dream .
methought this staff , mine in court , was broke in twain , by whom i have forgot , but , as i think , it was by the cardinal , and on the pieces of the broken wand were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset , and william de la pole , first duke of suffolk .
this was my dream what it doth bode , god knows .
tut , this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucester grove shall lose his head for his presumption .
but list to me , my humphrey , my sweet duke methought i sat in seat of majesty in the cathedral church of westminster , and in that chair where kings and queens are crown , where henry and dame margaret kneel to me and on my head did set the diadem .
nay , eleanor , then must i chide outright presumptuous dame , eleanor , art thou not second woman in the realm , and the protector wife , beloved of him ?
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command , above the reach or compass of thy thought ?
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery , to tumble down thy husband and thyself from top of honour to disgrace feet ?
away from me , and let me hear no more !
what , what , my lord !
are you so choleric with eleanor , for telling but her dream ?
next time i keep my dreams unto myself , and not be cheque .
nay , be not angry , i am pleased again .
enter messenger my lord protector , is his highness ' pleasure you do prepare to ride unto saint alban , where as the king and queen do mean to hawk .
i go .
come , nell , thou wilt ride with us ?
yes , my good lord , i follow presently .
exeunt gloucester and messenger follow i must , i can not go before , while gloucester bears this base and humble mind .
were i a man , a duke , and next of blood , i would remove these tedious and smooth my way upon their headless necks , and , being a woman , i will not be slack to play my part in fortune pageant .
where are you there ?
sir john !
nay , fear not , man , we are alone , here none but thee and i .
