when i drew nigh the nameless city i knew it was accursed .
i was traveling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon , and afar i saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an grave .
fear spoke from the stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge , this of the eldest pyramid ; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see , and no man else had dared to see
remote in the desert of araby lies the nameless city , crumbling and inarticulate , its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages .
it must have been thus before the first stones of memphis were laid , and while the bricks of babylon were yet unbaked .
there is no legend so old as to give it a name , or to recall that it was ever alive ; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why .
it was of this place that abdul alhazred the mad poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained couplet that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons death may die .
i should have known that the arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city , the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man , yet i defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel .
i alone have seen it , and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine ; why no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows .
when i came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at me , chilly from the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert heat .
and as i returned its look i forgot my triumph at finding it , and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn .
for hours i waited , till the east grew grey and the stars faded , and the grey turned to roseate light edged with gold .
i heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky was clear and the vast reaches of desert still .
then suddenly above the desert far rim came the blazing edge of the sun , seen through the tiny sandstorm which was passing away , and in my fevered state i fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal to hail the fiery disc as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile .
my ears rang and my imagination seethed as i led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal place ; that place which i alone of living men had seen .
in and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places i wandered , finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men , if men they were , who built this city and dwelt therein so long ago .
the antiquity of the spot was unwholesome , and i longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind .
there were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which i did not like .
i had with me many tools , and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices ; but progress was slow , and nothing significant was revealed .
when night and the moon returned i felt a chill wind which brought new fear , so that i did not dare to remain in the city .
and as i went outside the antique walls to sleep , a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me , blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert still .
i awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams , my ears ringing as from some metallic peal .
i saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city , and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape .
once more i ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet , and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race .
at noon i rested , and in the afternoon i spent much time tracing the walls and bygone streets , and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings .
i saw that the city had been mighty indeed , and wondered at the sources of its greatness .
to myself i pictured all the spendours of an age so distant that chaldaea could not recall it , and thought of sarnath the doomed , that stood in the land of mnar when mankind was young , and of ib , that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed .
all at once i came upon a place where the bed rock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff ; and here i saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people .
hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small , squat rock houses or temples ; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation , though sandstorms had long effaced any carvings which may have been outside .
very low and were all the dark apertures near me , but i cleared on with my spade and crawled through it , carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold .
when i was inside i saw that the cavern was indeed a temple , and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert .
primitive altars , pillars , and niches , all curiously low , were not absent ; and though i saw no sculptures or frescoes , there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means .
the lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange , for i could hardly kneel upright ; but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a time .
i shuddered oddly in some of the far corners ; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible , revolting and inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple .
when i had seen all that the place contained , i crawled out again , avid to find what the temples might yield .
night had now approached , yet the tangible things i had seen made curiosity stronger than fear , so that i did not flee from the long mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first i saw the nameless city .
in the twilight i cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it , finding more vague stones and symbols , though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained the room was just as low , but much less broad , ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines .
about these shrines i was prying when the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast .
the moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins , lighting a dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me .
i knew it was this chilly , sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when i chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff .
this astonished me and made me fearful again , but i immediately recalled the sudden local winds that i had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset , and judged it was a normal thing .
i decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave , and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source ; soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me , almost out of sight .
against the choking i plodded toward this temple , which as i neared it loomed larger than the rest , and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand .
i would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch .
it poured madly out of the dark door , sighing uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins .
soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still , till finally all was at rest again ; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city , and when i glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters .
i was more afraid than i could explain , but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder ; so as soon as the wind was quite gone i crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come .
this temple , as i had fancied from the outside , was larger than either of those i had visited before ; and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds from some region beyond .
here i could stand quite upright , but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples .
on the walls and roof i beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race , curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away ; and on two of the altars i saw with rising excitement a maze of curvilinear carvings .
as i held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was too regular to be natural , and i wondered what the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon .
their engineering skill must have been vast .
then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which i had been seeking , the opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown ; and i grew faint when i saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door chiselled in the solid rock .
i thrust my torch within , beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small , numerous and steeply descending steps .
i shall always see those steps in my dreams , for i came to learn what they meant .
at the time i hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere footholds in a precipitous descent .
my mind was whirling with mad thoughts , and the words and warning of arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that men dare not know .
yet i hesitated only for a moment before advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage , feet first , as though on a ladder .
it is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have such a descent as mine .
the narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well , and the torch i held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which i was crawling .
i lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch , though i was frightened when i thought of the distance i must have be traversing .
there were changes of direction and of steepness ; and once i came to a long , low , level passage where i had to wriggle my feet first along the rocky floor , holding torch at arm length beyond my head .
the place was not high enough for kneeling .
after that were more of the steep steps , and i was still scrambling down interminably when my failing torch died out .
i do not think i noticed it at the time , for when i did notice it i was still holding it above me as if it were ablaze .
i was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of far , ancient , and forbidden places .
in the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished treasury of daemonic lore ; sentences from alhazred the mad arab , paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of damascius , and infamous lines from the delirious image du monde of gauthier de metz .
i repeated queer extracts , and muttered of afrasiab and the daemons that floated with him down the oxus ; later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of lord dunsany tales the unreveberate blackness of the abyss .
once when the descent grew amazingly steep i recited something in from thomas moore until i feared to recite more a reservoir of darkness , black as witches ' cauldrons are , when with in th ' eclipse leaning to look if foot might pass down thro ' that chasm , i saw , beneath , as far as vision could explore , the jetty sides as smooth as glass , looking as if just varnish with that dark pitch the seat of death throws out upon its slimy shore .
time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor , and i found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head .
i could not quite stand , but could kneel upright , and in the dark i shuffled and crept hither and thither at random .
i soon knew that i was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts .
as in that palaeozoic and abysmal place i felt of such things as polished wood and glass i shuddered at the possible implications .
the cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals , and were oblong and horizontal , hideously like coffins in shape and size .
when i tried to move two or three for further examination , i found that they were firmly fastened .
i saw that the passage was a long one , so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness ; crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched on .
man is so used to thinking visually that i almost forgot the darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its monotony as though i saw it .
and then in a moment of indescribable emotion i did see it .
just when my fancy merged into real sight i can not tell ; but there came a gradual glow ahead , and all at once i knew that i saw the dim outlines of a corridor and the cases , revealed by some unknown subterranean phosphorescence .
for a little while all was exactly as i had imagined it , since the glow was very faint ; but as i mechanically kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light i realised that my fancy had been but feeble .
this hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above , but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art .
rich , vivid , and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural paintings whose lines and colours were beyond description .
the cases were of a strange golden wood , with fronts of exquisite glass , and containing the mummified forms of creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man .
to convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible .
they were of the reptile kind , with body lines suggestion sometimes the crocodile , sometimes the seal , but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard .
in size they approximated a small man , and their bore delicate and evident feet curiously like human hands and fingers .
but strangest of all were their heads , which presented a contour violating all known biological principles .
to nothing can such things be well compared in one flash i thought of comparisons as varied as the cat , the bullfrog , the mythic satyr , and the human being .
not jove himself had had so colossal and protuberant a forehead , yet the horns and the noselessness and the jaw placed things outside all established categories .
i debated for a time on the reality of the mummies , half suspecting they were artificial idols ; but soon decided they were indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive .
to crown their grotesqueness , most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics , and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold , jewels , and unknown shining metals .
the importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast , for they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling .
with matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of their own , wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their dimensions ; and i could not help but think that their pictured history was allegorical , perhaps showing the progress of the race that worshipped them .
these creatures , i said to myself , were to men of the nameless city what the was to rome , or some is to a tribe of indians .
holding this view , i could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city ; the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the world before africa rose out of the waves , and of its struggles as the sea shrank away , and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held it .
i saw its wars and triumphs , its troubles and defeats , and afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its people here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles were driven to chisel their way down through the rocks in some marvellous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them .
it was all vividly weird and realistic , and its connection with the awesome descent i had made was unmistakable .
i even recognized the passages .
as i crept along the corridor toward the brighter light i saw later stages of the painted epic the of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years ; the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so long where they had settled as nomads in the earth youth , hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they had never ceased to worship .
now that the light was better i studied the pictures more closely and , remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the unknown men , pondered upon the customs of the nameless city .
many things were peculiar and inexplicable .
the civilization , which included a written alphabet , had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilizations of egypt and chaldaea , yet there were curious omissions .
i could , for example , find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs , save such as were related to wars , violence , and plagues ; and i wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural death .
it was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion .
still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and extravagance contrasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin , and of the strange new realm of paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone .
in these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by moonlight , golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls , and the splendid perfection of former times , shown spectrally and elusively by the artist .
the paradisal scenes were almost too extravagant to be believed , portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys .
at the very last i thought i saw signs of an artistic anticlimax .
the paintings were less skillful , and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes .
they seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock , coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert .
the forms of the people always represented by the sacred reptiles appeared to be gradually wasting away , through their spirit as shewn hovering above the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion .
emaciated priests , displayed as reptiles in ornate robes , cursed the upper air and all who breathed it ; and one terrible final scene shewed a man , perhaps a pioneer of ancient irem , the city of pillars , torn to pieces by members of the elder race .
i remember how the arabs fear the nameless city , and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling were bare .
as i viewed the pageant of mural history i had approached very closely to the end of the hall , and was aware of a gate through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence .
creeping up to it , i cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond ; for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance , such one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of mount everest upon a sea of sunlit mist .
behind me was a passage so cramped that i could not stand upright in it ; before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence .
reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of steps small numerous steps like those of black passages i had traversed but after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything .
swung back open against the wall of the passage was a massive door of brass , incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic , which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock .
i looked at the step , and for the nonce dared not try them .
i touched the open brass door , and could not move it .
then i sank prone to the stone floor , my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a exhaustion could banish .
as i lay still with closed eyes , free to ponder , many things i had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday the vegetations of the valley around it , and the distant lands with which its merchants traded .
the allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence , and i wondered that it would be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance .
in the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles .
i wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been , and reflected a moment on certain oddities i had noticed in the ruins .
i thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor , which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured ; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling .
perhaps the very rites here involved crawling in imitation of the creatures .
no religious theory , however , could easily explain why the level passages in that awesome descent should be as low as the temples or lower , since one could not even kneel in it .
as i thought of the crawling creatures , whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me , i felt a new throb of fear .
mental associations are curious , and i shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting , mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of the primordial life .
but as always in my strange and roving existence , wonder soon drove out fear ; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest explorer that a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps i could not doubt , and i hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give .
the frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities , and valleys in this lower realm , and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me .
my fears , indeed , concerned the past rather than the future .
not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes , miles below the world i knew and faced by another world of eery light and mist , could match the lethal dread i felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul .
an ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and temples of the nameless city , while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten , with only here and there some vaguely familiar outlines .
of what could have happened in the geological ages since the paintings ceased and the race resentfully succumbed to decay , no man might say .
life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond ; now i was alone with vivid relics , and i trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent deserted vigil .
suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since i first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon , and despite my exhaustion i found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world .
my sensations were like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night , and were as inexplicable as they were poignant .
in another moment , however , i received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound the first which had broken the utter silence of these depths .
it was a deep , low moaning , as of a distant throng of condemned spirits , and came from the direction in which i was staring .
its volume rapidly grew , till it soon reverberated rightfully through the low passage , and at the same time i became conscious of an increasing draught of old air , likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above .
the touch of this air seemed to restore my balance , for i instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise , one of which had indeed revealed the hidden tunnels to me .
i looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near , so bracing myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening .
my fear again waned low , since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown .
more and more madly poured the shrieking , moaning night wind into the gulf of the inner earth .
i dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss .
such fury i had not expected , and as i grew aware of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss i was beset by a thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination .
the malignancy of the blast awakened incredible fancies ; once more i compared myself shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful corridor , the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race , for in the fiendish clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent .
i think i screamed frantically near the last i was almost mad of the howling .
i tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent , but i could not even hold my own as i was pushed slowly and inexorably toward the unknown world .
finally reason must have wholly snapped ; for i fell babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad arab alhazred , who dreamed of the nameless city that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die .
only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place what indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark i endured or what abaddon guided me back to life , where i must always remember and shiver in the night wind till oblivion or worse claims me .
monstrous , unnatural , colossal , was the thing too far beyond all the ideas of man to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours of the morning when one can not sleep .
i have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernal cacodaemoniacal and that its voices were hideous with the viciousness of desolate eternities .
presently these voices , while still chaotic before me , seemed to my beating brain to take articulate form behind me ; and down there in the grave of unnumbered antiquities , leagues below the world of men , i heard the ghastly cursing and snarling of fiends .
turning , i saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss that could not be seen against the dusk of the corridor a nightmare horde of rushing devils ; hate distorted , grotesquely panoplied , half transparent devils of a race no man might mistake the crawling reptiles of the nameless city .
and as the wind died away i was plunged into the darkness of earth bowels ; for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile .
efficiut daemones , ut quae non sunt , sic tamen quasi sint , conspicienda hominibus exhibeant .
lacantius ( devils so work that things which are not appear to men as if they were real . )
i was far from home , and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me .
in the twilight i heard it pounding on the rocks , and i knew it lay just over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening .
and because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond , i pushed on through the shallow , snow along the road that soared lonely up to where aldebaran twinkled among the trees ; on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but often dreamed of .
it was the yuletide , that men call christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon , older than memphis and mankind .
it was the yuletide , and i had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden ; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century , that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten .
mine were an old people , and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before .
and they were strange , because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids , and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the fishers .
and now they were scattered , and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand .
i was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade , for only the poor and the lonely remember .
then beyond the hill crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming ; snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples , ridgepoles and , wharves and small bridges , and graveyards ; endless labyrinths of steep , narrow , crooked streets , and dizzy central peak that time durst not touch ; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child disordered blocks ; antiquity hovering on grey wings over gables and gambrel roofs ; fanlights and windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join orion and the archaic stars .
and against the rotting wharves the sea pounded ; the secretive , immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time .
beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose , bleak and windswept , and i saw that it was a where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse .
the printless road was very lonely , and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind .
they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in , but i did not know just where .
as the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry sounds of a village at evening , but did not hear them .
then i thought of the season , and felt that these old puritan folk might well have christmas customs strange to me , and full of silent hearthside prayer .
so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers , kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze , and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little , curtained windows .
i had seen maps of the town , and knew where to find the home of my people .
it was told that i should be known and welcomed , for village legend lives long ; so i hastened through back street to circle court , and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town , to where green lane leads off behind the market house .
the old maps still held good , and i had no trouble ; though at arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place , since i saw not a wire overhead .
snow would have hid the rails in any case .
i was glad i had chosen to walk , for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill ; and now i was eager to knock at the door of my people , the seventh house on the left in green lane , with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second storey , all built before .
there were lights inside the house when i came upon it , and i saw from the diamond that it must have been kept very close to its antique state .
the upper part overhung the narrow street and nearly met the part of the house opposite , so that i was almost in a tunnel , with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow .
there was no sidewalk , but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings .
it was an odd scene , and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before .
though it pleased me , i would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow , and people in the streets , and a few windows without drawn curtains .
when i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid .
some fear had been gathering in me , perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage , and the bleakness of the evening , and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs .
and when my knock was answered i was fully afraid , because i had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open .
but i was not afraid long , for the gowned , slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me ; and though he made signs that he was dumb , he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried .
he beckoned me into a low , room with massive exposed rafters and dark , stiff , sparse furniture of the seventeenth century .
the past was vivid there , for not an attribute was missing .
there was a cavernous fireplace and a at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep sat back toward me , silently spinning despite the festive season .
an indefinite dampness seemed upon the place , and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing .
the settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left , and seemed to be occupied , though i was not sure .
i did not like everything about what i saw , and felt again the fear i had had .
this fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it , for the more i looked at the old man bland face the more its very blandness terrified me .
the eyes never moved , and the skin was too much like wax .
finally i was sure it was not a face at all , but a fiendishly cunning mask .
but the flabby hands , curiously gloved , wrote genially on the tablet and told me i must wait a while before i could be led to the place of the festival .
pointing to a chair , table , and pile of books , the old man now left the room ; and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and mouldy , and that they included old morryster wild marvels of science , the terrible saducismus triumphatus of joseph glanvil , published in , the shocking daemonolatreja of remigius , printed in at lyons , and worst of all , the unmentionable necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , in olaus wormius ' forbidden latin translation ; a book which i had never seen , but of which i had heard monstrous things whispered .
no one spoke to me , but i could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside , and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning , spinning .
i thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting , but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings , i resolved to expect queer things .
so i tried to read , and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursed necronomicon ; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness , but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced , as if it had been stealthily opened .
it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman .
this was not much , though , for the old woman was spinning very hard , and the aged clock had been striking .
after that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle , and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume , and sat down on that very bench , so that i could not see him .
it was certainly nervous waiting , and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so .
when eleven struck , however , the old man stood up , glided to a massive carved chest in a corner , and got two hooded cloaks ; one of which he donned , and the other of which he draped round the old woman , who was ceasing her monotonous spinning .
then they both started for the outer door ; the woman lamely creeping , and the old man , after picking up the very book i had been reading , beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask .
we went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient town ; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one , and the dog star leered at the throng of cowled , cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that , past the creaking sigus and antediluvian gables , the thatched roofs and windows ; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together ; gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations .
amid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides ; jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft , and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy ; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word .
up , up , up , the eery columns slithered , and i saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town , where perched a great white church .
i had seen it from the road crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk , and it had made me shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire .
there was an open space around the church ; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts , and partly a square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind , and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables .
danced over the tombs , revealing gruesome vistas , though queerly failing to cast any shadows .
past the churchyard , where there were no houses , i could see over the hill summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour , though the town was invisible in the dark .
only once in a while a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church .
i waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway , and till all the stragglers had followed .
the old man was pulling at my sleeve , but i was determined to be the last .
crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown darkness , i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement .
and as i did so i shuddered .
for though the wind had not left much snow , a few patches did remain on the path near the door ; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet , not even mine .
the church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it , for most of the throng had already vanished .
they had streamed up the aisle between the high pews to the of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit , and were now squirming noiselessly in .
i followed dumbly down the steps and into the dark , suffocating crypt .
the tail of that sinuous line of seemed very horrible , and as i saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still .
then i noticed that the tomb floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding , and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of stone ; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous , that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar .
it was a silent , shocking descent , and i observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature , as if chiselled out of the solid rock .
what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes .
after more aeons of descent i saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery .
soon they became excessively numerous , like impious catacombs of nameless menace ; and their pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable .
i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself , and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil .
then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light , and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters .
again i shivered , for i did not like the things that the night had brought , and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite .
as the steps and the passage grew broader , i heard another sound , the thin , whining mockery of a feeble flute ; and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner world a vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean .
fainting and gasping , i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan toadstools , leprous fire and slimy water , and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar .
it was the , older than man and fated to survive him ; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring promise beyond the snows ; the rite of fire and evergreen , light and music .
and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the rite , and adore the sick pillar of flame , and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare .
i saw this , and i saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light , piping noisomely on a flute ; and as the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where i could not see .
but what frightened me most was that flaming column ; spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable , casting no shadows as healthy flame should , and coating the nitrous stone with a nasty , venomous verdigris .
for in all that seething combustion no warmth lay , but only the clamminess of death and corruption .
the man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame , and made stiff ceremonial motions to the he faced .
at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance , especially when he held above his head that abhorrent necronomicon he had taken with him ; and i shared all the obeisances because i had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers .
then the old man made a signal to the in the darkness , which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key ; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected .
at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth , transfixed with a dread not of this or any world , but only of the mad spaces between the stars .
out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame , out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny , unheard , and unsuspected , there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame , trained , hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp , or sound brain ever wholly remember .
they were not altogether crows , nor moles , nor buzzards , nor ants , nor vampire bats , nor decomposed human beings ; but something i can not and must not recall .
they flopped limply along , half with their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings ; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them , and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river , into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts .
the old spinning woman had gone with the throng , and the old man remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest .
i saw when i staggered to my feet that the amorphous had rolled out of sight , but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by .
as i hung back , the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place ; that it had been decreed i should come back , and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed .
he wrote this in a very ancient hand , and when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch , both with my family arms , to prove that he was what he said .
but it was a hideous proof , because i knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my in .
presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face , but i only shuddered , because i was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask .
the flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the lichens , and i saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself .
when one of the things began to waddle and edge away , he turned quickly to stop it ; so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head .
and then , because that nightmare position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come , i flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea ; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earth inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these might conceal .
at the hospital they told me i had been found in kingsport harbour at dawn , clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me .
they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before , and fallen over the cliffs at orange point ; a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow .
there was nothing i could say , because everything was wrong .
everything was wrong , with the broad windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient , and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below .
they insisted that this was kingsport , and i could not deny it .
when i went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on central hill , they sent me to mary hospital in arkham , where i could have better care .
i liked it there , for the doctors were , and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazred objectionable necronomicon from the library of miskatonic university .
they said something about a psychosis and agreed i had better get any harassing obsessions off my mind .
so i read that hideous chapter , and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me .
i had seen it before , let footprints tell what they might ; and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten .
there was no one in waking hours who could remind me of it ; but my dreams are filled with terror , because of phrases i dare not quote .
i dare quote only one paragraph , put into such english as i can make from the awkward low latin .
the nethermost caverns , wrote the mad arab , are not for the fathoming of eyes that see ; for their marvels are strange and terrific .
cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied , and evil the mind that is held by no head .
wisely did ibn schacabao say , that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain , and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes .
for it is of old rumour that the soul of the hastes not from his charnel clay , but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws ; till out of corruption horrid life springs , and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it .
great holes secretly are digged where earth pores ought to suffice , and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl .
west of arkham the hills rise wild , and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut .
there are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically , and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight .
on the gentle slopes there are farms , ancient and rocky , with squat , cottages brooding eternally over old new england secrets in the lee of great ledges ; but these are all vacant now , the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs .
the old folk have gone away , and foreigners do not like to live there .
have tried it , italians have tried it , and the poles have come and departed .
it is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled , but because of something that is imagined .
the place is not good for imagination , and does not bring restful dreams at night .
it must be this which keeps the foreigners away , for old ammi pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days .
ammi , whose head has been a little queer for years , is the only one who still remains , or who ever talks of the strange days ; and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around arkham .
there was once a road over the hills and through the valleys , that ran straight where the blasted heath is now ; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south .
traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness , and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir .
then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun .
and the secrets of the strange days will be one with the deep secrets ; one with the hidden lore of old ocean , and all the mystery of primal earth .
when i went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me the place was evil .
they told me this in arkham , and because that is a very old town full of witch legends i thought the evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through centuries .
the name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and theatrical , and i wondered how it had come into the folklore of a puritan people .
then i saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for myself , and ceased to wonder at anything beside its own elder mystery .
it was morning when i saw it , but shadow lurked always there .
the trees grew too thickly , and their trunks were too big for any healthy new england wood .
there was too much silence in the dim alleys between them , and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay .
in the open spaces , mostly along the line of the old road , there were little hillside farms ; sometimes with all the buildings standing , sometimes with only one or two , and sometimes with only a lone chimney or cellar .
weeds and briers reigned , and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth .
upon everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression ; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque , as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry .
i did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay , for this was no region to sleep in .
it was too much like a landscape of salvator rosa ; too much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror .
but even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath .
i knew it the moment i came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley ; for no other name could fit such a thing , or any other thing fit such a name .
it was as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one particular region .
it must , i thought as i viewed it , be the outcome of a fire ; but why had nothing new ever grown over these five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields ?
it lay largely to the north of the ancient road line , but encroached a little on the other side .
i felt an odd reluctance about approaching , and did so at last only because my business took me through and past it .
there was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse , but only a fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about .
the trees near it were sickly and stunted , and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim .
as i walked hurriedly by i saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney and cellar on my right , and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight .
even the long , dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast , and i marvelled no more at the frightened whispers of arkham people .
there had been no house or ruin near ; even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote .
and at twilight , dreading to repass that ominous spot , i walked circuitously back to the town by the curious road on the south .
i vaguely wished some clouds would gather , for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul .
in the evening i asked old people in arkham about the blasted heath , and what was meant by that phrase strange days which so many evasively muttered .
i could not , however , get any good answers except that all the mystery was much more recent than i had dreamed .
it was not a matter of old legendry at all , but something within the lifetime of those who spoke .
it had happened in the , and a family had disappeared or was killed .
speakers would not be exact ; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old ammi pierce crazy tales , i sought him out the next morning , having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick .
it was a fearsomely ancient place , and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long .
only with persistent knocking could i rouse the aged man , and when he shuffled timidly to the door i could tell he was not glad to see me .
he was not so feeble as i had expected ; but his eyes drooped in a curious way , and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal .
not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales , i feigned a matter of business ; told him of my surveying , and asked vague questions about the district .
he was far brighter and more educated than i had been led to think , and before i knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man i had talked with in arkham .
he was not like other rustics i had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be .
from him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out , though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake .
relief was all that he showed ; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life .
they were better under water now better under water since the strange days .
and with this opening his husky voice sank low , while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively .
it was then that i heard the story , and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on i shivered again and again spite the summer day .
often i had to recall the speaker from ramblings , piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors ' talk , or bridge over gaps , where his sense of logic and continuity broke down .
when he was done i did not wonder that his mind had snapped a trifle , or that the folk of arkham would not speak much of the blasted heath .
i hurried back before sunset to my hotel , unwilling to have the stars come out above me in the open ; and the next day returned to boston to give up my position .
i could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again , or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones .
the reservoir will soon be built now , and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms .
but even then i do not believe i would like to visit that country by night at least not when the sinister stars are out ; and nothing could bribe me to drink the new city water of arkham .
it all began , old ammi said , with the meteorite .
before that time there had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials , and even then these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in the miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious lone altar older than the indians .
these were not haunted woods , and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days .
then there had come that white noontide cloud , that string of explosions in the air , and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood .
and by night all arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the nahum gardner place .
that was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to come the trim white nahum gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchards .
nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone , and dropped in at ammi pierce on the way .
ammi was forty then , and all the queer things were fixed very strongly in his mind .
he and his wife had gone with the three professors from miskatonic university who hastened out the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space , and had wondered why nahum had called it so large the day before .
it had shrunk , nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic in his front yard ; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink .
its heat lingered persistently , and nahum declared it had glowed faintly in the night .
the professors tried it with a geologist hammer and found it was oddly soft .
it was , in truth , so soft as to be almost plastic ; and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing .
they took it in an old pail borrowed from nahum kitchen , for even the small piece refused to grow cool .
on the trip back they stopped at ammi to rest , and seemed thoughtful when pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the bottom of the pail .
truly , it was not large , but perhaps they had taken less than they thought .
the day after that all this was in june of the professors had trooped out again in a great excitement .
as they passed ammi they told him what queer things the specimen had done , and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker .
the beaker had gone , too , and the wise men talked of the strange stone affinity for silicon .
it had acted quite unbelievably in that laboratory ; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when heated on charcoal , being wholly negative in the borax bead , and soon proving itself absolutely at any producible temperature , including that of the blowpipe .
on an anvil it appeared highly malleable , and in the dark its luminosity was very marked .
stubbornly refusing to grow cool , it soon had the college in a state of real excitement ; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements , bizarre optical properties , and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by the unknown .
hot as it was , they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents .
water did nothing .
hydrochloric acid was the same .
nitric acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability .
ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things , but recognized some solvents as i mentioned them in the usual order of use .
there were ammonia and caustic soda , alcohol and ether , nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others ; but although the weight grew steadily less as time passed , and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling , there was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked the substance at all .
it was a metal , though , beyond a doubt .
it was magnetic , for one thing ; and after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the widmanstatten figures found on meteoric iron .
when the cooling had grown very considerable , the testing was carried on in glass ; and it was in a glass beaker that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work .
the next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace , and only a charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been .
all this the professors told ammi as they paused at his door , and once more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars , though this time his wife did not accompany him .
it had now most certainly shrunk , and even the sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw .
all around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space , except where the earth had caved in ; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before , it was now scarcely five .
it was still hot , and the sages studied its surface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel .
they gouged deeply this time , and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite homogeneous .
they had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule embedded in the substance .
the colour , which resembled some of the bands in the meteor strange spectrum , was almost impossible to describe ; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all .
its texture was glossy , and upon tapping it appeared to promise both brittleness and hollowness .
one of the professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer , and it burst with a nervous little pop .
nothing was emitted , and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing .
it left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across , and all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing substance wasted away .
conjecture was vain ; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling , the seekers left again with their new specimen which proved , however , as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor .
aside from being almost plastic , having heat , magnetism , and slight luminosity , cooling slightly in powerful acids , possessing an unknown spectrum , wasting away in air , and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result , it presented no identifying features whatsoever ; and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it .
it was nothing of this earth , but a piece of the great outside ; and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws .
that night there was a thunderstorm , and when the professors went out to nahum the next day they met with a bitter disappointment .
the stone , magnetic as it had been , must have had some peculiar electrical property ; for it had drawn the lightning , as nahum said , with a singular persistence .
six times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard , and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient , with a earth .
digging had borne no fruit , and the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment .
the failure was total ; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead .
that fragment lasted a week , at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it .
when it had gone , no residue was left behind , and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside ; that lone , weird message from other universes and other realms of matter , force , and entity .
as was natural , the arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate sponsoring , and sent reporters to talk with nahum gardner and his family .
at least one boston daily also sent a scribe , and nahum quickly became a kind of local celebrity .
he was a lean , genial person of about fifty , living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley .
he and ammi exchanged visits frequently , as did their wives ; and ammi had nothing but praise for him after all these years .
he seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had attracted , and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks .
that july and august were hot ; and nahum worked hard at his haying in the pasture across chapman brook ; his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between .
the labour tired him more than it had in other years , and he felt that age was beginning to tell on him .
then fell the time of fruit and harvest .
the pears and apples slowly ripened , and nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before .
the fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss , and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop .
but with the ripening came sore disappointment , for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat .
into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness , so that even the smallest bites induced a lasting disgust .
it was the same with the melons and tomatoes , and nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost .
quick to connect events , he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil , and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot along the road .
winter came early , and was very cold .
ammi saw nahum less often than usual , and observed that he had begun to look worried .
the rest of his family too , seemed to have grown taciturn ; and were far from steady in their or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside .
for this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found , though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet .
nahum himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain footprints in the snow .
they were the usual winter prints of red squirrels , white rabbits , and foxes , but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement .
he was never specific , but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be .
ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past nahum house in his sleigh on the way back from clark comer .
there had been a moon , and a rabbit had run across the road , and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either ammi or his horse liked .
the latter , indeed , had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein .
thereafter ammi gave nahum tales more respect , and wondered why the gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every morning .
they had , it developed , nearly lost the spirit to bark .
in february the mcgregor boys from meadow hill were out shooting woodchucks , and not far from the gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen .
the proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe , while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before .
the boys were genuinely frightened , and threw the thing away at once , so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside .
but the shying of horses near nahum house had now become an acknowledged thing , and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was fast taking form .
people vowed that the snow melted faster around nahum than it did anywhere else , and early in march there was an awed discussion in potter general store at clark corners .
stephen rice had driven past gardner in the morning , and had noticed the coming up through the mud by the woods across the road .
never were things of such size seen before , and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words .
their shapes were monstrous , and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck stephen as wholly unprecedented .
that afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth , and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world .
the bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned , and it went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in nahum ground .
of course it was the meteorite ; and remembering how strange the men from the college had found that stone to be , several farmers spoke about the matter to them .
one day they paid nahum a visit ; but having no love of wild tales and folklore were very conservative in what they inferred .
the plants were certainly odd , but all are more or less odd in shape and hue .
perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the soil , but it would soon be washed away .
and as for the footprints and frightened horses of course this was mere country talk which such a phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start .
there was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip , for superstitious rustics will say and believe anything .
and so all through the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt .
only one of them , when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a year and half later , recalled that the queer colour of that had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light shown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope , and like the brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss .
the samples in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first , though later they lost the property .
the trees budded prematurely around nahum , and at night they swayed ominously in the wind .
nahum second son thaddeus , a lad of fifteen , swore that they swayed also when there was no wind ; but even the gossips would not credit this .
certainly , however , restlessness was in the air .
the entire gardner family developed the habit of stealthy listening , though not for any sound which they could consciously name .
the listening was , indeed , rather a product of moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away .
unfortunately such moments increased week by week , till it became common speech that something was wrong with all nahum folks .
when the early saxifrage came out it had another strange colour ; not quite like that of the , but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it .
nahum took some blossoms to arkham and showed them to the editor of the gazette , but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them , in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule .
it was a mistake of nahum to tell a stolid city man about the way the great , overgrown butterflies behaved in connection with these saxifrages .
april brought a kind of madness to the country folk , and began that disuse of the road past nahum which led to its ultimate abandonment .
it was the vegetation .
all the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours , and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region .
no sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage ; but everywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased , underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth .
the dutchman breeches became a thing of sinister menace , and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion .
ammi and the gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity , and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor .
nahum ploughed and sowed the pasture and the upland lot , but did nothing with the land around the house .
he knew it would be of no use , and hoped that the summer strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil .
he was prepared for almost anything now , and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard .
the shunning of his house by neighbors told on him , of course ; but it told on his wife more .
the boys were better off , being at school each day ; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip .
thaddeus , an especially sensitive youth , suffered the most .
in may the insects came , and nahum place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling .
most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions , and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience .
the gardners took to watching at night watching in all directions at random for something they could not tell what .
it was then that they owned that thaddeus had been right about the trees .
gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky .
the boughs surely moved , and there was no wind .
it must be the sap .
strangeness had come into everything growing now .
yet it was none of nahum family at all who made the next discovery .
familiarity had dulled them , and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends .
what he told in arkham was given a short paragraph in the gazette ; and it was there that all the farmers , nahum included , saw it first .
the night had been dark and the faint , but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be nahum , the darkness had been less thick .
a dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation , grass , leaves , and blossoms alike , while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barn .
the grass had so far seemed untouched , and the cows were freely pastured in the lot near the house , but toward the end of may the milk began to be bad .
then nahum had the cows driven to the uplands , after which this trouble ceased .
not long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye .
all the verdure was going grey , and was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness .
ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place , and his visits were becoming fewer and fewer .
when school closed the gardners were virtually cut off from the world , and sometimes let ammi do their errands in town .
they were failing curiously both physically and mentally , and no one was surprised when the news of gardner madness stole around .
it happened in june , about the anniversary of the meteor fall , and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe .
in her raving there was not a single specific noun , but only verbs and pronouns .
things moved and changed and fluttered , and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds .
something was taken away she was being drained of something something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be someone must make it keep off nothing was ever still in the night the walls and windows shifted .
nahum did not send her to the county asylum , but let her wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and others .
even when her expression changed he did nothing .
but when the boys grew afraid of her , and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him , he decided to keep her locked in the attic .
by july she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours , and before that month was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the dark , as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation .
it was a little before this that the horses had stampeded .
something had aroused them in the night , and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible .
there seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them , and when nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer .
it took a week to track all four , and when found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable .
something had snapped in their brains , and each one had to be shot for its own good .
nahum borrowed a horse from ammi for his haying , but found it would not approach the barn .
it shied , balked , and whinnied , and in the end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching .
and all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle .
even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were greying now , and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless .
the asters and bloomed grey and distorted , and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such things that nahum oldest boy zenas cut them down .
the strangely puffed insects died about that time , even the bees that had left their hives and taken to the woods .
by september all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder , and nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil .
his wife now had spells of terrific screaming , and he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension .
they shunned people now , and when school opened the boys did not go .
but it was ammi , on one of his rare visits , who first realised that the well water was no longer good .
it had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid nor exactly salty , and ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again .
nahum , however , ignored the warning , for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant things .
he and the boys continued to use the tainted supply , drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and meals and did their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days .
there was something of stolid resignation about them all , as if they walked half in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom .
thaddeus went mad in september after a visit to the well .
he had gone with a pail and had come back , shrieking and waving his arms , and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about the moving colours down there .
two in one family was pretty bad , but nahum was very brave about it .
he let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and hurting himself , and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his mother .
the way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible , especially to little merwin , who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was not of earth .
merwin was getting frightfully imaginative , and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the brother who had been his greatest playmate .
almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced .
poultry turned greyish and died very quickly , their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting .
hogs grew inordinately fat , then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain .
their meat was of course useless , and nahum was at his wit end .
no rural veterinary would approach his place , and the city veterinary from arkham was openly baffled .
the swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died , and their eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations .
it was very inexplicable , for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation .
then something struck the cows .
certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed , and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common .
in the last stages and death was always the result there would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs .
there could be no question of poison , for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn .
no bites of prowling things could have brought the virus , for what live beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles ?
it must be only natural disease yet what disease could wreak such results was beyond any mind guessing .
when the harvest came there was not an animal surviving on the place , for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away .
these dogs , three in number , had all vanished one night and were never heard of again .
the five cats had left some time before , but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no mice , and only gardner had made pets of the graceful felines .
on the nineteenth of october nahum staggered into ammi house with hideous news .
the death had come to poor thaddeus in his attic room , and it had come in a way which could not be told .
nahum had dug a grave in the railed family plot behind the farm , and had put therein what he found .
there could have been nothing from outside , for the small barred window and locked door were intact ; but it was much as it had been in the barn .
ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they could , but shuddered as they did so .
stark terror seemed to cling round the gardners and all they touched , and the very presence of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable .
ammi accompanied nahum home with the greatest reluctance , and did what he might to calm the hysterical sobbing of little merwin .
zenas needed no calming .
he had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him ; and ammi thought that his fate was very merciful .
now and then merwin screams were answered faintly from the attic , and in response to an inquiring look nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble .
when night approached , ammi managed to get away ; for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind .
it was really lucky for ammi that he was not more imaginative .
even as things were , his mind was bent ever so slightly ; but had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac .
in the twilight he hastened home , the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his ears .
three days later nahum burst into ammi kitchen in the early morning , and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more , while pierce listened in a clutching fright .
it was little merwin this time .
he was gone .
he had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water , and had never come back .
he been going to pieces for days , and hardly knew what he was about .
screamed at everything .
there had been a frantic shriek from the yard then , but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone .
there was no glow from the lantern he had taken , and of the child himself no trace .
at the time nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too ; but when dawn came , and the man had plodded back from his search of the woods and fields , he had found some very curious things near the well .
there was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern ; while a bent handle and twisted iron hoops beside it , both , seemed to hint at the remnants of the pail .
that was all .
nahum was past imagining , pierce was blank , and ammi , when he had reached home and heard the tale , could give no guess .
merwin was gone , and there would be no use in telling the people around , who shunned all gardners now .
no use , either , in telling the city people at arkham who laughed at everything .
thad was gone , and now merwin was gone .
something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and heard .
nahum would go soon , and he wanted ammi to look after his wife and zenas if they survived him .
it must all be a judgment of some sort ; though he could not fancy what for , since he had always walked uprightly in the lord ways so far as he knew .
for over two weeks ammi saw nothing of nahum ; and then , worried about what might have happened , he overcame his fears and paid the gardner place a visit .
there was no smoke from the great chimney , and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst .
the aspect of the whole farm was shocking greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground , vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables , and great bare trees clawing up at the grey november sky with a studied malevolence which ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches .
but nahum was alive , after all .
he was weak , and lying on a couch in the kitchen , but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to zenas .
the room was deadly cold ; and as ammi visibly shivered , the host shouted huskily to zenas for more wood .
wood , indeed , was sorely needed ; since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty , with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney .
presently nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable , and then ammi saw what had happened .
the stoutest cord had broken at last , and the hapless farmer mind was proof against more sorrow .
questioning tactfully , ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing zenas .
in the well he lives in the well was all that the clouded father would say .
then there flashed across the visitor mind a sudden thought of the mad wife , and he changed his line of inquiry .
nabby ?
why , here she is !
was the surprised response of poor nahum , and ammi soon saw that he must search for himself .
leaving the harmless babbler on the couch , he took the keys from their nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic .
it was very close and noisome up there , and no sound could be heard from any direction .
of the four doors in sight , only one was locked , and on this he tried various keys of the ring he had taken .
the third key proved the right one , and after some fumbling ammi threw open the low white door .
it was quite dark inside , for the window was small and by the crude wooden bars ; and ammi could see nothing at all on the floor .
the stench was beyond enduring , and before proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air .
when he did enter he saw something dark in the corner , and upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright .
while he screamed he thought a momentary cloud eclipsed the window , and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some hateful current of vapour .
strange colours danced before his eyes ; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor that the geologist hammer had shattered , and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring .
as it was he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him , and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young thaddeus and the livestock .
but the terrible thing about the horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumble .
ammi would give me no added particulars of this scene , but the shape in the comer does not reappear in his tale as a moving object .
there are things which can not be mentioned , and what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law .
i gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic room , and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment .
anyone but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad , but ammi walked conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him .
there would be nahum to deal with now ; he must be fed and tended , and removed to some place where he could be cared for .
commencing his descent of the dark stairs .
ammi heard a thud below him .
he even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off , and recalled nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above .
what presence had his cry and entry started up ?
halted by some vague fear , he heard still further sounds below .
indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging , and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction .
with an associative sense goaded to feverish heights , he thought unaccountably of what he had seen upstairs .
good god !
what eldritch was this into which he had blundered ?
he dared move neither backward nor forward , but stood there trembling at the black curve of the staircase .
every trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain .
the sounds , the sense of dread expectancy , the darkness , the steepness of the narrow step and merciful heaven ! the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight ; steps , sides , exposed laths , and beams alike .
then there burst forth a frantic whinny from ammi horse outside , followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway .
in another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot , leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them .
but that was not all .
there had been another sound out there .
a sort of liquid splash water it must have been the well .
he had left hero untied near it , and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a stone .
and still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably ancient woodwork .
god !
how old the house was !
most of it built before , and the gambrel roof no later than .
a feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly , and ammi grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose .
slowly nerving himself , he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the kitchen .
but he did not complete the walk , because what he sought was no longer there .
it had come to meet him , and it was still alive after a fashion .
whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external forces , ammi could not say ; but the death had been at it .
everything had happened in the last , but collapse , greying , and disintegration were already far advanced .
there was a horrible brittleness , and dry fragments were scaling off .
ammi could not touch it , but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that had been a face .
what was it , nahum what was it ?
he whispered , and the cleft , bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answer .
nothin ' nothin ' the colour it burns cold an ' wet , but it burns it lived in the well i seen it a kind of smoke jest like the flowers last spring the well shone at night thad an ' merwin an ' zenas everything alive suckin ' the life out of everything in that stone it must a ' come in that stone pizened the whole place du know what it wants that round thing them men from the college dug outen the stone they smashed it it was the same colour jest the same , like the flowers an ' plants must a ' ben more of seeds seeds they growed i seen it the fust time this week must a ' got strong on zenas he was a big boy , full o ' life it beats down your mind an ' then gets ye burns ye up in the well water you was right about that evil water zenas never come back from the well ca git away draws ye ye know comin ' but tai no use i seen it time an ' agin senct zenas was took whar nabby , ammi ? my head no good du know how long sense i fed her it git her ef we ai keerful jest a colour her face is gittin ' to hev that colour sometimes towards night an ' it burns an ' sucks it come from some place whar things ai as they is here one o ' them professors said so he was right look out , ammi , it do suthin ' more sucks the life out but that was all .
that which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in .
ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and reeled out the back door into the fields .
he climbed the slope to the pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods .
he could not pass that well from which his horses had run away .
he had looked at it through the window , and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim .
then the lurching buggy had not dislodged anything after all the splash had been something else something which went into the well after it had done with poor nahum .
when ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before him and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety .
reassuring her without explanations , he set out at once for arkham and notified the authorities that the gardner family was no more .
he indulged in no details , but merely told of the deaths of nahum and nabby , that of thaddeus being already known , and mentioned that the cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the .
he also stated that merwin and zenas had disappeared .
there was considerable questioning at the police station , and in the end ammi was compelled to take three officers to the gardner farm , together with the coroner , the medical examiner , and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals .
he went much against his will , for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place , but it was some comfort to have so many people with him .
the six men drove out in a , following ammi buggy , and arrived at the farmhouse about four .
used as the officers were to gruesome experiences , not one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below .
the whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough , but those two crumbling objects were beyond all bounds .
no one could look long at them , and even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine .
specimens could be analysed , of course , so he busied himself in obtaining them and here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken .
under the spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum , in which many of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in the previous year .
the property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month , the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonates .
ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant to do anything then and there .
it was getting toward sunset , and he was anxious to be away .
but he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the great sweep , and when a detective questioned him he admitted that nahum had feared something down there so much so that he had never even thought of searching it for merwin or zenas .
after that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well immediately , so ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside .
the men sniffed in disgust at the fluid , and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were uncovering .
it was not so long a job as they had feared it would be , since the water was phenomenally low .
there is no need to speak too exactly of what they found .
merwin and zenas were both there , in part , though the vestiges were mainly skeletal .
there were also a small deer and a large dog in about the same state , and a number of bones of small animals .
the ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling , and a man who descended on with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstruction .
twilight had now fallen , and lanterns were brought from the house .
then , when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well , everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient while the intermittent light of a spectral played wanly on the grey desolation outside .
the men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case , and could find no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions , the unknown disease of and humans , and the unaccountable deaths of merwin and zenas in the tainted well .
they had heard the common country talk , it is true ; but could not believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred .
no doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil , but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter .
was it the well water ?
very possibly .
it might be a good idea to analyze it .
but what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well ?
their deeds were so the fragments showed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death .
why was everything so grey and brittle ?
it was the coroner , seated near a window overlooking the yard , who first noticed the glow about the well .
night had fully set in , and all the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams ; but this new glow was something definite and distinct , and appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight , giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where the water had been emptied .
it had a very queer colour , and as all the men clustered round the window ammi gave a violent start .
for this strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue .
he had seen that colour before , and feared to think what it might mean .
he had seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers ago , had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime , and had thought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had happened .
it had flashed there a second , and a clammy and hateful current of vapour had brushed past him and then poor nahum had been taken by something of that colour .
he had said so at the last said it was like the globule and the plants .
after that had come the runaway in the yard and the splash in the well and now that well was belching forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint .
it does credit to the alertness of ammi mind that he puzzled even at that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific .
he could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime , against a window opening on the morning sky , and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape .
it was right it was against nature and he thought of those terrible last words of his stricken friend , it come from some place whar things ai as they is here one o ' them professors said so all three horses outside , tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road , were now neighing and pawing frantically .
the wagon driver started for the door to do something , but ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder .
du go out thar , he whispered .
they more to this nor what we know .
nahum said somethin ' lived in the well that sucks your life out .
he said it must be growed from a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago june .
sucks an ' burns , he said , an ' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now , that ye can hardly see an ' ca tell what it is .
nahum thought it feeds on everything livin ' an ' gits stronger all the time .
he said he seen it this last week .
it must be somethin ' from away off in the sky like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was .
the way it made an ' the way it works ai like no way o ' god world .
it from beyond .
so the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy .
it was truly an awful moment ; with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself , four monstrous sets of fragments two from the house and two from the well in the woodshed behind , and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front .
ammi had restrained the driver on impulse , forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room , but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did .
no one will ever know what was abroad that night ; and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind , there is no telling what it might not have done at that last moment , and with its seemingly increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the moonlit sky .
all at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short , sharp gasp .
the others looked at him , and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested .
there was no need for words .
what had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer , and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on , that the strange days are never talked about in arkham .
it is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening .
one did arise not long afterward , but there was absolutely none then .
even the dry tips of the lingering , grey and blighted , and the fringe on the roof of the standing were unstirred .
and yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving .
they were twitching morbidly and spasmodically , clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds ; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some allied and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black roots .
not a man breathed for several seconds .
then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon , and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily .
at this there was a general cry ; muffled with awe , but husky and almost identical from every throat .
for the terror had not faded with the silhouette , and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that tree top height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance , tipping each bough like the fire of elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles ' heads at pentecost .
it was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light , like a glutted swarm of fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh , and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which ammi had come to recognize and dread .
all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter , bringing to the minds of the huddled men , a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form .
it was no longer shining out ; it was pouring out ; and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the sky .
the veterinary shivered , and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it .
ammi shook no less , and had to tug and point for lack of controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees .
the neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful , but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward .
with the moments the shining of the trees increased , while their restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality .
the wood of the was shining now , and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds and near the stone wall on the west .
they were commencing to shine , too , though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected .
then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road , and as ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realized that the span of frantic greys had broken their sapling and run off with the .
the shock served to loosen several tongues , and embarrassed whispers were exchanged .
it spreads on everything organic that been around here , muttered the medical examiner .
no one replied , but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible .
it was awful , he added .
there was no bottom at all .
just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there .
ammi horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the road outside , and nearly drowned its owner faint quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections .
it come from that stone it growed down thar it got everything livin ' it fed itself on , mind and body thad an ' merwin , zenas an ' nabby nahum was the last they all drunk the water it got strong on it come from beyond , whar things ai like they be here now it goin ' home at this point , as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator described differently , there came from poor tethered hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a horse .
every person in that sitting room stopped his ears , and ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea .
words could not convey it when ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy .
that was the last of hero till they buried him next day .
but the present was no time to mourn , for almost at this instant a detective silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them .
in the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment .
it glowed on the floor and the fragment of rag carpet , and shimmered over the sashes of the windows .
it ran up and down the exposed , coruscated about the shelf and mantel , and infected the very doors and furniture .
each minute saw it strengthen , and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that house .
ammi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the pasture .
they walked and stumbled as in a dream , and did not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground .
they were glad of the path , for they could not have gone the front way , by that well .
it was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds , and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled , fiendish contours ; but thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up .
the moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge over chapman brook , and it was blind groping from there to the open meadows .
when they looked back toward the valley and the distant gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight .
at the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour ; trees , buildings , and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness .
the boughs were all straining skyward , tipped with tongues of foul flame , and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house , barn and sheds .
it was a scene from a vision of fuseli , and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness , that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the well seething , feeling , lapping , reaching , scintillating , straining , and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognizable chromaticism .
then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor , leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out .
no watcher can ever forget that sight , and ammi stared blankly at the stars of cygnus , deneb twinkling above the others , where the unknown colour had melted into the milky way .
but his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley .
it was just that .
only a wooden ripping and crackling , and not an explosion , as so many others of the party vowed .
yet the outcome was the same , for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance ; blurring the glance of the few who saw it , and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown .
through quickly reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished , and in another second they had vanished too .
behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return , and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black , frore gusts from interstellar space .
it shrieked and howled , and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy , till soon the trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to show what was left down there at nahum .
too awed even to hint theories , the seven shaking men trudged back toward arkham by the north road .
ammi was worse than his fellows , and begged them to see him inside his own kitchen , instead of keeping straight on to town .
he did not wish to cross the blighted , woods alone to his home on the main road .
for he had had an added shock that the others were spared , and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come .
as the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set their faces toward the road , ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his friend .
and from that stricken , spot he had seen something feebly rise , only to sink down again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the sky .
it was just a colour but not any colour of our earth or heavens .
and because ammi recognized that colour , and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down there in the well , he has never been quite right since .
ammi would never go near the place again .
it is years now since the horror happened , but he has never been there , and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out .
i shall be glad , too , for i do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well i passed .
i hope the water will always be very deep but even so , i shall never drink it .
i do not think i shall visit the arkham country hereafter .
three of the men who had been with ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight , but there were not any real ruins .
only the bricks of the chimney , the stones of the cellar , some mineral and metallic litter here and there , and the rim of that nefandous well .
save for ammi dead horse , which they towed away and buried , and the buggy which they shortly returned to him , everything that had ever been living had gone .
five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained , nor has anything ever grown there since .
to this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields , and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it the blasted heath .
the rural tales are queer .
they might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from that disused well , or the grey dust that no wind seems to disperse .
botanists , too , ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot , for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreading little by little , perhaps an inch a year .
people say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in the spring , and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow .
snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere .
horses the few that are left in this motor age grow skittish in the silent valley ; and hunters can not depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust .
they say the mental influences are very bad , too ; numbers went queer in the years after nahum taking , and always they lacked the power to get away .
then the folk all left the region , and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads .
they could not stay , though ; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild , weird stories of whispered magic have given them .
their dreams at night , they protest , are very horrible in that grotesque country ; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy .
no traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines , and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye .
i myself am curious about the sensation i derived from my one lone walk before ammi told me his tale .
when twilight came i had vaguely wished some clouds would gather , for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul .
do not ask me for my opinion .
i do not know that is all .
there was no one but ammi to question ; for arkham people will not talk about the strange days , and all three professors who saw the aerolite and its coloured globule are dead .
there were other globules depend upon that .
one must have fed itself and escaped , and probably there was another which was too late .
no doubt it is still down the well i know there was something wrong with the sunlight i saw above the miasmal brink .
the rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year , so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now .
but whatever demon hatchling is there , it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread .
is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air ?
one of the current arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night .
what it is , only god knows .
in terms of matter i suppose the thing ammi described would be called a gas , but this gas obeyed the laws that are not of our cosmos .
this was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories .
this was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure .
it was just a colour out of space a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all nature as we know it ; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes .
i doubt very much if ammi consciously lied to me , and i do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned .
something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor , and something terrible though i know not in what proportion still remains .
i shall be glad to see the water come .
meanwhile i hope nothing will happen to ammi .
he saw so much of the thing and its influence was so insidious .
why has he never been able to move away ?
how clearly he recalled those dying words of nahum ca git away draws ye ye know comin ' but tai no use .
ammi is such a good old man when the reservoir gang gets to work i must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him .
i would hate to think of him as the grey , twisted , brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep .
of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival a survival of a hugely remote period when consciousness was manifested , perhaps , in shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity forms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called them gods , monsters , mythical beings of all sorts and kinds algernon blackwood i .
the horror in clay the most merciful thing in the world , i think , is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents .
we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity , and it was not meant that we should voyage far .
the sciences , each straining in its own direction , have hitherto harmed us little ; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality , and of our frightful position therein , that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age .
theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents .
they have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism .
but it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when i think of it and maddens me when i dream of it .
that glimpse , like all dread glimpses of truth , flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor .
i hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out ; certainly , if i live , i shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain .
i think that the professor , too , intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew , and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him .
my knowledge of the thing began in the winter of with the death of my , george gammell angell , professor emeritus of semitic languages in brown university , providence , rhode island .
professor angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions , and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums ; so that his passing at the age of may be recalled by many .
locally , interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death .
the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat ; falling suddenly ; as witnesses said , after having been jostled by a negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased home in williams street .
physicians were unable to find any visible disorder , but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart , induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man , was responsible for the end .
at the time i saw no reason to dissent from this dictum , but latterly i am inclined to wonder and more than wonder .
as my heir and executor , for he died a childless widower , i was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness ; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in boston .
much of the material which i correlated will be later published by the american archaeological society , but there was one box which i found exceedingly puzzling , and which i felt much averse from showing to other eyes .
it had been locked and i did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried in his pocket .
then , indeed , i succeeded in opening it , but when i did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier .
for what could be the meaning of the queer clay and the disjointed jottings , ramblings , and cuttings which i found ?
had my uncle , in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures ?
i resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man peace of mind .
the was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area ; obviously of modern origin .
its designs , however , were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion ; for , although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild , they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing .
and writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be ; though my memory , despite much the papers and collections of my uncle , failed in any way to identify this particular species , or even hint at its remotest affiliations .
above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent , though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature .
it seemed to be a sort of monster , or symbol representing a monster , of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive .
if i say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus , a dragon , and a human caricature , i shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing .
a pulpy , tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings ; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful .
behind the figure was a vague suggestions of a cyclopean architectural background .
the writing accompanying this oddity was , aside from a stack of press cuttings , in professor angell most recent hand ; and made no pretense to literary style .
what seemed to be the main document was headed in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so .
this manuscript was divided into two sections , the first of which was headed dream and dream work of .
wilcox , thomas , providence , r .

the other manuscript papers were brief notes , some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons , some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines ( notably atlantis and the lost lemuria ) , and the rest comments on secret societies and hidden cults , with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological as frazer golden bough and miss murray in western europe .
the cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of .
the first half of the principal manuscript told a very particular tale .
it appears that on march , , a thin , dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon professor angell bearing the singular clay , which was then exceedingly damp and fresh .
his card bore the name of henry anthony wilcox , and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him , who had latterly been studying sculpture at the rhode island school of design and living alone at the building near that institution .
wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity , and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating .
he called himself psychically hypersensitive , but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely queer .
never mingling much with his kind , he had dropped gradually from social visibility , and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns .
even the providence art club , anxious to preserve its conservatism , had found him quite hopeless .
on the occasion of the visit , ran the professor manuscript , the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host archeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics of the .
he spoke in a dreamy , stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy ; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying , for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology .
young wilcox rejoinder , which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim , was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation , and which i have since found highly characteristic of him .
he said , it is new , indeed , for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities ; and dreams are older than brooding tyre , or the contemplative sphinx , or babylon .
it was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle .
there had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before , the most considerable felt in new england for some years ; and wilcox imagination had been keenly affected .
upon retiring , he had had an unprecedented dream of great cyclopean cities of titan blocks and monoliths , all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror .
hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars , and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice ; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound , but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters cthulhu fhtagn .
this verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell .
he questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness ; and studied with frantic intensity the on which the youth had found himself working , chilled and clad only in his night clothes , when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him .
my uncle blamed his old age , wilcox afterwards said , for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design .
many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor , especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies ; and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body .
when professor angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore , he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams .
this bore regular fruit , for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man , during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imaginery whose burden was always some terrible cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone , with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical uninscribable save as gibberish .
the two sounds frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters cthulhu and .
on march , the manuscript continued , wilcox failed to appear ; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in waterman street .
he had cried out in the night , arousing several other artists in the building , and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium .
my uncle at once telephoned the family , and from that time forward kept close watch of the case ; calling often at the thayer street office of tobey , whom he learned to be in charge .
the youth febrile mind , apparently , was dwelling on strange things ; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them .
they included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed , but touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered about .
he at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words , as repeated by tobey , convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his .
reference to this object , the doctor added , was invariably a prelude to the young man subsidence into lethargy .
his temperature , oddly enough , was not greatly above normal ; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder .
on april at about every trace of wilcox malady suddenly ceased .
he sat upright in bed , astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of march .
pronounced well by his physician , he returned to his quarters in three days ; but to professor angell he was of no further assistance .
all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery , and my uncle kept no record of his after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions .
here the first part of the manuscript ended , but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought so much , in fact , that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist .
the notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young wilcox had had his strange visitations .
my uncle , it seems , had quickly instituted a prodigiously body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence , asking for nightly reports of their dreams , and the dates of any notable visions for some time past .
the reception of his request seems to have varied ; but he must , at the very least , have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary .
this original correspondence was not preserved , but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest .
average people in society and business new england traditional salt of the earth gave an almost completely negative result , though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there , always between march and april the period of young wilcox delirium .
scientific men were little more affected , though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes , and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal .
it was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came , and i know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes .
as it was , lacking their original letters , i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions , or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see .
that is why i continued to feel that wilcox , somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed , had been imposing on the veteran scientist .
these responses from esthetes told disturbing tale .
from february to april a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things , the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor delirium .
over a fourth of those who reported anything , reported scenes and not unlike those which wilcox had described ; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last .
one case , which the note describes with emphasis , was very sad .
the subject , a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism , went violently insane on the date of young wilcox seizure , and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell .
had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number , i should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation ; but as it was , i succeeded in tracing down only a few .
all of these , however , bore out the notes in full .
i have often wondered if all the the objects of the professor questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction .
it is well that no explanation shall ever reach them .
the press cuttings , as i have intimated , touched on cases of panic , mania , and eccentricity during the given period .
professor angell must have employed a cutting bureau , for the number of extracts was tremendous , and the sources scattered throughout the globe .
here was a nocturnal suicide in london , where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry .
here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in south america , where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen .
a dispatch from california describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some glorious fulfilment which never arrives , whilst items from india speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of march .
the west of ireland , too , is full of wild rumour and legendry , and a fantastic painter named hangs a blasphemous dream landscape in the paris spring salon of .
and so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions .
a weird bunch of cuttings , all told ; and i can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which i set them aside .
but i was then convinced that young wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor .
.
the tale of inspector legrasse the older matters which had made the sculptor dream and so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript .
once before , it appears , professor angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity , puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics , and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as cthulhu ; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued young wilcox with queries and demands for data .
this earlier experience had come in , seventeen years before , when the american archaeological society held its annual meeting in louis .
professor angell , as befitted one of his authority and attainments , had had a prominent part in all the deliberations ; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution .
the chief of these outsiders , and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting , was a man who had travelled all the way from new orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source .
his name was john raymond legrasse , and he was by profession an inspector of police .
with him he bore the subject of his visit , a grotesque , repulsive , and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine .
it must not be fancied that inspector legrasse had the least interest in archaeology .
on the contrary , his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations .
the statuette , idol , fetish , or whatever it was , had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of new orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting ; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it , that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them , and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the african voodoo circles .
of its origin , apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members , absolutely nothing was to be discovered ; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol , and through it track down the cult to its .
inspector legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created .
one sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement , and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas .
no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object , yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone .
the figure , which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study , was between seven and eight inches in height , and of exquisitely artistic workmanship .
it represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline , but with an head whose face was a mass of feelers , a scaly , body , prodigious claws on hind and fore feet , and long , narrow wings behind .
this thing , which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy , was of a somewhat bloated corpulence , and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters .
the tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block , the seat occupied the centre , whilst the long , curved claws of the , crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal .
the cephalopod head was bent forward , so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher elevated knees .
the aspect of the whole was abnormally , and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown .
its vast , awesome , and incalculable age was unmistakable ; yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation youth or indeed to any other time .
totally separate and apart , its very material was a mystery ; for the soapy , stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy .
the characters along the base were equally baffling ; and no member present , despite a representation of half the world expert learning in this field , could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship .
they , like the subject and material , belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it , something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part .
and yet , as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector problem , there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing , and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew .
this person was the late william channing webb , professor of anthropology in princeton university , and an explorer of no slight note .
professor webb had been engaged , years before , in a tour of greenland and iceland in search of some runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth ; and whilst high up on the west greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate esquimaux whose religion , a curious form of , chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness .
it was a faith of which other esquimaux knew little , and which they mentioned only with shudders , saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made .
besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk ; and of this professor webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or , expressing the sounds in roman letters as best he knew how .
but just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished , and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs .
it was , the professor stated , a very crude of stone , comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing .
and so far as he could tell , it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting .
this data , received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members , proved doubly exciting to inspector legrasse ; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions .
having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp his men had arrested , he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist esquimaux .
there then followed an exhaustive comparison of details , and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart .
what , in substance , both the esquimaux wizards and the louisiana had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this the being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud cthulhu fhtagn .
legrasse had one point in advance of professor webb , for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant .
this text , as given , ran something like this in his house at dead cthulhu waits dreaming .
and now , in response to a general and urgent demand , inspector legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers ; telling a story to which i could see my uncle attached profound significance .
it savoured of the wildest dreams of and theosophist , and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it .
on november , , there had come to the new orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south .
the squatters there , mostly primitive but descendants of lafitte men , were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night .
it was voodoo , apparently , but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known ; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured .
there were insane shouts and harrowing screams , chants and dancing ; and , the frightened messenger added , the people could stand it no more .
so a body of twenty police , filling two carriages and an automobile , had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide .
at the end of the passable road they alighted , and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came .
ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of spanish moss beset them , and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create .
at length the squatter settlement , a miserable huddle of huts , hove in sight ; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns .
the muffled beat of was now faintly audible far , far ahead ; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted .
a reddish glare , too , seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues of forest night .
reluctant even to be left alone again , each one of the cowed squatters refused to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship , so inspector legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before .
the region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute , substantially unknown and untraversed by white men .
there were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight , in which dwelt a huge , formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes ; and squatters whispered that devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight .
they said it had been there before , before la salle , before the indians , and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods .
it was nightmare itself , and to see it was to die .
but it made men dream , and so they knew enough to keep away .
the present voodoo orgy was , indeed , on the merest fringe of this abhorred area , but that location was bad enough ; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents .
only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by legrasse men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled .
there are vocal qualities peculiar to men , and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts ; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other .
animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell .
now and then the less organized ululation would cease , and from what seemed a chorus of hoarse voices would rise in chant that hideous phrase or ritual cthulhu fhtagn .
then the men , having reached a spot where the trees were thinner , came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself .
four of them reeled , one fainted , and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened .
legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man , and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror .
in a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre extent , clear of trees and tolerably dry .
on this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a sime or an angarola could paint .
void of clothing , this hybrid spawn were braying , bellowing , and writhing about a monstrous bonfire ; in the centre of which , revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame , stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height ; on top of which , incongruous in its diminutiveness , rested the noxious carven statuette .
from a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the monolith as a centre hung , head downward , the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared .
it was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared , the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire .
it may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men , an excitable spaniard , to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror .
this man , joseph galvez , i later met and questioned ; and he proved distractingly imaginative .
he indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings , and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but i suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition .
actually , the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration .
duty came first ; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng , the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout .
for five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description .
wild blows were struck , shots were fired , and escapes were made ; but in the end legrasse was able to count some sullen prisoners , whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen .
five of the worshippers lay dead , and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their .
the image on the monolith , of course , was carefully removed and carried back by legrasse .
examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness , the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low , , and mentally aberrant type .
most were seamen , and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes , largely west indians or brava portuguese from the cape verde islands , gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult .
but before many questions were asked , it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved .
degraded and ignorant as they were , the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith .
they worshipped , so they said , the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men , and who came to the young world out of the sky .
those old ones were gone now , inside the earth and under the sea ; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men , who formed a cult which had never died .
this was that cult , and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist , hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu , from his dark house in the mighty city of under the waters , should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway .
some day he would call , when the stars were ready , and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him .
meanwhile no more must be told .
there was a secret which even torture could not extract .
mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth , for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few .
but these were not the great old ones .
no man had ever seen the old ones .
the carven idol was great cthulhu , but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him .
no one could read the old writing now , but things were told by word of mouth .
the chanted ritual was not the secret that was never spoken aloud , only whispered .
the chant meant only this in his house at dead cthulhu waits dreaming .
only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged , and the rest were committed to various institutions .
all denied a part in the ritual murders , and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial in the haunted wood .
but of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained .
what the police did extract , came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named castro , who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of china .
old castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed .
there had been aeons when other things ruled on the earth , and they had had great cities .
remains of them , he said the deathless chinamen had told him , were still be found as cyclopean stones on islands in the pacific .
they all died vast epochs of time before men came , but there were arts which could revive them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity .
they had , indeed , come themselves from the stars , and brought their images with them .
these great old ones , castro continued , were not composed altogether of flesh and blood .
they had shape for did not this image prove it ? but that shape was not made of matter .
when the stars were right , they could plunge from world to world through the sky ; but when the stars were wrong , they could not live .
but although they no longer lived , they would never really die .
they all lay in stone houses in their great city of , preserved by the spells of mighty cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for them .
but at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate their bodies .
the spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented them from making an initial move , and they could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by .
they knew all that was occurring in the universe , for their mode of speech was transmitted thought .
even now they talked in their tombs .
when , after infinities of chaos , the first men came , the great old ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams ; for only thus could their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals .
then , whispered castro , those first men formed the cult around tall idols which the great ones showed them ; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars .
that cult would never die till the stars came right again , and the secret priests would take great cthulhu from his tomb to revive his subjects and resume his rule of earth .
the time would be easy to know , for then mankind would have become as the great old ones ; free and wild and beyond good and evil , with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy .
then the liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves , and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom .
meanwhile the cult , by appropriate rites , must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return .
in the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed old ones in dreams , but then something happened .
the great stone city , with its monoliths and sepulchres , had sunk beneath the waves ; and the deep waters , full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass , had cut off the spectral intercourse .
but memory never died , and the said that the city would rise again when the stars were right .
then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth , mouldy and shadowy , and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten .
but of them old castro dared not speak much .
he cut himself off hurriedly , and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction .
the size of the old ones , too , he curiously declined to mention .
of the cult , he said that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless desert of arabia , where irem , the city of pillars , dreams hidden and untouched .
it was not allied to the european , and was virtually unknown beyond its members .
no book had ever really hinted of it , though the deathless chinamen said that there were double meanings in the necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose , especially the couplet that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die .
legrasse , deeply impressed and not a little bewildered , had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult .
castro , apparently , had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret .
the authorities at tulane university could shed no light upon either cult or image , and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the greenland tale of professor webb .
the feverish interest aroused at the meeting by legrasse tale , corroborated as it was by the statuette , is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended ; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society .
caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture .
legrasse for some time lent the image to professor webb , but at the latter death it was returned to him and remains in his possession , where i viewed it not long ago .
it is truly a terrible thing , and unmistakably akin to the of young wilcox .
that my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor i did not wonder , for what thoughts must arise upon hearing , after a knowledge of what legrasse had learned of the cult , of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the image and the greenland devil tablet , but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by esquimaux diabolists and mongrel louisianans ?
professor angell instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural ; though privately i suspected young wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way , and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle expense .
the and cuttings collected by the professor were , of course , strong corroboration ; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what i thought the most sensible conclusions .
so , after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of legrasse , i made a trip to providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke i thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man .
wilcox still lived alone in the building in thomas street , a hideous victorian imitation of seventeenth century breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill , and under the very shadow of the finest georgian steeple in america , i found him at work in his rooms , and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic .
he will , i believe , some time be heard from as one of the great decadents ; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose , and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in painting .
dark , frail , and somewhat unkempt in aspect , he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising .
then i told him who i was , he displayed some interest ; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams , yet had never explained the reason for the study .
i did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard , but sought with some subtlety to draw him out .
in a short time i became convinced of his absolute sincerity , for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake .
they and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly , and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion .
he could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream , but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands .
it was , no doubt , the giant shape he had raved of in delirium .
that he really knew nothing of the hidden cult , save from what my uncle relentless catechism had let fall , he soon made clear ; and again i strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions .
he talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion ; making me see with terrible vividness the damp cyclopean city of slimy green stone whose geometry , he oddly said , was all wrong and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless , calling from underground cthulhu fhtagn , cthulhu fhtagn .
these words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead cthulhu in his stone vault at , and i felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs .
wilcox , i was sure , had heard of the cult in some casual way , and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining .
later , by virtue of its sheer impressiveness , it had found subconscious expression in dreams , in the , and in the terrible statue i now beheld ; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one .
the youth was of a type , at once slightly affected and slightly , which i could never like , but i was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty .
i took leave of him amicably , and wish him all the success his talent promises .
the matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me , and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections .
i visited new orleans , talked with legrasse and others of that , saw the frightful image , and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived .
old castro , unfortunately , had been dead for some years .
what i now heard so graphically at , though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written , excited me afresh ; for i felt sure that i was on the track of a very real , very secret , and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note .
my attitude was still one of absolute materialism , as i wish it still were , and i discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by professor angell .
one thing i began to suspect , and which i now fear i know , is that my uncle death was far from natural .
he fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels , after a careless push from a negro sailor .
i did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the in louisiana , and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and rites and beliefs .
legrasse and his men , it is true , have been let alone ; but in norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead .
might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor data have come to sinister ears ?
i think professor angell died because he knew too much , or because he was likely to learn too much .
whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen , for i have learned much now .
.
the madness from the sea if heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon , it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of .
it was nothing on which i would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round , for it was an old number of an australian journal , the sydney bulletin for april , .
it had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle research .
i had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the cthulhu cult , and was visiting a learned friend in paterson , new jersey ; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note .
examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum , my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones .
it was the sydney bulletin i have mentioned , for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts ; and the picture was a cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which legrasse had found in the swamp .
eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents , i scanned the item in detail ; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length .
what it suggested , however , was of portentous significance to my flagging quest ; and i carefully tore it out for immediate action .
it read as follows vigilant arrives with helpless armed new zealand yacht in tow .
one survivor and dead man found aboard .
tale of desperate battle and deaths at sea .
rescued seaman refuses particulars of strange experience .
odd idol found in his possession .
inquiry to follow .
the morrison freighter vigilant , bound from valparaiso , arrived this morning at its wharf in darling harbour , having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht alert of dunedin , , which was sighted april in latitude ' , longitude ' , with one living and one dead man aboard .
the vigilant left valparaiso march , and on april was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves .
on april the derelict was sighted ; and though apparently deserted , was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week .
the living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin , about foot in height , regarding whose nature authorities at sydney university , the royal society , and the museum in college street all profess complete bafflement , and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht , in a small carved shrine of common pattern .
this man , after recovering his senses , told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter .
he is gustaf johansen , a norwegian of some intelligence , and had been second mate of the schooner emma of auckland , which sailed for callao february with a complement of eleven men .
the emma , he says , was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of march , and on march , in latitude ' longitude ' , encountered the alert , manned by a queer and crew of kanakas and .
being ordered peremptorily to turn back , capt .
collins refused ; whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht equipment .
the emma men showed fight , says the survivor , and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her , grappling with the savage crew on the yacht deck , and being forced to kill them all , the number being slightly superior , because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting .
three of the emma men , including capt .
collins and first mate green , were killed ; and the remaining eight under second mate johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht , going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed .
the next day , it appears , they raised and landed on a small island , although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean ; and six of the men somehow died ashore , though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story , and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm .
later , it seems , he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her , but were beaten about by the storm of april , from that time till his rescue on the the man remembers little , and he does not even recall when william briden , his companion , died .
briden death reveals no apparent cause , and was probably due to excitement or exposure .
cable advices from dunedin report that the alert was well known there as an island trader , and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront , it was owned by a curious group of whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity ; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of march .
our auckland correspondent gives the emma and her crew an excellent reputation , and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man .
the admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow , at which every effort will be made to induce johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto .
this was all , together with the picture of the hellish image ; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind !
here were new treasuries of data on the cthulhu cult , and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land .
what motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol ?
what was the unknown island on which six of the emma crew had died , and about which the mate johansen was so secretive ?
what had the investigation brought out , and what was known of the noxious cult in dunedin ?
and most marvellous of all , what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle ?
march or february according to the international date line the earthquake and storm had come .
from dunedin the alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned , and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange , dank cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded cthulhu .
march the crew of the emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead ; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster malign pursuit , whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium !
and what of this storm of april the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased , and wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever ?
what of all this and of those hints of old castro about the sunken , old ones and their coming reign ; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams ?
was i tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man power to bear ?
if so , they must be horrors of the mind alone , for in some way the second of april had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind soul .
that evening , after a day of hurried cabling and arranging , i bade my host adieu and took a train for san francisco .
in less than a month i was in dunedin ; where , however , i found that little was known of the strange who had lingered in the old .
waterfront scum was far too common for special mention ; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made , during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills .
in auckland i learned that johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney , and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo .
of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials , and all they could do was to give me his oslo address .
after that i went to sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the court .
i saw the alert , now sold and in commercial use , at circular quay in sydney cove , but gained nothing from its bulk .
the crouching image with its cuttlefish head , dragon body , scaly wings , and hieroglyphed pedestal , was preserved in the museum at hyde park ; and i studied it long and well , finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship , and with the same utter mystery , terrible antiquity , and unearthly strangeness of material which i had noted in legrasse smaller specimen .
geologists , the curator told me , had found it a monstrous puzzle ; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it .
then i thought with a shudder of what old castro had told legrasse about the old ones ; they had come from the stars , and had brought their images with them .
shaken with such a mental resolution as i had never before known , i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo .
sailing for london , i reembarked at once for the norwegian capital ; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the egeberg .
johansen address , i discovered , lay in the old town of king harold haardrada , which kept alive the name of oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as christiana .
i made the brief trip by taxicab , and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front .
a woman in black answered my summons , and i was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting english that gustaf johansen was no more .
he had not long survived his return , said his wife , for the doings at sea in had broken him .
he had told her no more than he told the public , but had left a long manuscript of technical matters as he said written in english , evidently in order to guard her from the peril of casual perusal .
during a walk through a narrow lane near the gothenburg dock , a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down .
two lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet , but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead .
physicians found no adequate cause the end , and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution .
i now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till i , too , am at rest ; accidentally or otherwise .
persuading the widow that my connection with her husband technical matters was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript , i bore the document away and began to read it on the london boat .
it was a simple , rambling thing a naive sailor effort at a diary and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage .
i can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance , but i will tell its gist enough to show why the sound the water against the vessel sides became so unendurable to me that i stopped my ears with cotton .
johansen , thank god , did not know quite all , even though he saw the city and the thing , but i shall never sleep calmly again when i think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space , and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea , known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them upon the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air .
johansen voyage had begun just as he told it to the .
the emma , in ballast , had cleared auckland on february , and had felt the full force of that tempest which must have heaved up from the the horrors that filled men dreams .
once more under control , the ship was making good progress when held up by the alert on march , and i could feel the mate regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking .
of the swarthy on the alert he speaks with significant horror .
there was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty , and johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry .
then , driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under johansen command , the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea , and in latitude ' , longitude ' , come upon a coastline of mingled mud , ooze , and weedy cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth supreme terror the nightmare of , that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast , loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars .
there lay great cthulhu and his hordes , hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last , after cycles incalculable , the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration .
all this johansen did not suspect , but god knows he soon saw enough !
i suppose that only a single , the hideous citadel whereon great cthulhu was buried , actually emerged from the waters .
when i think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith .
johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping babylon of elder daemons , and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet .
awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks , at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith , and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and with the queer image found in the shrine on the alert , is poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened description .
without knowing what futurism is like , johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city ; for instead of describing any definite structure or building , he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth , and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs .
i mention his talk about angles because it suggests something wilcox had told me of his awful dreams .
he said that the geometry of the he saw was abnormal , , and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours .
now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality .
johansen and his men landed at a sloping on this monstrous acropolis , and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase .
the very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this perversion , and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity .
something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen .
each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others , and it was only that they searched vainly , as it proved for some portable souvenir to bear away .
it was rodriguez the portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found .
the rest followed him , and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar .
it was , johansen said , like a great ; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel , threshold , and jambs around it , though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a or slantwise like an outside .
as wilcox would have said , the geometry of the place was all wrong .
one could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal , hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable .
briden pushed at the stone in several places without result .
then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge , pressing each point separately as he went .
he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding that is , one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast .
then , very softly and slowly , the lintel began to give inward at the top ; and they saw that it was balanced .
donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows , and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal .
in this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way , so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset .
the aperture was black with a darkness almost material .
that tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality ; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed , and actually burst forth like smoke from its imprisonment , visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings .
the odour rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable , and at length the hawkins thought he heard a nasty , slopping sound down there .
everyone listened , and everyone was listening still when it lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness .
poor johansen handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this .
of the six men who never reached the ship , he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant .
the thing can not be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy , such eldritch contradictions of all matter , force , and cosmic order .
a mountain walked or stumbled .
god !
what wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad , and poor wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant ?
the thing of the idols , the green , sticky spawn of the stars , had awaked to claim his own .
the stars were right again , and what an cult had failed to do by design , a band of innocent sailors had done by accident .
after vigintillions of years great cthulhu was loose again , and ravening for delight .
three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned .
god rest them , if there be any rest in the universe .
they were donovan , guerrera , and angstrom .
parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of rock to the boat , and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which should have been there ; an angle which was acute , but behaved as if it were obtuse .
so only briden and johansen reached the boat , and pulled desperately for the alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated , floundering at the edge of the water .
steam had not been suffered to go down entirely , despite the departure of all hands for the shore ; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the alert under way .
slowly , amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene , she began to churn the lethal waters ; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus .
then , bolder than the storied cyclops , great cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast strokes of cosmic potency .
briden looked back and went mad , laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriously .
but johansen had not given out yet .
knowing that the thing could surely overtake the alert until steam was fully up , he resolved on a desperate chance ; and , setting the engine for full speed , ran on deck and reversed the wheel .
there was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine , and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon .
the awful with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht , but johansen drove on relentlessly .
there was a bursting as of an exploding bladder , a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish , a stench as of a thousand opened graves , and a sound that the chronicler could not put on paper .
for an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud , and then there was only a venomous seething astern ; where god in heaven ! the scattered plasticity of that nameless was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form , whilst its distance widened every second as the alert gained impetus from its mounting steam .
that was all .
after that johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side .
he did not try to navigate after the first bold flight , for the reaction had taken something out of his soul .
then came the storm of april , and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness .
there is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity , of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail , and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit , all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted , hilarious elder gods and the green , mocking imps of tartarus .
out of that dream came rescue the vigilant , the court , the streets of dunedin , and the long voyage back home to the old house by the egeberg .
he could not tell they would think him mad .
he would write of what he knew before death came , but his wife must not guess .
death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories .
that was the document i read , and now i have placed it in the tin box beside the and the papers of professor angell .
with it shall go this record of mine this test of my own sanity , wherein is pieced together that which i hope may never be pieced together again .
i have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror , and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me .
but i do not think my life will be long .
as my uncle went , as poor johansen went , so i shall go .
i know too much , and the cult still lives .
cthulhu still lives , too , i suppose , again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young .
his accursed city is sunken once more , for the vigilant sailed over the spot after the april storm ; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around monoliths in lonely places .
he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss , or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy .
who knows the end ?
what has risen may sink , and what has sunk may rise .
loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep , and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men .
a time will come but i must not and can not think !
let me pray that , if i do not survive this manuscript , my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye .
gorgons and hydras , and chimaeras dire stories of celaeno and the harpies may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition but they were there before .
they are transcripts , types the archetypes are in us , and eternal .
how else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us all ?
is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects , considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury ?
o , least of all !
these terrors are of older standing .
they date beyond body or without the body , they would have been the same that the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth , that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy are difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our condition , and a peep at least into the shadowland of .

when a traveller in north central massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of aylesbury pike just beyond dean corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country .
the ground gets higher , and the stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty , curving road .
the trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large , and the wild weeds , brambles and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions .
at the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren ; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age , squalor , and dilapidation .
without knowing why , one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping , meadows .
those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things , with which it would be better to have nothing to do .
when a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods , the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased .
the summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned .
gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety .
when the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes , and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping .
the thin , shining line of the miskatonic upper reaches has an oddly suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises .
as the hills draw nearer , one heeds their wooded sides more than their tops .
those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance , but there is no road by which to escape them .
across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain , and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region .
it is not reassuring to see , on a closer glance , that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin , and that the church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet .
one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there is no way to avoid it .
once across , it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odour about the village street , as of the massed mould and decay of centuries .
it is always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike .
afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwich .
outsiders visit dunwich as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down .
the scenery , judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon , is more than commonly beautiful ; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists .
two centuries ago , when talk of , , and strange forest presences was not laughed at , it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality .
in our sensible age since the dunwich horror of was hushed up by those who had the town and the world welfare at heart people shun it without knowing exactly why .
perhaps one reason though it can not apply to uninformed strangers is that the natives are now repellently decadent , having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many new england backwaters .
they have come to form a race by themselves , with the mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding .
the average of their intelligence is woefully low , whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of murders , incests , and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity .
the old gentry , representing the two or three armigerous families which came from salem in , have kept somewhat above the general level of decay ; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace .
some of the whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to harvard and miskatonic , though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born .
no one , even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror , can say just what is the matter with dunwich ; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the indians , amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills , and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below .
in the reverend abijah hoadley , newly come to the congregational church at dunwich village , preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of satan and his imps ; in which he said it must be allow , that these blasphemies of an infernall train of daemons are matters of too common knowledge to be deny ; the cursed voices of azazel and buzrael , of beelzebub and belial , being heard now from under ground by above a score of credible witnesses now living .
i myself did not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain discourse of evill powers in the hill behind my house ; wherein there were a rattling and rolling , groaning , screeching , and hissing , such as no things of this earth could raise up , and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magick can discover , and only the divell unlock .
hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon , but the text , printed in springfield , is still extant .
noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year , and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers .
other traditions tell of foul odours near the circles of stone pillars , and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines ; while still others try to explain the devil hop yard a bleak , blasted hillside where no tree , shrub , or will grow .
then , too , the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights .
it is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying , and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer struggling breath .
if they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body , they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter ; but if they fail , they subside gradually into a disappointed silence .
these tales , of course , are obsolete and ridiculous ; because they come down from very old times .
dunwich is indeed ridiculously old older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it .
south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house , which was built before ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls , built in , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen .
industry did not flourish here , and the factory movement proved .
oldest of all are the great rings of stone columns on the hilltops , but these are more generally attributed to the indians than to the settlers .
deposits of skulls and bones , found within these circles and around the sizeable rock on sentinel hill , sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the of the pocumtucks ; even though many ethnologists , disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory , persist in believing the remains caucasian .
.
it was in the township of dunwich , in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling , that wilbur whateley was born at on sunday , the second of february , .
this date was recalled because it was candlemas , which people in dunwich curiously observe under another name ; and because the noises in the hills had sounded , and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently , throughout the night before .
less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent whateleys , a somewhat deformed , unattractive albino woman of , living with an aged and father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth .
lavinia whateley had no known husband , but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child ; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might and did speculate as widely as they chose .
on the contrary , she seemed strangely proud of the dark , infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and albinism , and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future .
lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things , for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of whateleys , and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes .
she had never been to school , but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that old whateley had taught her .
the remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old whateley reputation for black magic , and the unexplained death by violence of mrs whateley when lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular .
isolated among strange influences , lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose and singular occupations ; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared .
there was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs ' barking on the night wilbur was born , but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming .
neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward , when old whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into dunwich village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at osborne general store .
there seemed to be a change in the old man an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event .
amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter , and what he said of the child paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward .
' i du keer what folks think ef lavinny boy looked like his pa , he would look like nothin ' ye expeck .
ye need think the only folks is the folks hereabouts .
lavinny read some , an ' has seed some things the most o ' ye only tell abaout .
i her man is as good a husban ' as ye kin find this side of aylesbury ; an ' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as i dew , ye would ast no better church weddin ' nor .
let me tell ye suthin some day yew folks hear a child o ' lavinny ' its father name on the top o ' sentinel hill ! '
the only person who saw wilbur during the first month of his life were old zechariah whateley , of the undecayed whateleys , and earl sawyer wife , mamie bishop .
mamie visit was frankly one of curiosity , and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations ; but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis .
this marked the beginning of a course of on the part of small wilbur family which ended only in , when the dunwich horror came and went ; yet at no time did the ramshackle whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock .
there came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old , and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic , specimens .
evidently some blight or distemper , perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn , caused a heavy mortality amongst the whateley animals .
odd wounds or sores , having something of the aspect of incisions , seemed to afflict the visible cattle ; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey , unshaven old man and his slattemly , albino daughter .
in the spring after wilbur birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills , bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child .
public interest in the whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby , and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit .
wilbur growth was indeed phenomenal , for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age .
his motions and even his vocal sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant , and no one was really unprepared when , at seven months , he began to walk unassisted , with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove .
it was somewhat after this time on that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill where the old stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones .
considerable talk was started when silas bishop of the undecayed bishops mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked .
silas was rounding up a stray heifer , but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern .
they darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush , and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed .
afterwards he could not be sure about the boy , who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on .
wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire , the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm .
his contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of suggested the most valid of reasons .
the next january gossips were mildly interested in the fact that black brat ' had commenced to talk , and at the age of only eleven months .
his speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region , and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud .
the boy was not talkative , yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by dunwich and its denizens .
the strangeness did not reside in what he said , or even in the simple idioms he used ; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds .
his facial aspect , too , was remarkable for its maturity ; for though he shared his mother and grandfather chinlessness , his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large , dark , almost latin eyes to give him an air of and preternatural intelligence .
he was , however , exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy ; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips , , yellowish skin , coarse crinkly hair , and oddly elongated ears .
he was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire , and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of old whateley , and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him .
dogs abhorred the boy , and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace .
.
meanwhile old whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd .
he also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house a spacious , affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside , and whose three rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter .
there must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour ; and though he still babbled dementedly at times , his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation .
it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born , when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order , clapboarded , and fitted with a stout fresh lock .
now , in restoring the abandoned upper storey of the house , he was a no less thorough craftsman .
his mania showed itself only in his tight of all the windows in the reclaimed section though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all .
less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson a room which several callers saw , though no one was ever admitted to the upper storey .
this chamber he lined with tall , firm shelving , along which he began gradually to arrange , in apparently careful order , all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms .
' i made some use of , ' he would say as he tried to mend a torn page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove , the boy fitten to make better use of .
he orter hev as well so as he kin , for they goin ' to be all of his larnin ' . '
when wilbur was a year and seven months old in september of his size and accomplishments were almost alarming .
he had grown as large as a child of four , and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker .
he ran freely about the fields and hills , and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings .
at home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather books , while old whateley would instruct and catechize him through long , hushed afternoons .
by this time the restoration of the house was finished , and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door .
it was a window in the rear of the east gable end , close against the hill ; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground .
about the period of this work completion people noticed that the old , tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since wilbur birth , had been abandoned again .
the door swung listlessly open , and when earl sawyer once stepped within after a call on old whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered such a stench , he averred , as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the indian circles on the hills , and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth .
but then , the homes and sheds of dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness .
the following months were void of visible events , save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises .
on may eve of there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt , whilst the following produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with bursts of flame witch whateleys ' ' from the summit of sentinel hill .
wilbur was growing up uncannily , so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year .
he read avidly by himself now ; but talked much less than formerly .
a settled taciturnity was absorbing him , and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face .
he would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon , and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror .
the aversion displayed towards him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark , and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety .
his occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians .
the few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor , while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the second storey .
she would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there , though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose tried the locked door leading to the stairway .
that pedlar told the store loungers at dunwich village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above .
the loungers reflected , thinking of the door and runway , and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared .
then they shuddered as they recalled tales of old whateley youth , and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods .
it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personally .
in the war came , and squire sawyer whateley , as chairman of the local draft board , had hard work finding a quota of young dunwich men fit even to be sent to development camp .
the government , alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence , sent several officers and medical experts to investigate ; conducting a survey which new england newspaper readers may still recall .
it was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the whateleys , and caused the boston globe and arkham advertiser to print flamboyant sunday stories of young wilbur precociousness , old whateley black magic , and the shelves of strange books , the sealed second storey of the ancient farmhouse , and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises .
wilbur was four and a half then , and looked like a lad of fifteen .
his lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down , and his voice had begun to break .
earl sawyer went out to the whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men , and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces .
it was , he said , exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired ; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circle on the mountains .
dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared , and grinned over the obvious mistakes .
they wondered , too , why the writers made so much of the fact that old whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date .
the whateleys had received their visitors with distaste , though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk .
.
for a decade the annals of the whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their may eve and orgies .
twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill , at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence ; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely .
in the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper storey even when all the family were downstairs , and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed .
there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it , since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world attention to themselves .
about , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind , voice , stature , and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity , a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house .
it was all inside the sealed upper part , and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor , leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey and the peaked roof .
they had torn down the great central chimney , too , and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin .
in the spring after this event old whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of cold spring glen to chirp under his window at night .
he seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance , and told the loungers at osborn that he thought his time had almost come .
whistle jest in tune with my breathin ' naow , ' he said , ' i guess they gittin ' ready to ketch my soul .
they know it ' aout , an ' du to miss it .
yew know , boys , arter i gone , whether they git me er not .
ef they dew , they keep up ' an ' laffin ' till break o ' day .
ef they du they kinder quiet daown like .
i expeck them an ' the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes . '
on lammas night , , dr houghton of aylesbury was hastily summoned by wilbur whateley , who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from osborn in the village .
he found old whateley in a very grave state , with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off .
the shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside , whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping , as of the waves on some level beach .
the doctor , though , was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside ; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man .
it was uncanny and unnatural too much , thought dr houghton , like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call .
towards one old whateley gained consciousness , and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson .
space , willy , more space soon .
yew grows an ' that grows faster .
it be ready to serve ye soon , boy .
open up the gates to with the long chant that ye find on page of the complete edition , an ' then put a match to the prison .
fire from airth ca burn it nohaow . '
he was obviously quite mad .
after a pause , during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off , he added another sentence or two .
it , willy , an ' mind the quantity ; but du let it grow too fast fer the place , fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to , it all over an ' no use .
only them from beyont kin make it multiply an ' work only them , the old uns as wants to come back ' but speech gave place to gasps again , and lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change .
it was the same for more than an hour , when the final throaty rattle came .
dr houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence .
lavinia sobbed , but wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly .
did git him , ' he muttered in his heavy bass voice .
wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his way , and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept .
he was more and more hated and dreaded around dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door ; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of gold which still , as in his grandfather time , went forth regularly and increasingly for .
he was now tremendously mature of aspect , and his height , having reached the normal adult limit , seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure .
in , when a scholarly correspondent from miskatonic university called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled , he was fully six and feet tall .
through all the years wilbur had treated his albino mother with a growing contempt , finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on may eve and hallowmass ; and in the poor creature complained to mamie bishop of being afraid of him .
more abaout him as i knows than i kin tell ye , mamie , ' she said , ' naowadays they more nor what i know myself .
i vaow afur gawd , i du know what he wants nor what he ' to dew . '
that the hill noises sounded louder than ever , and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual ; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse .
after midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside , and not until dawn did they finally quiet down .
then they vanished , hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue .
what this meant , no one could quite be certain till later .
none of the countryfolk seemed to have died but poor lavinia whateley , the twisted albino , was never seen again .
in the summer of wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them .
soon afterwards earl sawyer told the loungers at osborn that more carpentry was going on in the whateley farmhouse .
wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor , and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before .
he was living in one of the sheds , and sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous .
people generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother disappearance , and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now .
his height had increased to more than seven feet , and showed no signs of ceasing its development .
the following winter brought an event no less strange than wilbur first trip outside the dunwich region .
correspondence with the widener library at harvard , the bibliothèque nationale in paris , the british museum , the university of buenos ayres , and the library of miskatonic university at arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted ; so at length he set out in person , shabby , dirty , bearded , and uncouth of dialect , to consult the copy at miskatonic , which was the nearest to him geographically .
almost eight feet tall , and carrying a cheap new valise from osborne general store , this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library the hideous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius ' latin version , as printed in spain in the seventeenth century .
he had never seen a city before , but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds ; where indeed , he passed heedlessly by the great watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity , and tugged frantically at its stout chain .
wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of dr dee english version which his grandfather had bequeathed him , and upon receiving access to the latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the page of his own defective volume .
this much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian the same erudite henry armitage ( miskatonic , princeton , .
johns hopkins ) who had once called at the farm , and who now politely plied him with questions .
he was looking , he had to admit , for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name , and it puzzled him to find discrepancies , duplications , and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy .
as he copied the formula he finally chose , dr armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages ; the one of which , in the latin version , contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world .
nor is it to be thought ( ran the text as armitage mentally translated it ) that man is either the oldest or the last of earth masters , or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone .
the old ones were , the old ones are , and the old ones shall be .
not in the spaces we know , but between them , they walk serene and primal , undimensioned and to us unseen .
knows the gate .
is the gate .
is the key and guardian of the gate .
past , present , future , all are one in .
he knows where the old ones broke through of old , and where they shall break through again .
he knows where they had trod earth fields , and where they still tread them , and why no one can behold them as they tread .
by their smell can men sometimes know them near , but of their semblance can no man know , saving only in the features of those they have begotten on mankind ; and of those are there many sorts , differing in likeness from man truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is them .
they walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the words have been spoken and the rites howled through at their seasons .
the wind gibbers with their voices , and the earth mutters with their consciousness .
they bend the forest and crush the city , yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites .
kadath in the cold waste hath known them , and what man knows kadath ?
the ice desert of the south and the sunken isles of ocean hold stones whereon their seal is engraver , but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles ?
great cthulhu is their cousin , yet can he spy them only dimly .
iä !
!
as a foulness shall ye know them .
their hand is at your throats , yet ye see them not ; and their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold .
is the key to the gate , whereby the spheres meet .
man rules now where they ruled once ; they shall soon rule where man rules now .
after summer is winter , after winter summer .
they wait patient and potent , for here shall they reign again .
armitage , associating what he was reading with what he had heard of dunwich and its brooding presences , and of wilbur whateley and his dim , hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide , felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb cold clamminess .
the bent , goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension ; like something only partly of mankind , and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter , space and time .
presently wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange , resonant fashion which hinted at organs unlike the run of mankind .
armitage , ' he said , ' i i got to take that book home .
they things in it i got to try under sarten conditions that i ca git here , en ' it be a mortal sin to let a rule hold me up .
let me take it along , sir , an ' i swar they wu nobody know the difference .
i du need to tell ye i take good keer of it .
it wa me that put this dee copy in the shape it is ' he stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian face , and his own goatish features grew crafty .
armitage , to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed , thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself .
there was too much responsibility in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres .
whateley saw how things stood , and tried to answer lightly .
, all right , ef ye feel that way abaout it .
maybe harvard wo be so fussy as yew be . '
and without saying more he rose and strode out of the building , stooping at each doorway .
armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog , and studied whateley lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window .
he thought of the wild tales he had heard , and recalled the old sunday stories in the advertiser ; these things , and the lore he had picked up from dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there .
unseen things not of earth or at least not of tridimensional earth rushed foetid and horrible through new england glens , and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops .
of this he had long felt certain .
now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror , and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare .
he locked away the necronomicon with a shudder of disgust , but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench .
a foulness shall ye know them , ' he quoted .
yes the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the whateley farmhouse less than three years before .
he thought of wilbur , goatish and ominous , once again , and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage .
? '
armitage muttered to himself .
god , what simpletons !
show them arthur machen great god pan and they think it a common dunwich scandal !
but what thing what cursed shapeless influence on or off this earth was wilbur whateley father ?
born on candlemas nine months after may eve of , when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to arkham what walked on the mountains that may night ?
what roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in flesh and blood ? '
during the ensuing weeks dr armitage set about to collect all possible data on wilbur whateley and the formless presences around dunwich .
he got in communication with dr houghton of aylesbury , who had attended old whateley in his last illness , and found much to ponder over in the grandfather last words as quoted by the physician .
a visit to dunwich village failed to bring out much that was new ; but a close survey of the necronomicon , in those parts which wilbur had sought so avidly , seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature , methods , and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet .
talks with several students of archaic lore in boston , and letters to many others elsewhere , gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear .
as the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper miskatonic valley , and about the monstrous being known to the human world as wilbur whateley .
.
the dunwich horror itself came between lammas and the equinox in , and dr armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue .
he had heard , meanwhile , of whateley grotesque trip to cambridge , and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library .
those efforts had been in vain , since armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume .
wilbur had been shockingly nervous at cambridge ; anxious for the book , yet almost equally anxious to get home again , as if he feared the results of being away long .
early in august the outcome developed , and in the small hours of the third dr armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild , fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus .
deep and terrible , the snarling , growls and barks continued ; always in mounting volume , but with hideously significant pauses .
then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat such a scream as roused half the sleepers of arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwards such a scream as could come from no being born of earth , or wholly of earth .
armitage , hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings , saw that others were ahead of him ; and heard the echoes of a still shrilling from the library .
an open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight .
what had come had indeed completed its entrance ; for the barking and the screaming , now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning , proceeded unmistakably from within .
some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see , so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door .
among the others he saw professor warren rice and dr francis morgan , men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings ; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside .
the inward sounds , except for a watchful , droning whine from the dog , had by this time quite subsided ; but armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping , as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man .
the building was full of a frightful stench which dr armitage knew too well , and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical whence the low whining came .
for a second nobody dared to turn on the light , then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch .
one of the three it is not certain which shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs .
professor rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant , though he did not stumble or fall .
the thing that lay on its side in a foetid pool of ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall , and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin .
it was not quite dead , but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside .
bits of and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room , and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown .
near the central desk a revolver had fallen , a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired .
the thing itself , however , crowded out all other images at the time .
it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it , but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common of this planet and of the three known dimensions .
it was partly human , beyond a doubt , with very manlike hands and head , and the goatish , chinless face had the stamp of the whateley upon it .
but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous , so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated .
above the waist it was ; though its chest , where the dog rending paws still rested watchfully , had the leathery , reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator .
the back was piebald with yellow and black , and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes .
below the waist , though , it was the worst ; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began .
the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur , and from the abdomen a score of long tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply .
their arrangement was odd , and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system .
on each of the hips , deep set in a kind of pinkish , ciliated orbit , was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye ; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings , and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat .
the limbs , save for their black fur , roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth giant saurians , and terminated in pads that were neither hooves nor claws .
when the thing breathed , its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour , as if from some circulatory cause normal to the greenish tinge , whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly in the spaces between the purple rings .
of genuine blood there was none ; only the foetid ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness , and left a curious discoloration behind it .
as the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing , it began to mumble without turning or raising its head .
dr armitage made no written record of its mouthings , but asserts confidently that nothing in english was uttered .
at first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth , but towards the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the necronomicon , that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished .
these fragments , as armitage recalls them , ran something like , , , , ' they trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of unholy anticipation .
then came a halt in the gasping , and the dog raised its head in a long , lugubrious howl .
a change came over the yellow , goatish face of the prostrate thing , and the great black eyes fell in appallingly .
outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased , and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a whirring and fluttering .
against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight , frantic at that which they had sought for prey .
all at once the dog started up abruptly , gave a frightened bark , and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered .
a cry rose from the crowd , and dr armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came .
he was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in , and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one .
by this time two policemen had arrived ; and dr morgan , meeting them in the vestibule , was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up .
meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor .
one need not describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of dr armitage and professor rice ; but it is permissible to say that , aside from the external appearance of face and hands , the really human element in wilbur whateley must have been very small .
when the medical examiner came , there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards , and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared .
apparently whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton ; at least , in any true or stable sense .
he had taken somewhat after his unknown father .
.
yet all this was only the prologue of the actual dunwich horror .
formalities were gone through by bewildered officials , abnormal details were duly kept from press and public , and men were sent to dunwich and aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late wilbur whateley .
they found the countryside in great agitation , both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills , and because of the unwonted stench and the surging , lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by whateley farmhouse .
earl sawyer , who tended the horse and cattle during wilbur absence , had developed a woefully acute case of nerves .
the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place ; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased living quarters , the newly mended sheds , to a single visit .
they filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in aylesbury , and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys , decayed and undecayed , of the upper miskatonic valley .
an almost interminable manuscript in strange characters , written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship , presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner desk .
after a week of debate it was sent to miskatonic university , together with the deceased collection of strange books , for study and possible translation ; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease .
no trace of the ancient gold with which wilbur and old whateley had always paid their debts has yet been discovered .
it was in the dark of september ninth that the horror broke loose .
the hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening , and dogs barked frantically all night .
early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench in the air .
about seven luther brown , the hired boy at george corey , between cold spring glen and the village , rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to meadow with the cows .
he was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen ; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully , having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him .
between gasps luther tried to stammer out his tale to mrs corey .
thar in the rud beyont the glen , mis ' corey they suthin ' ben thar !
it smells like thunder , an ' all the bushes an ' little trees is pushed back from the rud like they a haouse ben moved along of it .
an ' that ai the wust , nuther .
they prints in the rud , mis ' corey great raound prints as big as , all sunk dawon deep like a elephant had ben along , only they a sight more nor four feet could make !
i looked at one or two afore i run , an ' i see every one was covered with lines spreadin ' aout from one place , like as if big fans twict or three times as big as any they is hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud .
an ' the smell was awful , like what it is around wizard whateley ol ' haouse ' here he faltered , and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home .
mrs corey , unable to extract more information , began telephoning the neighbours ; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors .
when she got sally sawyer , housekeeper at seth bishop , the nearest place to whateley , it became her turn to listen instead of transmit ; for sally boy chauncey , who slept poorly , had been up on the hill towards whateley , and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place , and at the pasturage where mr bishop cows had been left out all night .
, mis ' corey , ' came sally tremulous voice over the party wire , he just come back ' , and could half talk fer bein ' scairt !
he says ol ' whateley house is all bowed up , with timbers scattered raound like they ben dynamite inside ; only the bottom floor ai through , but is all covered with a kind o ' stuff that smells awful an ' drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun ' whar the side timbers is blowed away .
an ' they awful kinder marks in the yard , tew great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead , an ' all sticky with stuff like is on the haouse .
he says they leads off into the medders , whar a great swath a barn is matted daown , an ' all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes .
' he says , says he , mis ' corey , as haow he sot to look fer seth caows , frightened ez he was an ' faound in the upper pasture nigh the devil hop yard in an awful shape .
haff on clean gone , an ' nigh haff o ' them that left is sucked most dry o ' blood , with sores on like they ben on whateleys cattle ever senct lavinny black brat was born .
seth hes gone aout naow to look at , though i vaow he wo keer ter git very nigh wizard whateley !
did look keerful ter see whar the big swath led arter it leff the pasturage , but he says he thinks it towards the glen rud to the village .
' i tell ye , mis ' corey , they suthin ' abroad as had orter be abroad , an ' i for one think that black wilbur whateley , as come to the bad end he deserved , is at the bottom of the breedin ' of it .
he all human hisself , i allus says to everybody ; an ' i think he an ' ol ' whateley must a raised suthin ' in that there haouse as ai even so human as he was .
they allus ben unseen things araound dunwich livin ' things as ai human an ' ai good fer human folks .
graoun ' was ' las ' night , an ' towards mornin ' he heered the whippoorwills so laoud in col ' spring glen he could sleep nun .
then he thought he heered another saound over towards wizard whateley a kinder rippin ' or tearin ' o ' wood , like some big box er crate was bein ' opened fur off .
what with this an ' that , he did git to sleep at all till sunup , an ' no sooner was he up this mornin ' , but he got to go over to whateley an ' see what the matter .
he see enough i tell ye , mis ' corey !
this du mean no good , an ' i think as all the ought to git up a party an ' do suthin ' .
i know suthin ' awful abaout , an ' feel my time is nigh , though only gawd knows jest what it is .
your luther take accaount o ' whar them big tracks led tew ?
no ?
wal , mis ' corey , ef they was on the glen rud this side o ' the glen , an ' ai got to your haouse yet , i they must go into the glen itself .
they would do that .
i allus says col ' spring glen ai no healthy nor decent place .
the whippoorwills an ' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o ' gawd , an ' they them as says ye kin hear strange things ' an ' ' in the air dawon thar ef ye stand in the right place , atween the rock falls an ' bear den . '
by that noon fully of the men and boys of dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade whateley ruins and cold spring glen , examining in horror the vast , monstrous prints , the maimed bishop cattle , the strange , noisome wreck of the farmhouse , and the bruised , matted vegetation of the fields and roadside .
whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine ; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken , and a great avenue had been gouged in the underbrush .
it was as though a house , launched by an avalanche , had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope .
from below no sound came , but only a distant , undefinable foetor ; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue , rather than descend and beard the unknown cyclopean horror in its lair .
three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first , but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen .
someone telephoned the news to the aylesbury transcript ; but the editor , accustomed to wild tales from dunwich , did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it ; an item soon afterwards reproduced by the associated press .
that night everyone went home , and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible .
needless to say , no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage .
about two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at elmer frye , on the eastern edge of cold spring glen , and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside .
mrs frye proposed telephoning the neighbours , and elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations .
it came , apparently , from the barn ; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle .
the dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the family .
frye lit a lantern through force of habit , but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard .
the children and the whimpered , kept from screaming by some obscure , vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence .
at last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning , and a great snapping , crashing , and crackling ensued .
the fryes , huddled together in the , did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in cold spring glen .
then , amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills in the glen , selina frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror .
the next day all the countryside was in a panic ; and cowed , uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred .
two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the frye farmyard , monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground , and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in .
of the cattle , only a quarter could be found and identified .
some of these were in curious fragments , and all that survived had to be shot .
earl sawyer suggested that help be asked from aylesbury or arkham , but others maintained it would be of no use .
old zebulon whateley , of a branch that hovered about halfway between soundness and decadence , made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the .
he came of a line where tradition ran strong , and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with wilbur and his grandfather .
darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real defence .
in a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof ; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before , and a futile , ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about .
nothing , however , occurred except some hill noises ; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come .
there were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen , though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority .
when night came again the barricading was repeated , though there was less huddling together of families .
in the morning both the frye and the seth bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar , while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting sentinel hill .
as before , the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror ; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions , as if the moving mountain had come from cold spring glen and returned to it along the same path .
at the base of the hill a swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upwards , and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail .
whatever the horror was , it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality ; and as the investigators climbed round to the hill summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended or rather , reversed there .
it was here that the whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the stone on may eve and hallowmass .
now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror , whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped .
men looked at one another and muttered .
then they looked down the hill .
apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent .
to speculate was futile .
reason , logic , and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded .
only old zebulon , who was not with the group , could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .
thursday night began much like the others , but it ended less happily .
the whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep , and about all the party telephones rang tremulously .
those who took down their receivers heard a voice shriek out , , oh , my gawd ! '
and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation .
there was nothing more .
no one dared do anything , and no one knew till morning whence the call came .
then those who had heard it called everyone on the line , and found that only the fryes did not reply .
the truth appeared an hour later , when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the frye place at the head of the glen .
it was horrible , yet hardly a surprise .
there were more swaths and monstrous prints , but there was no longer any house .
it had caved in like an , and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered .
only a stench and a tarry stickiness .
the elmer fryes had been erased from dunwich .
.
in the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a room in arkham .
the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley , delivered to miskatonic university for translation had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in language both ancient and modern ; its very alphabet , notwithstanding a general resemblance to the arabic used in mesopotamia , being absolutely unknown to any available authority .
the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet , giving the effect of a cipher ; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue , even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used .
the ancient books taken from whateley quarters , while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science , were of no assistance whatever in this matter .
one of them , a heavy tome with an iron clasp , was in another unknown alphabet this one of a very different cast , and resembling sanskrit more than anything else .
the old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of dr armitage , both because of his peculiar interest in the whateley matter , and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle ages .
armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times , and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the saracenic world .
that question , however , he did not deem vital ; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if , as he suspected , they were used as a cipher in a modern language .
it was his belief that , considering the great amount of text involved , the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own , save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations .
accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in english .
dr armitage knew , from the repeated failures of his colleagues , that the riddle was a deep and complex one ; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial .
all through late august he fortified himself with the mass lore of cryptography ; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library , and wading night after night amidst the arcana of trithemius ' poligraphia , giambattista porta de furtivis literarum notis , de vigenere traite des chiffres , falconer cryptomenysis patefacta , davys ' and thicknesse treatises , and such fairly modern authorities as blair , van marten and kluber script itself , and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms , in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table , and the message built up with arbitrary known only to the initiated .
the older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones , and armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity , no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters .
several times he seemed near daylight , only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle .
then , as september approached , the clouds began to clear .
certain letters , as used in certain parts of the manuscript , emerged definitely and unmistakably ; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in english .
on the evening of september second the last major barrier gave way , and dr armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of wilbur whateley annals .
it was in truth a diary , as all had thought ; and it was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it .
almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered , an entry dated november , , proved highly startling and disquieting .
it was written , he remembered , by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen .
today learned the aklo for the sabaoth ( it ran ) , which did not like , it being answerable from the hill and not from the air .
that upstairs more ahead of me than i had thought it would be , and is not like to have much earth brain .
shot elam hutchins collie jack when he went to bite me , and elam says he would kill me if he dast .
i guess he wo .
grandfather kept me saying the dho formula last night , and i think i saw the inner city at the magnetic poles .
i shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off , if i ca break through with the formula when i commit it .
they from the air told me at sabbat that it will be years before i can clear off the earth , and i guess grandfather will be dead then , so i shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the yr and the nhhngr .
they from outside will help , but they can not take body without human blood .
that upstairs looks it will have the right cast .
i can see it a little when i make the voorish sign or blow the powder of ibn ghazi at it , and it is near like them at may eve on the hill .
the other face may wear off some .
i wonder how i shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it .
he that came with the aklo sabaoth said i may be transfigured there being much of outside to work on .
morning found dr armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration .
he had not left the manuscript all night , but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text .
he had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home , and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful .
all that day he read on , now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary .
lunch and dinner were brought him , but he ate only the smallest fraction of either .
toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair , but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man existence that he had uncovered .
on the morning of september fourth professor rice and dr morgan insisted on seeing him for a while , and departed trembling and .
that evening he went to bed , but slept only fitfully .
wednesday the next day he was back at the manuscript , and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered .
in the small hours of that night he slept a little in a easy chair in his office , but was at the manuscript again before dawn .
some time before noon his physician , dr hartwell , called to see him and insisted that he cease work .
he refused ; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due course of time .
that evening , just as twilight fell , he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted .
his wife , bringing his dinner , found him in a state ; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken .
weakly rising , he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope , which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket .
he had sufficient strength to get home , but was so clearly in need of medical aid that dr hartwell was summoned at once .
as the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again , what , in god name , can we do ? '
dr armitage slept , but was partly delirious the next day .
he made no explanations to hartwell , but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with rice and morgan .
his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed , including frantic appeals that something in a farmhouse be destroyed , and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension .
he would shout that the world was in danger , since the elder things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen , vigintillions of aeons ago .
at other times he would call for the dreaded necronomicon and the daemonolatreia of remigius , in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up .
them , stop them ! '
he would shout .
whateleys meant to let them in , and the worst of all is left !
tell rice and morgan we must do something it a blind business , but i know how to make the powder it has been fed since the second of august , when wilbur came here to his death , and at that rate ' but armitage had a sound physique despite his years , and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever .
he woke late friday , clear of head , though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility .
saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon rice and morgan for a conference , and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate .
strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage ; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance .
of scepticism there was none .
all three had seen the body of wilbur whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building , and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman raving .
opinions were divided as to notifying the massachusetts state police , and the negative finally won .
there were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample , as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations .
late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan , but all day sunday armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory .
the more he reflected on the hellish diary , the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which wilbur whateley had left behind him the earth threatening entity which , unknown to him , was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable dunwich horror .
monday was a repetition of sunday with dr armitage , for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment .
further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan , and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain .
by tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out , and believed he would try a trip to dunwich within a week .
then , on wednesday , the great shock came .
tucked obscurely away in a corner of the arkham advertiser was a facetious little item from the associated press , telling what a monster the bootleg whisky of dunwich had raised up .
armitage , half stunned , could only telephone for rice and morgan .
far into the night they discussed , and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all .
armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers , yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him .
.
friday morning armitage , rice , and morgan set out by motor for dunwich , arriving at the village about one in the afternoon .
the day was pleasant , but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep , shadowy ravines of the stricken region .
now and then on some mountain top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky .
from the air of hushed fright at osborn store they knew something hideous had happened , and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family .
throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich , questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred , and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness , the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard , the wounded seth bishop cattle , and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places .
the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance , and he looked long at the sinister stone on the summit .
at length the visitors , apprised of a party of state police which had come from aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the frye tragedy , decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable .
this , however , they found more easily planned than performed ; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction .
there had been five of them in a car , but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the frye yard .
the natives , all of whom had talked with the policemen , seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions .
then old sam hutchins thought of something and turned pale , nudging fred farr and pointing to the dank , deep hollow that yawned close by .
, ' he gasped , ' i telled not ter go daown into the glen , an ' i never thought nobody dew it with them tracks an ' that smell an ' the whippoorwills ' daown thar in the dark o ' noonday ' a cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike , and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive , unconscious listening .
armitage , now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work , trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his .
night would soon fall , and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course .
negotium perambuians in tenebris the old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorized , and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorized .
he saw that his electric flashlight was in working order .
rice , beside him , took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects ; whilst morgan uncased the rifle on which he relied despite his colleague warnings that no material weapon would be of help .
armitage , having read the hideous diary , knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect ; but he did not add to the fright of the dunwich people by giving any hints or clues .
he hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped .
as the shadows gathered , the natives commenced to disperse homeward , anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose .
they shook their heads at the visitors ' plan to stand guard at the frye ruins near the glen ; and , as they left , had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again .
there were rumblings under the hills that night , and the whippoorwills piped threateningly .
once in a while a wind , sweeping up out of cold spring glen , would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air ; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before , when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being .
but the terror did not appear .
whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time , and armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark .
morning came wanly , and the ceased .
it was a grey , bleak day , with now and then a drizzle of rain ; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the .
the men from arkham were undecided what to do .
seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings , they debated the wisdom of waiting , or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless , monstrous quarry .
the downpour waxed in heaviness , and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons .
sheet lightning shimmered , and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand , as if descending into the accursed glen itself .
the sky grew very dark , and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short , sharp one followed by clear weather .
it was still gruesomely dark when , not much over an hour later , a confused babel of voices sounded down the road .
another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men , running , shouting , and even whimpering hysterically .
someone in the lead began sobbing out words , and the arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form .
, my gawd , my gawd , ' the voice choked out .
' agin , an ' this time by day !
it aout it aout an ' ' this very minute , an ' only the lord knows when it be on us all ! '
the speaker panted into silence , but another took up his message .
on a haour ago zeb whateley here heered the ' , an ' it was mis ' corey , george wife , that lives daown by the junction .
she says the hired boy luther was aout drivin ' in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt , when he see all the trees ' at the maouth o ' the glen opposite side ter this an ' smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las ' monday mornin ' .
an ' she says he says they was a swishin ' lappin ' saound , more nor what the bendin ' trees an ' bushes could make , an ' all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side , an ' they was a awful stompin ' an ' splashin ' in the mud .
but mind ye , luther he did see nothin ' at all , only just the bendin ' trees an ' underbrush .
fur ahead where bishop brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin ' an ' strainin ' on the bridge , an ' says he could tell the saound o ' wood ' to crack an ' split .
an ' all the whiles he never see a thing , only them trees an ' bushes ' .
an ' when the swishin ' saound got very fur off on the rud towards wizard whateley an ' sentinel hill luther he had the guts ter step up whar he heerd it fust an ' look at the graound .
it was all mud an ' water , an ' the sky was dark , an ' the rain was wipin ' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be ; but beginnin ' at the glen maouth , whar the trees hed moved , they was still some o ' them awful prints big as like he seen monday . '
at this point the first excited speaker interrupted .
that ai the trouble naow that was only the start .
zeb here was callin ' folks up an ' everybody was ' in when a call from seth bishop cut in .
his haousekeeper sally was carryin ' on fit to kill she jest seed the trees ' beside the rud , an ' says they was a kind o ' mushy saound , like a elephant puffin ' an ' treadin ' , ' fer the haouse .
then she up an ' spoke suddent of a fearful smell , an ' says her boy was ' as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the whateley rewins monday mornin ' .
an ' the dogs was barkin ' an ' whinin ' awful .
' then she let aout a turrible yell , an ' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over , only the wind strong enough to dew that .
everybody was ' , an ' we could hear lots o ' folks on the wire ' .
all to onct sally she yelled again , an ' says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up , though they no sign o ' what done it .
then everybody on the line could hear an ' old seth bishop ' tew , an ' sally was shriekin ' aout that suthin ' heavy hed struck the haouse not lightnin ' nor nothin ' , but suthin ' heavy again ' the front , that kep ' ' itself agin an ' agin , though ye could see nothin ' aout the front winders .
an ' then an ' then ' lines of fright deepened on every face ; and armitage , shaken as he was , had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker .
' then sally she yelled aout , o help , the haouse is ' in an ' on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin ' an ' a hull flock o ' screaming jes like when elmer frye place was took , only wuss ' the man paused , and another of the crowd spoke .
all not a saound nor squeak over the arter that .
jest .
we that heerd it got aout fords an ' wagons an ' rounded up as many as we could git , at corey place , an ' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew .
not but what i think it the lord jedgment fer our iniquities , that no mortal kin ever set aside . '
armitage saw that the time for positive action had come , and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics .
must follow it , boys . '
he made his voice as reassuring as possible .
' i believe there a chance of putting it out of business .
you men know that those whateleys were wizards well , this thing is a thing of wizardry , and must be put down by the same means .
i seen wilbur whateley diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read ; and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away .
of course , one ca be sure , but we can always take a chance .
it invisible i knew it would be but there powder in this sprayer that might make it show up for a second .
later on we try it .
it a frightful thing to have alive , but it is as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he lived longer .
you never know what the world escaped .
now we only this one thing to fight , and it ca multiply .
it can , though , do a lot of harm ; so we must hesitate to rid the community of it .
must follow it and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked .
let somebody lead the way i do know your roads very well , but i an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots .
how about it ? '
the men shuffled about a moment , and then earl sawyer spoke softly , pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain .
' i guess ye kin git to seth bishop quickest by cuttin ' across the lower medder here , wadin ' the brook at the low place , an ' climbin ' through carrier mowin ' an ' the beyont .
that comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh seth a leetle side . '
armitage , with rice and morgan , started to walk in the direction indicated ; and most of the natives followed slowly .
the sky was growing lighter , and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away .
when armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction , joe osborn warned him and walked ahead to show the right one .
courage and confidence were mounting , though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay towards the end of their short cut , and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder , put these qualities to a severe test .
at length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out .
they were a little beyond the seth bishop place , but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by .
only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just round the bend .
it was the frye incident all over again , and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the bishop house and barn .
no one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness , but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on towards the wrecked whateley farmhouse and the slopes of sentinel hill .
as the men passed the site of wilbur whateley abode they shuddered visibly , and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal .
it was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see , but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon .
opposite the base of sentinel hill the tracks left the road , and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster former route to and from the summit .
armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill .
then he handed the instrument to morgan , whose sight was keener .
after a moment of gazing morgan cried out sharply , passing the glass to earl sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger .
sawyer , as clumsy as most of optical devices are , fumbled a while ; but eventually focused the lenses with armitage aid .
when he did so his cry was less restrained than morgan had been .
almighty , the grass an ' bushes is ' !
it ' up creepin ' up ter the top this minute , heaven only knows what fur ! '
then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers .
it was one thing to chase the nameless entity , but quite another to find it .
spells might be all right but suppose they were ?
voices began questioning armitage about what he knew of the thing , and no reply seemed quite to satisfy .
everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind .
x .
in the end the three men from arkham old , dr armitage , stocky , professor rice , and lean , youngish dr morgan , ascended the mountain alone .
after much patient instruction regarding its focusing and use , they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road ; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed round .
it was hard going , and armitage had to be helped more than once .
high above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed with deliberateness .
then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining .
curtis whateley of the undecayed branch was holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath .
he told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending .
this , indeed , proved to be true ; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it .
then wesley corey , who had taken the glass , cried out that armitage was adjusting the sprayer which rice held , and that something must be about to happen .
the crowd stirred uneasily , recalling that his sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility .
two or three men shut their eyes , but curtis whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost .
he saw that rice , from the party point of advantage above and behind the entity , had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect .
those without the telescope saw only an instant flash of grey cloud a cloud about the size of a moderately large building near the top of the mountain .
curtis , who held the instrument , dropped it with a piercing shriek into the mud of the road .
he reeled , and would have crumbled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him .
all he could do was moan .
, oh , great gawd that that ' there was a pandemonium of questioning , and only henry wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud .
curtis was past all coherence , and even isolated replies were almost too much for him .
a barn all made o ' squirmin ' ropes hull thing sort o ' shaped like a hen egg anything with dozens o ' legs like that haff shut up when they step nothin ' solid abaout it all like jelly , an ' made o ' wrigglin ' ropes pushed clost together great bulgin ' eyes all over it ten or twenty maouths or trunks ' aout all along the sides , big as an all ' an openin ' an ' shuttin ' all grey , with kinder blue or purple rings an ' gawd it heaven that haff face on top ' this final memory , whatever it was , proved too much for poor curtis ; and he collapsed completely before he could say more .
fred farr and will hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass .
henry wheeler , trembling , turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might .
through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures , apparently running towards the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed .
only these nothing more .
then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind , and even in the underbrush of sentinel hill itself .
it was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills , and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy .
earl sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge , virtually level with the but at a considerable distance from it .
one figure , he said , seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals ; and as sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint , sound from the distance , as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures .
the weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness , but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation .
' i guess he sayin ' the spell , ' whispered wheeler as he snatched back the telescope .
the whippoorwills were piping wildly , and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .
suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud .
it was a very peculiar phenomenon , and was plainly marked by all .
a rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills , mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky .
lightning flashed aloft , and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm .
the chanting of the men from arkham now became unmistakable , and wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation .
from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .
the change in the quality of the daylight increased , and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder .
a purplish darkness , born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky blue , pressed down upon the rumbling hills .
then the lightning flashed again , somewhat brighter than before , and the crowd fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness around the on the distant height .
no one , however , had been using the telescope at that instant .
the whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation , and the men of dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged .
without warning came those deep , cracked , raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them .
not from any human throat were they born , for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions .
rather would one have said they came from the pit itself , had not their source been so unmistakably the on the peak .
it is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all , since so much of their ghastly , timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear ; yet one must do so , since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of words .
they were loud loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed yet did they come from no visible being .
and because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of beings , the huddled crowd at the mountain base huddled still closer , and winced as if in expectation of a blow .
ygnailh ygnaiih rang the hideous croaking out of space .

the speaking impulse seemed to falter here , as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on .
henry wheeler strained his eye at the telescope , but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak , all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination .
from what black wells of acherontic fear or feeling , from what unplumbed gulfs of cosmic consciousness or obscure , heredity , were those drawn ?
presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark , utter , ultimate frenzy .
!
! ff ff ff !
!
!
but that was all .
the pallid group in the road , still reeling at the indisputably english syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking , were never to hear such syllables again .
instead , they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills ; the deafening , cataclysmic peal whose source , be it inner earth or sky , no hearer was ever able to place .
a single lightning bolt shot from the purple zenith to the , and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside .
trees , grass , and were whipped into a fury ; and the frightened crowd at the mountain base , weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them , were almost hurled off their feet .
dogs howled from the distance , green grass and foliage wilted to a curious , sickly , and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills .
the stench left quickly , but the vegetation never came right again .
to this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted .
they were grave and quiet , and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering .
in reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact .
thing has gone for ever , ' armitage said .
has been split up into what it was originally made of , and can never exist again .
it was an impossibility in a normal world .
only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know .
it was like its father and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe ; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills . '
there was a brief silence , and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity ; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan .
memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off , and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again .
, oh , my gawd , that haff face that haff face on top of it that face with the red eyes an ' crinkly albino hair , an ' no chin , like the whateleys it was a octopus , centipede , spider kind o ' thing , but they was a man face on top of it , an ' it looked like wizard whateley , only it was yards an ' yards acrost ' he paused exhausted , as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror .
only old zebulon whateley , who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore , spoke aloud .
year ' gone , ' he rambled , ' i heered ol ' whateley say as haow some day we hear a child o ' lavinny ' its father name on the top o ' sentinel hill ' but joe osborn interrupted him to question the arkham men anew .
was it , anyhaow , an ' haowever did young wizard whateley call it aout o ' the air it come from ? '
armitage chose his words very carefully .
was well , it was mostly a kind of force that does belong in our part of space ; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature .
we have no business calling in such things from outside , and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to .
there was some of it in wilbur whateley himself enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him , and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight .
i going to burn his accursed diary , and if you men are wise you dynamite that up there , and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills .
things like that brought down the beings those whateleys were so fond of the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose .
as to this thing we just sent back the whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come .
it grew fast and big from the same reason that wilbur grew fast and big but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it .
you need ask how wilbur called it out of the air .
he did call it out .
it was his twin brother , but it looked more like the father than he did . '
i bear in mind closely that i did not see any actual visual horror at the end .
to say that a mental shock was the cause of what i inferred that last straw which sent me racing out of the lonely akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of vermont in a commandeered motor at night is to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience .
notwithstanding the deep things i saw and heard , and the admitted vividness the impression produced on me by these things , i can not prove even now whether i was right or wrong in my hideous inference .
for after all akeley disappearance establishes nothing .
people found nothing amiss in his house despite the on the outside and inside .
it was just as though he had walked out casually for a ramble in the hills and failed to return .
there was not even a sign that a guest had been there , or that those horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study .
that he had mortally feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had been born and reared , means nothing at all , either ; for thousands are subject to just such morbid fears .
eccentricity , moreover , could easily account for his strange acts and apprehensions toward the last .
the whole matter began , so far as i am concerned , with the historic and unprecedented vermont floods of november , .
i was then , as now , an instructor of literature at miskatonic university in arkham , massachusetts , and an enthusiastic amateur student of new england folklore .
shortly after the flood , amidst the varied reports of hardship , suffering , and organized relief which filled the press , there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in some of the swollen rivers ; so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions and appealed to me to shed what light i could on the subject .
i felt flattered at having my folklore study taken so seriously , and did what i could to belittle the wild , vague tales which seemed so clearly an outgrowth of old rustic superstitions .
it amused me to find several persons of education who insisted that some stratum of obscure , distorted fact might underlie the rumors .
the tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings ; though one yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a letter from his mother in hardwick , vermont .
the type of thing described was essentially the same in all cases , though there seemed to be three separate instances involved one connected with the winooski river near montpelier , another attached to the west river in windham county beyond newfane , and a third centering in the passumpsic in caledonia county above lyndonville .
of course many of the stray items mentioned other instances , but on analysis they all seemed to boil down to these three .
in each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre and disturbing objects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills , and there was a widespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive , cycle of whispered legend which old people resurrected for the occasion .
what people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had ever seen before .
naturally , there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic period ; but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were not human , despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline .
nor , said the witnesses , could they have been any kind of animal known to vermont .
they were pinkish things about five feet long ; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membranous wings and several sets of articulated limbs , and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid , covered with multitudes of very short antennae , where a head would ordinarily be .
it was really remarkable how closely the reports from different sources tended to coincide ; though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old legends , shared at one time throughout the hill country , furnished a morbidly vivid picture which might well have coloured the imaginations of all the witnesses concerned .
it was my conclusion that such witnesses in every case naive and simple backwoods folk had glimpsed the battered and bloated bodies of human beings or farm animals in the whirling currents ; and had allowed the folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantastic attributes .
the ancient folklore , while cloudy , evasive , and largely forgotten by the present generation , was of a highly singular character , and obviously reflected the influence of still earlier indian tales .
i knew it well , though i had never been in vermont , through the exceedingly rare monograph of eli davenport , which embraces material orally obtained prior to among the oldest people of the state .
this material , moreover , closely coincided with tales which i had personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of new hampshire .
briefly summarized , it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked somewhere among the remoter hills in the deep woods of the highest peaks , and the dark valleys where streams trickle from unknown sources .
these beings were seldom glimpsed , but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certain deep , gorges that even the wolves shunned .
there were queer footprints or in the mud of and barren patches , and curious circles of stones , with the grass around them worn away , which did not seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by nature .
there were , too , certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the hills ; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental , and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and away from them if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated .
and worst of all , there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal .
it would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had not agreed so well .
as it was , nearly all the rumors had several points in common ; averring that the creatures were a sort of huge , crab with many pairs of legs and with two great batlike wings in the middle of the back .
they sometimes walked on all their legs , and sometimes on the hindmost pair only , using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature .
on one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers , a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation .
once a specimen was seen flying launching itself from the top of a bald , lonely hill at night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant against the full moon these things seemed content , on the whole , to let mankind alone ; though they were at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals especially persons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains .
many localities came to be known as inadvisable to settle in , the feeling persisting long after the cause was forgotten .
people would look up at some of the neighbouring with a shudder , even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost , and how many farmhouses burnt to ashes , on the lower slopes of those grim , green sentinels .
but while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy ; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men , and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world .
there were tales of the queer seen around farmhouse windows in the morning , and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas .
tales , besides , of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travelers on roads and in the deep woods , and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their .
in the final layer of legends the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change , and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings .
in one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things .
as to what the things were explanations naturally varied .
the common name applied to them was those ones , or the old ones , though other terms had a local and transient use .
perhaps the bulk of the puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil , and made them a basis of awed theological speculation .
those with celtic legendry in their heritage mainly the element of new hampshire , and their kindred who had settled in vermont on governor wentworth colonial grants linked them vaguely with the malign fairies and little people of the bogs and raths , and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations .
but the indians had the most fantastic theories of all .
while different tribal legends differed , there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars ; it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earth .
the pennacook myths , which were the most consistent and picturesque , taught that the winged ones came from the great bear in the sky , and had mines in our earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world .
they did not live here , said the myths , but merely maintained outposts and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north .
they harmed only those who got too near them or spied upon them .
animals shunned them through instinctive hatred , not because of being hunted .
they could not eat the things and animals of earth , but brought their own food from the stars .
it was bad to get near them , and sometimes young hunters who went into their hills never came back .
it was not good , either , to listen to what they whispered at night in the forest with voices like a bee that tried to be like the voices of men .
they knew the speech of all kinds of men pennacooks , hurons , men of the five nations but did not seem to have or need any speech of their own .
they talked with their heads , which changed colour in different ways to mean different things .
all the legendry , of course , white and indian alike , died down during the nineteenth century , except for occasional atavistical flareups .
the ways of the vermonters became settled ; and once their habitual paths and dwellings were established according to a certain fixed plan , they remembered less and less what fears and avoidances had determined that plan , and even that there had been any fears or avoidances .
most people simply knew that certain hilly regions were considered as highly unhealthy , unprofitable , and generally unlucky to live in , and that the farther one kept from them the better off one usually was .
in time the ruts of custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in approved places that there was no longer any reason for going outside them , and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design .
save during infrequent local scares , only grandmothers and retrospective nonagenarians ever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills ; and even such whispers admitted that there was not much to fear from those things now that they were used to the presence of houses and settlements , and now that human beings let their chosen territory severely alone .
all this i had long known from my reading , and from certain folk tales picked up in new hampshire ; hence when the rumours began to appear , i could easily guess what imaginative background had evolved them .
i took great pains to explain this to my friends , and was correspondingly amused when several contentious souls continued to insist on a possible element of truth in the reports .
such persons tried to point out that the early legends had a significant persistence and uniformity , and that the virtually unexplored nature of the vermont hills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not dwell among them ; nor could they be silenced by my assurance that all the myths were of a pattern common to most of mankind and determined by early phases of imaginative experience which always produced the same type of delusion .
it was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the vermont myths differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs , suggested the kallikanzarai of modern greece , and gave to wild wales and ireland their dark hints of strange , small , and terrible hidden races of troglodytes and burrowers .
no use , either , to point out the even more startlingly similar belief of the nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded or abominable who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the himalayan summits .
when i brought up this evidence , my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales ; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder , driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind , which might very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times or even to the present .
the more i laughed at such theories , the more these stubborn friends asseverated them ; adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were too clear , consistent , detailed , and sanely prosaic in manner of telling , to be completely ignored .
two or three fanatical extremists went so far as to hint at possible meanings in the ancient indian tales which gave the hidden beings a nonterrestrial origin ; citing the extravagant books of charles fort with their claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited the earth .
most of my foes , however , were merely romanticists who insisted on trying to transfer to real life the fantastic lore of lurking little people made popular by the magnificent of arthur machen .
as was only natural under the circumstances , this piquant debating finally got into print in the form of letters to the arkham advertiser ; some of which were copied in the press of those vermont regions whence the came .
the rutland herald gave half a page of extracts from the letters on both sides , while the brattleboro reformer reprinted one of my long historical and mythological summaries in full , with some accompanying comments in the pendrifter thoughtful column which supported and applauded my skeptical conclusions .
by the spring of i was almost a figure in vermont , notwithstanding the fact that i had never set foot in the state .
then came the challenging letters from henry akeley which impressed me so profoundly , and which took me for the first and last time to that fascinating realm of crowded green precipices and muttering forest streams .
most of what i know of henry wentworth akeley was gathered by correspondence with his neighbours , and with his only son in california , after my experience in his lonely farmhouse .
he was , i discovered , the last representative on his home soil of a long , locally distinguished line of jurists , administrators , and .
in him , however , the family mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship ; so that he had been a notable student of mathematics , astronomy , biology , anthropology , and folklore at the university of vermont .
i had never previously heard of him , and he did not give many autobiographical details in his communications ; but from the first i saw he was a man of character , education , and intelligence , albeit a recluse with very little worldly sophistication .
despite the incredible nature of what he claimed , i could not help at once taking akeley more seriously than i had taken any of the other challengers of my views .
for one thing , he was really close to the actual phenomena visible and tangible that he speculated so grotesquely about ; and for another thing , he was amazingly willing to leave his conclusions in a tentative state like a true man of science .
he had no personal preferences to advance , and was always guided by what he took to be solid evidence .
of course i began by considering him mistaken , but gave him credit for being intelligently mistaken ; and at no time did i emulate some of his friends in attributing his ideas , and his fear of the lonely green hills , to insanity .
i could see that there was a great deal to the man , and knew that what he reported must surely come from strange circumstance deserving investigation , however little it might have to do with the fantastic causes he assigned .
later on i received from him certain material proofs which placed the matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basis .
i can not do better than transcribe in full , so far as is possible , the long letter in which akeley introduced himself , and which formed such an important landmark in my own intellectual history .
it is no longer in my possession , but my memory holds almost every word of its portentous message ; and again i affirm my confidence in the sanity of the man who wrote it .
here is the text a text which reached me in the cramped , scrawl of one who had obviously not mingled much with the world during his sedate , scholarly life .
.
, townshend , windham , vermont .
may albert wilmarth , , saltonstall , arkham , mass .
my dear sir i have read with great interest the brattleboro reformer reprint ( apr .
, ) of your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded streams last fall , and on the curious folklore they so well agree with .
it is easy to see why an outlander would take the position you take , and even why pendrifter agrees with you .
that is the attitude generally taken by educated persons both in and out of vermont , and was my own attitude as a young man ( i am now ) before my studies , both general and in davenport book , led me to do some exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visited .
i was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales i used to hear from elderly farmers of the more ignorant sort , but now i wish i had let the whole matter alone .
i might say , with all proper modesty , that the subject of anthropology and folklore is by no means strange to me .
i took a good deal of it at college , and am familiar with most of the standard authorities such as tylor , lubbock , frazer , quatrefages , murray , osborn , keith , boule , elliott smith , and so on .
it is no news to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind .
i have seen the reprints of letters from you , and those agreeing with you , in the rutland herald , and guess i know about where your controversy stands at the present time .
what i desire to say now is , that i am afraid your adversaries are nearer right than yourself , even though all reason seems to be on your side .
they are nearer right than they realise themselves for of course they go only by theory , and can not know what i know .
if i knew as little of the matter as they , i would feel justified in believing as they do .
i would be wholly on your side .
you can see that i am having a hard time getting to the point , probably because i really dread getting to the point ; but the upshot of the matter is that i have certain evidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high hills which nobody visits .
i have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers , as reported , but i have seen things like them under circumstances i dread to repeat .
i have seen footprints , and of late have seen them nearer my own home ( i live in the old akeley place south of townshend village , on the side of dark mountain ) than i dare tell you now .
and i have overheard voices in the woods at certain points that i will not even begin to describe on paper .
at one place i heard them so much that i took a phonograph therewith a dictaphone attachment and wax blank and i shall try to arrange to have you hear the record i got .
i have run it on the machine for some of the old people up here , and one of the voices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its likeness to a certain voice ( that buzzing voice in the woods which davenport mentions ) that their grandmothers have told about and mimicked for them .
i know what most people think of a man who tells about hearing voices but before you draw conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older backwoods people what they think of it .
if you can account for it normally , very well ; but there must be something behind it .
ex nihilo nihil fit , you know .
now my object in writing you is not to start an argument but to give you information which i think a man of your tastes will find deeply interesting .
this is private .
publicly i am on your side , for certain things show me that it does not do for people to know too much about these matters .
my own studies are now wholly private , and i would not think of saying anything to attract people attention and cause them to visit the places i have explored .
it is true terribly true that there are creatures watching us all the time ; with spies among us gathering information .
it is from a wretched man who , if he was sane ( as i think he was ) was one of those spies , that i got a large part of my clues to the matter .
he later killed himself , but i have reason to think there are others now .
the things come from another planet , being able to live in interstellar space and fly through it on clumsy , powerful wings which have a way of resisting the aether but which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them about on earth .
i will tell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as a madman .
they come here to get metals from mines that go deep under the hills , and i think i know where they come from .
they will not hurt us if we let them alone , but no one can say what will happen if we get too curious about them .
of course a good army of men could wipe out their mining colony .
that is what they are afraid of .
but if that happened , more would come from outside any number of them .
they could easily conquer the earth , but have not tried so far because they have not needed to .
they would rather leave things as they are to save bother .
i think they mean to get rid of me because of what i have discovered .
there is a great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which i found in the woods on round hill , east of here ; and after i took it home everything became different .
if they think i suspect too much they will either kill me or take me off the earth to where they come from .
they like to take away men of learning once in a while , to keep informed on the state of things in the human world .
this leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing you namely , to urge you to hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicity .
people must be kept away from these hills , and in order to effect this , their curiosity ought not to be aroused any further .
heaven knows there is peril enough anyway , with promoters and real estate men flooding vermont with herds of summer people to overrun the wild places and cover the hills with cheap bungalows .
i shall welcome further communication with you , and shall try to send you that phonograph record and black stone ( which is so worn that photographs do show much ) by express if you are willing .
i say try because i think those creatures have a way of tampering with things around here .
there is a sullen furtive fellow named brown , on a farm near the village , who i think is their spy .
little by little they are trying to cut me off from our world because i know too much about their world .
they have the most amazing way of finding out what i do .
you may not even get this letter .
i think i shall have to leave this part of the country and go live with my son in san diego , , if things get any worse , but it is not easy to give up the place you were born in , and where your family has lived for six generations .
also , i would hardly dare sell this house to anybody now that the creatures have taken notice of it .
they seem to be trying to get the black stone back and destroy the phonograph record , but i shall not let them if i can help it .
my great police dogs always hold them back , for there are very few here as yet , and they are clumsy in getting about .
as i have said , their wings are not much use for short flights on earth .
i am on the very brink of deciphering that stone in a very terrible way and with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply the missing links enough to help me .
i suppose you know all about the fearful myths antedating the coming of man to the earth the and cthulhu cycles which are hinted at in the necronomicon .
i had access to a copy of that once , and hear that you have one in your college library under lock and key .
to conclude , wilmarth , i think that with our respective studies we can be very useful to each other .
i do wish to put you in any peril , and suppose i ought to warn you that possession of the stone and the record wo be very safe ; but i think you will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge .
i will drive down to newfane or brattleboro to send whatever you authorize me to send , for the express offices there are more to be trusted .
i might say that i live quite alone now , since i ca keep hired help any more .
they wo stay because of the things that try to get near the house at night , and that keep the dogs barking continually .
i am glad i did get as deep as this into the business while my wife was alive , for it would have driven her mad .
hoping that i am not bothering you unduly , and that you will decide to get in touch with me rather than throw this letter into the waste basket as a madman raving , i am yrs .
very truly , henry akeley .
i am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me , which i think will help to prove a number of the points i have touched on .
the old people think they are monstrously true .
i shall send you these very soon if you are interested .
a .
it would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange document for the first time .
by all ordinary rules , i ought to have laughed more loudly at these extravagances than at the far milder theories which had previously moved me to mirth ; yet something in the tone of the letter made me take it with paradoxical seriousness .
not that i believed for a moment in the hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of ; but that , after some grave preliminary doubts , i grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity , and of his confrontation by some genuine though singular and abnormal phenomenon which he could not explain except in this imaginative way .
it could not be as he thought it , i reflected , yet on the other hand , it could not be otherwise than worthy of investigation .
the man seemed unduly excited and alarmed about something , but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking .
he was so specific and logical in certain ways and after all , his yarn did fit in so perplexingly well with some of the old myths even the wildest indian legends .
that he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills , and had really found the black stone he spoke about , was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he had made inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outer beings and had later killed himself .
it was easy to deduce that this man must have been wholly insane , but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive akeley already prepared for such things by his folklore studies believe his tale .
as for the latest developments it appeared from his inability to keep hired help that akeley humbler rustic neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at night .
the dogs really barked , too .
and then the matter of that phonograph record , which i could not but believe he had obtained in the way he said .
it must mean something ; whether animal noises deceptively like human speech , or the speech of some hidden , human being decayed to a state not much above that of lower animals .
from this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed stone , and to speculations upon what it might mean .
then , too , what of the photographs which akeley said he was about to send , and which the old people had found so convincingly terrible ?
as i the cramped handwriting i felt as never before that my credulous opponents might have more on their side than i had conceded .
after all , there might be some queer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills , even though no such race of monsters as folklore claimed .
and if there were , then the presence of strange bodies in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief .
was it too presumptuous to suppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind them ?
but even as i harboured these doubts i felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of bizarrerie as henry akeley wild letter had brought them up .
in the end i answered akeley letter , adopting a tone of friendly interest and soliciting further particulars .
his reply came almost by return mail ; and contained , true to promise , a number of kodak views of scenes and objects illustrating what he had to tell .
glancing at these pictures as i took them from the envelope , i felt a curious sense of fright and nearness to forbidden things ; for in spite of the vagueness of most of them , they had a damnably suggestive power which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographs actual optical links with what they portrayed , and the product of an impersonal transmitting process without prejudice , fallibility , or mendacity .
the more i looked at them , the more i saw that my serious estimate of akeley and his story had not been unjustified .
certainly , these pictures carried conclusive evidence of something in the vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our common knowledge and belief .
the worst thing of all was the footprint a view taken where the sun shone on a mud patch somewhere in a deserted upland .
