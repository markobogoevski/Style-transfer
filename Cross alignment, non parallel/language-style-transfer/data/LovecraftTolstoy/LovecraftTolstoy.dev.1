this prisoner , who was nicknamed miss dandy , because of her stylishness , was under indictment for theft and incendiarism .
behind them , in a very dirty , gray shirt , stood a woman , big with child , who was charged with concealing stolen property .
this woman was silent , but she approvingly smiled at the actions of the prisoners without .
the fourth of the women who stood at the window , and was undergoing sentence for illicit trading in spirits , was a squat little country woman with bulging eyes and kindly face .
she was the mother of the boy who was playing with the old woman , and of another girl , both of whom were in jail with her , because they had no one else to take care of them .
knitting a stocking , she was looking through the window and disapprovingly frowned and closed her eyes at the language used by the passing prisoners .
the girl who stood near the woman , with only a shirt on her back , and clinging with one hand to the skirt , attentively listened to the abusive words the men were exchanging with the women , and repeated them in a whisper , as if committing them to memory .
the twelfth was the daughter of a church clerk and chanter who had drowned her child in a well .
she was a tall and stately girl , with large eyes and tangled hair sticking out of her short , thick , flaxen braid .
she paid no attention to what was going on around her , but paced , , and in a dirty gray shirt , over the floor of the cell , making sharp and quick turns when she reached the wall .
when with a rattling of chains the cell door was unlocked and maslova admitted , all eyes were turned toward her .
even the chanter daughter stopped for a moment and looked at her with raised eyebrows , but immediately resumed walking with long , resolute strides .
korableva stuck her needle into the sack she was sewing and gazed inquiringly through her glasses at maslova .
ah me !
so she has returned , she said in a hoarse basso voice .
and i was sure she would be set right .
she must have got it .
she removed her glasses and placed them with her sewing beside her .
i have been talking with auntie , dear , and we thought that they might discharge you at once .
they say it happens .
and they sometimes give you money , if you strike the right time , the started in a singing voice .
what !
it seems we were wrong .
god has his own way , dear , she went on in her caressing and melodious voice .
it is possible that they convicted you ?
asked theodosia , with gentle compassion , looking at maslova with her childish , eyes , and her cheerful , young face changed , and she seemed to be ready to cry .
maslova made no answer , but silently went to her place , next to korableva , and sat down .
you have probably not eaten anything , said theodosia , rising and going over to maslova .
again maslova did not answer , but placed the two at the head of the cot and began to undress .
she took off the dusty coat , and the from her curling black hair and sat down .
the old woman also came and stopped in front of maslova , compassionately shaking her head .
the boy came behind the old woman , and , with a protruding corner of the upper lip and eyes , gazed on the rolls brought by maslova .
seeing all these compassionate faces , after what had happened , maslova almost cried and her lips began to twitch .
she tried to and did restrain herself until the old woman and the child approached .
when , however , she heard the kind , compassionate exclamation of pity from the old woman , and , especially , when her eyes met the serious eyes of the boy who looked now at her , now at the rolls , she could restrain herself no longer .
her whole face began to twitch and she burst into sobs .
i told her to take a good lawyer , said korableva .
well ?
to siberia ?
she asked .
maslova wished to answer but could not , and , crying , she produced from the roll the box of cigarettes , on which a picture of a red lady with a high chignon and , low cut neck was printed , and gave it to korableva .
the latter looked at the picture , disapprovingly shook her head , chiefly because maslova spent money so foolishly , and , lighting a cigarette over the lamp , inhaled the smoke several times , then thrust it at maslova .
maslova , without ceasing to cry , eagerly began to inhale the smoke .
penal servitude , she murmured , sobbing .
they have no fear of god , these cursed !
said korableva .
they have condemned an innocent girl .
at this moment there was a loud outburst of laughter among those standing near the window .
the delicate laughter of the little girl mingled with the hoarse and shrill laughter of the women .
this merriment was caused by some act of a prisoner without .
oh , the scoundrel !
see what he is doing !
said the woman , pressing her face against the grating , her whole massive frame shaking .
what is that shouting about ?
said korableva , shaking her head at the woman , and then again turning to maslova .
how many years ?
four , said maslova , and the flow of her tears was so copious that one of them fell on the cigarette .
she angrily crushed it , threw it away and took another .
the , although she was no smoker , immediately picked up the and began to straighten it , talking at the same time .
as i said to matveievna , dear , she said , it is .
they do what they please .
and we thought they would discharge you .
matveievna said you would be discharged , and i said that you would not , i said .
heart tells me , ' i said , they will condemn her , ' and so it happened , she went on , evidently listening to the sounds of her own voice with particular pleasure .
the prisoners had now passed through the , and the four women left the window and approached maslova .
the illicit seller of spirits was the first to speak .
well , is the sentence very severe ?
she asked , seating herself near maslova and continuing to knit her stocking .
it is severe because she has no money .
if she had money to hire a good lawyer , i am sure they would not have held her , said korableva .
that lawyer what his name ? that clumsy , one can , my dear madam , lead one out of the water dry .
that the man you should take .
to hire him !
grinned miss dandy .
why , he would not look at you for less than a thousand rubles .
it seems to be your fate , said the old woman who was charged with incendiarism .
i should say he is severe !
he drove my boy wife from her ; put him in jail , and me , too , in my old age , for the hundredth time she began to repeat her story .
prison and poverty are our lot .
if it is not prison , it is poverty .
yes , it is always the same with them , said the , and , closely inspecting the girl head , she put her stocking aside , drew the girl over between her overhanging legs and with dexterous fingers began to search in her head .
why do you deal in wine ?
but i have to feed my children , she said , continuing her search .
these words reminded maslova of wine .
oh , for a drop of wine , she said to korableva , wiping her tears with the sleeve of her shirt and sobbing from time to time .
some booze ?
why , of course !
said korableva .
maslova produced the money from one of the and gave it to korableva , who climbed up to the of the oven for a flask of wine she had hidden there .
seeing which , those women who were not her immediate neighbors went to their places .
meantime maslova shook the dust from her and coat , climbed up on her cot and began to eat a roll .
i saved some tea for you , but i fear it is cold , said theodosia , bringing down from a shelf a pot , wrapped in a rag , and a tin cup .
the beverage was perfectly cold , and tasted more of tin than of tea , but maslova poured out a cupful and began to drink .
here , finashka !
she called , and breaking a piece from the roll thrust it toward the boy , who gazed at her .
korableva , meanwhile , brought the flask of wine .
maslova offered some to korableva and miss dandy .
these three prisoners constituted the aristocracy of the cell , because they had money and divided among themselves what they had .
in a few minutes maslova became brighter and energetically began to relate what had transpired at the court , mockingly imitating the prosecutor and rehearsing such parts as had appealed to her most .
she was particularly impressed by the fact that the men paid considerable attention to her wherever she went .
in the every one looked at her , she said , and for that purpose constantly came into the prisoners ' room .
even the guard said is to look at you that they come here . '
some one would come and ask for some document or something , but i saw that it was not for the document that he came .
he would devour me with his eyes , she said , smiling and shaking her head as if perplexed .
they are good ones !
yes , that is how it is , chimed in the in her melodious voice .
they are like flies on sugar .
if you needed them for any other purpose , be sure they would not come so quickly .
they know a good thing when they see it .
it was the same here , interrupted maslova .
as soon as i was brought here i met with a party coming from the depot .
they gave me no rest , and i could hardly get rid of them .
luckily the warden drove them off .
one of them bothered me particularly .
how did he look ?
asked miss dandy .
he had a dark complexion , and wore a mustache .
it is he .
who ?
stchegloff .
he passed here just now .
who is stchegloff ?
she do know stchegloff !
he twice escaped from siberia .
now he has been caught , but he will escape again .
even the officers fear him , said miss dandy , who delivered notes to prisoners , and knew everything that transpired in the jail .
he will surely escape .
if he does he wo take either of us with him , said korableva .
you better tell me this what did the lawyer say to you about a petition you must send one now .
maslova said that she did not know anything about a petition .
at this moment the woman , burying her two freckled hands into her tangled , thick hair , and scratching her head with her nails , approached the aristocrats .
i will tell you , katherine , everything , she began .
first of all , you must write on paper ' i am not satisfied with the trial , ' and then hand it to the prosecutor .
what do you want here ?
korableva turned to her , speaking in an angry basso .
you have smelled the wine !
we know you .
we do need your advice ; we know what we have to do .
who is talking to you ?
you want some wine that what you want .
let her alone .
give her some , said maslova , who always divided with others what she had .
yes , i will give her , and korableva clenched her fist .
try it !
try it !
moving toward korableva , said the woman .
i am not afraid of you .
you jail bird !
you are another !
you gutter rake !
i am a rake am i ?
you convict , murderess !
shrieked the woman .
go away , i tell you !
said korableva frowning .
but the woman only came nearer , and korableva gave her a push on the open , fat breast .
the other seemingly only waited for this , for with an unexpected , quick movement of one hand she seized korableva hair and was about to strike her in the face with the other , when korableva seized this hand .
maslova and miss dandy sprang up and took hold of the hands of the woman , endeavoring to release her hold on korableva , but the hand that clutched the hair would not open .
for a moment she released the hair , but only to wind it around her fist .
korableva , her head bent , with one hand kept striking her antagonist over the body and catching the latter hand with her teeth .
the women crowded around the fighters , parting them and shouting .
even the consumptive came near them , and , coughing , looked on .
the children huddled together and cried .
the noise attracted the warden and the matron .
they were finally parted .
korableva loosened her gray braid and began to pick out the pieces of torn hair , while the other held the tattered remnant of her shirt to her breast both shouting , explaining and complaining against one another .
i know it is the wine i can smell it , said the matron .
i will tell the superintendent .
now , remove everything , or there will be trouble .
there is no time to listen to you .
to your places , and be silent !
but for a long time there was no silence .
the women continued to curse each other ; they began to relate how it all commenced , and whose fault it was .
the warden and matron finally departed ; the women quieted down and took to their cots .
the old woman stood up before the image and began to pray .
two siberian convicts , suddenly said the woman in a hoarse voice , accompanying every word with a torrent of abuse .
look out , or you will get it again , quickly answered korableva , adding similar revilement .
then they became silent .
if they had not prevented me , i should have knocked out your eyes , the one began again , and again came a quick and sharp retort .
then came another interval of silence , followed by more abuse .
the intervals became longer and longer , and finally silence settled over the cell .
they were all falling asleep ; some began to snore ; only the old woman , who always prayed for a long time , was still bowing before the image , while the chanter daughter , as soon as the matron left the cell , came down from her cot and began to walk up and down the cell .
maslova was awake and incessantly thinking of herself as a convict , the word which had been twice applied to her once by bochkova , and again by the woman .
she could not be reconciled to the thought .
korableva , who was lying with her back turned toward maslova , turned around .
i never dreamed of such a thing , she said , in a low voice .
others commit heaven knows what crimes , and they go scot free , while i must suffer for nothing .
do worry , girl .
people live also in siberia .
you will not be lost even there , korableva consoled her .
i know that i will not be lost , but it is painful to be treated that way .
i deserved a better fate .
i am used to a comfortable life .
you can do nothing against god will , korableva said , with a sigh .
you can do nothing against his will .
i know , auntie , but it is hard , nevertheless .
they became silent .
listen to that wanton , said korableva , calling maslova attention to the strange sounds that came from the other end of the cell .
these sounds were the suppressed sobbing of the woman .
she wept because she had just been abused , beaten , and got no wine , for which she so yearned .
she also wept because her whole life was one round of abuse , scorn , insults and blows .
she meant to draw some consolation from the recollection of her first love for the factory hand , fedka molodenkoff , but , recalling this first love , she also recalled the manner of its ending .
the end of it was that this molodenkoff , while in his cups , by way of jest , smeared her face with vitriol , and afterward laughed with his comrades as he watched her writhing in pain .
she remembered this , and she pitied herself ; and , thinking that no one heard her , she began to weep , and wept like a child moaning , snuffling and swallowing salty tears .
nekhludoff rose the following morning with a consciousness that some change had taken place within him , and before he could recall what it was he already knew that it was good and important .
katiousha the trial .
yes , and i must stop lying , and tell all the truth .
and what a remarkable coincidence !
that very morning finally came the letter of maria vasilievna , the wife of the marshal of the nobility that same letter that he wanted so badly now .
she gave him his liberty and wished him happiness in his proposed marriage .
marriage !
he repeated ironically .
how far i am from it !
and his determination of the day before to tell everything to her husband , to confess his sin before him , and to hold himself ready for any satisfaction he might demand , came to his mind .
but this morning it did not seem to him so easy as it had yesterday .
and then , what is the good of making a man miserable ?
if he asks me , i will tell him ; but to call on him specially for that purpose no , it is not necessary .
it seemed to him equally difficult this morning to tell all the truth to missy .
he thought it would be offering an insult .
it was inevitable , as in all worldly affairs , that there should remain something unexpressed but understood .
one thing , however , he decided upon this morning that he would not go there , and would tell the truth when asked .
but in his relations toward katiousha there was to be nothing unsaid .
i will go to the jail will tell her , beg of her to forgive me .
and , if necessary yes , if necessary i will marry her , he thought .
the idea that for the sake of moral satisfaction he would sacrifice everything and marry her this morning particularly affected him .
it was a long time since he had risen with so much energy in him .
when agrippina petrovna entered his room he declared to her with a determination which he himself did not expect , that he had no further need of the house , and that he would dispense with her services .
there was a tacit understanding that the large house was kept up for his contemplated marriage .
the closing up of the house consequently had some particular significance .
agrippina petrovna looked at him with surprise .
i thank you very much , agrippina petrovna , for your solicitude in my behalf , but i do not now need such a large house , or any of the servants .
if you wish to help me , then be so kind as to pack away the things as you used to do in mamma lifetime .
natasha will dispose of them when she arrives .
natasha was nekhludoff sister .
agrippina petrovna shook her head .
dispose of them ?
why , they will be needed , she said .
no , they will not , agrippina petrovna they will positively not be needed , said nekhludoff , answering what she meant by shaking his head .
please tell kornei that his salary will be paid for two months in advance , but that i do not need him .
you are wrong in doing this , dmitri ivanovich , she said .
you will need a house even if you go abroad .
you misunderstand me , agrippina petrovna .
i will not go abroad , and if i do go , it will be to an entirely different place .
his face suddenly turned a purple color .
yes , it is necessary to tell her , he thought .
i must tell all to everybody .
a very strange and important thing has happened to me .
do you remember katiousha , who lived with aunt maria ivanovna ?
of course ; i taught her to sew .
well , then , she was tried in court yesterday , and i was one of the jury .
ah , good lord !
what a pity !
said agrippina petrovna .
what was she tried for ?
murder , and it was all caused by me .
how could you have caused it ?
you are talking very strangely , said agrippina petrovna , and fire sparkled in her old eyes .
she knew of the incident with katiousha .
yes , it is my fault .
and this causes me to change my plans .
what change can this cause in your plans ?
said agrippina petrovna , suppressing a smile .
this that since it was through my fault that she is in her present condition , i consider it my duty to help her to the extent of my ability .
that is your affair , but i can not see that you are so much in fault .
it happens to everybody , and if one is guided by common sense the matter is usually arranged and forgotten , and one lives on like the rest of the world , said agrippina petrovna , sternly and seriously .
there is no reason why you should take it so much to heart .
i heard long ago that she had gone to the bad , so whose fault is it ?
it is my fault , and that is why i wish to make amends .
well , it is hard to set that right .
that is my affair .
if you are thinking of yourself , then that which mother wished i am not thinking of myself .
your deceased mother showed me so many favors that i do not desire anything .
my niece , lizauka , wishes me to come to her , so i will go as soon as you need me no longer .
only you are taking it too much to heart ; it happens with everybody .
well , i do not think so .
i still ask you to help me rent the house and pack away the things .
and do not be angry with me .
i am very , very thankful to you for everything .
it is remarkable that since nekhludoff understood that he was disgusted with himself , others ceased to be repulsive to him .
on the contrary , he had a kindly and respectful feeling for agrippina petrovna and kornei .
he wished to confess also before kornei , but the latter was so impressively respectful that he could not make up his mind to do it .
on his way to the court , passing along the familiar streets and in the same carriage , nekhludoff was himself surprised what a different man he felt himself .
his marriage to missy , which but yesterday seemed to be so near , appeared to him absolutely impossible .
yesterday he understood his position to be such that there could be no doubt that she would be happy to marry him ; he felt himself unworthy not only of marrying her , but of being her friend .
if she only knew who i was , she would never receive me , and yet i taunted her with coquetting with that gentleman .
but no , even if she married me i should never have peace , even though i were happy , while that one is in jail , and may any day be sent under escort to siberia .
while the woman whom i have ruined is tramping the weary road to penal servitude , i will be receiving congratulations , and paying visits with my young wife .
or i will be counting the votes for and against school inspection , , with the marshal , whom i have shamefully deceived , and afterward make appointments with his wife ( what abomination ! ) .
or i will work on my picture , which will , evidently , never be finished , for i had no business to occupy myself with such trifles .
and i can do neither of these things now , he said to himself , happy at the inward change which he felt .
first of all , he thought , i must see the lawyer , and then then see her in jail the convict of yesterday and tell her everything .
and when he thought how he would see her , confess his guilt before her , how he would declare to her that he would do everything in his power , marry her in order to wipe out his guilt , he became enraptured , and tears filled his eyes .
arriving at the , nekhludoff met the usher in the corridor and asked him where the prisoners already sentenced were kept , and from whom permission could be obtained to see them .
the usher told him that the prisoners were kept in various places , and that before final judgment the public prosecutor was the only person from whom permission to see them could be obtained .
the prosecutor has not arrived yet ; when he does i will let you know , and will escort you myself to him after the session .
and now , please to walk into the court .
the session is commencing .
nekhludoff thanked the usher , who seemed to him particularly pitiful , and went into the .
as nekhludoff was approaching the his fellow jurors were coming out , repairing to the .
the merchant was as cheerful , had lunched as well as yesterday , and greeted nekhludoff like an old friend .
the loud laughter and familiarity of peter gerasimovitch did not give rise in nekhludoff of the unpleasant sensation of yesterday .
nekhludoff wished to tell all the jurymen of his relations to the woman whom they had convicted yesterday .
it would have been proper , he thought , yesterday to rise in court and publicly confess my guilt .
but when with the other jurymen he entered the and witnessed the same procedure , the same hear ye !
hear ye !
the three judges in high collars on the elevation , the silence , the seating of the jury on chairs , the gendarmes , the priest he felt that , though it was necessary to do it , he would not have been able even yesterday to break this solemnity .
they went through the same preliminaries , except the swearing in of the jury and the justiciary speech to them .
a case of burglary was before the court .
the prisoner , who was guarded by two gendarmes with unsheathed swords , was a boy with a bloodless face and in a gray coat .
he sat alone on the prisoners ' bench and scanned from under his eyebrows all those that entered the .
this boy and another were charged with breaking the lock of a shed and stealing therefrom mats of the value of three rubles and kopecks .
it appeared from the indictment that a policeman caught the boy when he was walking with the other , who carried the mats on his shoulder .
both of them immediately confessed , and they were put in jail .
the comrade of this boy , a locksmith , died in jail , and he was tried alone .
the old mats lay on the table reserved for exhibits .
the case was conducted in the same order as yesterday , with all the proofs , witnesses , experts , , examinations and .
the policeman , when questioned by the justiciary , complainant and the defense , made listless answers yes , sir , tell , and again yes , sir but notwithstanding this , it was apparent that he pitied the boy and testified involuntarily against him .
another witness , a splenetic old man who owned those mats , when asked if they belonged to him , unwillingly testified that they were his .
when , however , the prosecutor asked him what use he intended to make of them , and whether he needed them much , he became angry and answered i wish they had been lost entirely , these mats .
i need them at all .
and if i had known that you would make so much fuss about them , i would gladly have given ten rubles , or twenty , rather than be dragged into court .
i have spent five rubles on carriages coming here and going back again .
and i am sick ; i am suffering from rupture and rheumatism .
the prisoner admitted the charge against him , and , like a trapped animal , stupidly looked now to one side , now to the other , and in a halting voice related everything as it happened .
it was a clear case , but the prosecutor , as he did yesterday , raised his shoulders and propounded subtle questions which were calculated to entrap the clever criminal .
in his speech he argued that the theft was committed in a by breaking and entering it , and that therefore the severest punishment should be meted out to him .
counsel for the defense , appointed by the court , argued that the theft was committed not in a , and that , though the prisoner pleaded guilty , he was not as dangerous to society as the prosecutor would have them believe .
the justiciary was the personification of impartiality and justice , and endeavored to impress on the jury that which they already knew and could not help knowing .
again they took recesses and smoked cigarettes , and again the usher shouted hear ye !
and the two gendarmes sat trying to keep awake .
it developed during the trial that this boy had been apprenticed in a tobacco factory , in which he worked five years .
this year he was discharged by his employer after a misunderstanding with the employees , and , going idly about the city , he spent all he had on drink .
at an inn he met a locksmith who had also been discharged and was drinking hard , and the two went at night , while drunk , to that shed , broke the lock , and took the first thing they saw .
they were caught , and as they confessed they were imprisoned .
the locksmith , while waiting for a trial , died .
the boy was now being tried as a dangerous creature from whom it was necessary to protect society .
as dangerous a creature as the prisoner of yesterday , nekhludoff thought while watching the proceedings .
they are dangerous , but are we not dangerous ?
i am a libertine , an impostor ; and all of us , all those that know me as i am , not only do not detest but respect me .
it is evident that this boy is no villain , but a very ordinary person every one sees that and that he became what he is only because he lived amid conditions that beget such people .
it is therefore plain that such boys will exist as long as the conditions producing these unfortunates remain unchanged .
if any one had taken pity on this boy , nekhludoff thought while looking at the sickly , frightened face of the boy , before want had driven him from the village to the city , and relieved that want , or , when , after twelve hours ' work in the factory , he was visiting inns with comrades , some one had told him , do go , vania ; it is bad , the boy would not have gone , or got drunk , and the burglary would never have occurred .
but no one pitied the boy during the time that he , like an animal , spent his school years in the city , and , with hair , to prevent his getting vermin , ran errands for the workmen .
on the contrary , the only thing he had heard from the workmen and his comrades was to the effect that a brave fellow was he who cheated , drank , reviled , fought , or led a depraved life .
and when , sickly and depraved from the unhealthy work , from drink and lewdness , foolish and capricious , he aimlessly prowled around the city , as in a dream , entered some shed and abstracted a few worthless mats , then , instead of destroying the causes that led this boy into his present condition , we intend to mend matters by punishing him !
it is dreadful !
thus nekhludoff thought , and no longer listened to what was going on around him .
he was himself terrified at this revelation .
he wondered why he had not seen it before how others failed to see it .
as soon as the first recess was taken , nekhludoff rose and went out of the court , intending to return no more .
they might do with him what they pleased , but he could no longer take part in that farce .
having inquired where the prosecutor room was , he directed his steps toward that dignitary .
the messenger would not admit him , declaring that the prosecutor was busy , but nekhludoff brushed past him and asked an officer who met him to announce him to the prosecutor , saying that he was on important business .
his title and dress helped nekhludoff .
the officer announced him , and he was admitted .
the prosecutor received him standing , evidently dissatisfied with nekhludoff persistence in seeking an audience with him .
what do you wish ?
the prosecutor asked , sternly .
i am a juryman , my name is nekhludoff , and i want to see the prisoner maslova , he said , resolutely and quickly .
he blushed , and felt that his act would have a decisive influence on his life .
the prosecutor was a tall , swarthy man with short hair just turning gray , bright eyes and a trimmed , bushy beard on the protruding lower jaw .
maslova ?
yes , i know her .
she was charged with poisoning , he said calmly .
why do you want to see her ?
and then , as if desiring to soften his harsh demeanor , he added i can not give you the permission before i know what you want to see her for .
it is very important for me to see her , nekhludoff burst out .
i see , said the prosecutor , and , raising his eyes , looked intently at nekhludoff .
has her case been tried ?
she was tried yesterday and sentenced to four years ' penal servitude .
the conviction was irregular ; she is innocent .
i see .
if she has only been sentenced yesterday , said the prosecutor without paying attention to nekhludoff declaration about her innocence , then she will be detained until final judgment in the place where she is now .
the jail is open to visitors on certain days only .
i advise you to apply there .
but i must see her as soon as possible , with trembling lower jaw nekhludoff said , feeling that a critical moment was approaching .
why are you so anxious about seeing her ?
the prosecutor asked , raising his eyebrows with some alarm .
because she is innocent of the crime for which she was sentenced to penal servitude .
the guilt is mine , not hers , nekhludoff said in a trembling voice , feeling that he was saying what he should not .
how so ?
asked the prosecutor .
i deceived her , and brought her to the condition in which she is now .
if i had not driven her to the position in which she was , she would not have been charged here with such a crime .
still i fail to see what all this has to do with visiting her .
it has , because i want to follow her and marry her , said nekhludoff .
and , as it usually happened when he spoke of this , his eyes filled with tears .
illustration .
ah , is that so ?
said the prosecutor .
this is really an exceptional case .
are you not a member of the krasnopersk town council ?
asked the prosecutor , as if recalling that he had heard of this nekhludoff who was now making such a strange statement .
excuse me , but i fail to see what this has to do with my request , fuming , nekhludoff answered with rancor .
nothing , of course , the prosecutor said , with a faint smile on his face , and not in the least disturbed .
but your request is so unusual and beside all customary forms well , can i get the permission ?
permission ?
why , yes .
i will give you a pass immediately .
please be seated .
he went to the table , sat down and began to write .
please be seated .
nekhludoff stood still .
when he had made out the pass the prosecutor handed it to nekhludoff and eyed him with curiosity .
i must also tell you , said nekhludoff , that i can not continue to serve as juror .
as you know , satisfactory reasons must be given to the court in such cases .
the reasons are that i consider all courts useless and immoral .
i see , said the prosecutor , with the same faint smile which seemed to indicate that such statements were familiar to him , and belonged to an amusing class of people well known to him .
i see , but you understand that , as public prosecutor , i can not agree with you .
i therefore advise you to state so to the court , which will either find your reasons satisfactory or unsatisfactory , and in the latter case will impose a fine on you .
apply to the court .
i have already stated my reasons , and i will not go there , nekhludoff said angrily .
i have the honor to salute you , said the prosecutor , bowing , evidently desiring to rid himself of the strange visitor .
who was the man that just left your room ?
asked one of the judges who entered the prosecutor cabinet after nekhludoff had left .
nekhludoff .
you know , the one who made such strange suggestions in the krasnopersk town council .
just imagine , he is on the jury , and among the prisoners there was a woman , or girl , who was sentenced to penal servitude , and who , he says , was deceived by him .
and now he wishes to marry her .
it is impossible !
that is what he told me .
and how strangely excited he was !
there is something wrong with our young men .
he is not so very young .
what a bore your famous ivasheukoff is , my dear !
he wins his cases by tiring us out there is no end to his talking .
they must be curbed , or they become real obstructionists .
from the public prosecutor nekhludoff went straight to the .
but no one by the name of maslova was there .
the inspector told him that she might be found in the old temporary prison .
nekhludoff went there and found that katherine moslova was one of the inmates .
the distance between the and the old prison was great , and nekhludoff did not arrive there until toward evening .
he was about to open the door of the huge , gloomy building , when the guard stopped him and rang the bell .
the warden responded to the bell .
nekhludoff showed the pass , but the warden told him that he could not be admitted without authority from the inspector .
while climbing the stairs to the inspector dwelling , nekhludoff heard the sounds of an intricate bravura played on the piano .
and when the servant , with a handkerchief tied around one eye , opened the door , a flood of music dazed his senses .
it was a tiresome rhapsody by lizst , well played , but only to a certain place .
when that place was reached , the melody repeated itself .
nekhludoff asked the servant if the inspector was in .
the servant said that he was not .
will he be in soon ?
the rhapsody again ceased , and with a noisy flourish again repeated itself .
i will go and inquire .
and the servant went away .
the rhapsody again went on at full speed , when suddenly , reaching a certain point , it came to a and a voice from within was heard .
tell him that he is not home , and will not come .
he is visiting why do they bother us ?
a woman voice was heard to say , and the rhapsody continued , then ceased , and the sound of a chair moved back was heard .
the angry pianist herself evidently wished to reprimand the importunate visitor who came at such a late hour .
papa is not home , angrily said a pale , wretched looking girl with hair and blue spots under her eyes , who came to the door .
seeing a young man in a good overcoat , she became calm .
walk in , please .
what do you wish to see him for ?
i would like to see a prisoner .
i hold a pass from the prosecutor .
well , i do know ; papa is not in .
why , walk in , please , she again called from the entrance hall .
or apply to his assistant , who is now in the office .
you may talk to him .
and what is your name ?
thank you , said nekhludoff , without answering the question , and went away .
scarcely had the door closed when the same vigorous , merry sound , so inappropriate to the place and so persistently rehearsed by the wretched girl , was heard .
in the nekhludoff met a young officer with a stiff , dyed mustache , of whom he inquired for the assistant .
he himself was the assistant .
he took the pass , looked at it , and said that he could not admit any one to the prison on a pass for the .
besides , it was late .
at ten the prison is open to all visitors , and the inspector will be here .
you could then see her in the common , or , if the inspector permits it , in the office .
so , without gaining an interview , nekhludoff returned home .
agitated by the expectation of seeing her , he walked along the streets , thinking not of the court , but of his conversations with the prosecutor and the inspectors .
that he was seeking an interview with her , and told the prosecutor of his intention , and visited two prisons preparing for the ordeal , had so excited him that he could not calm down .
on returning home he immediately brought forth his unused diary , read some parts and made the following entry for two years i have kept no diary , and thought that i should never again return to this childishness .
but it was no childishness , but a discourse with myself , with that true , divine which lives in every man .
all this time this was slumbering and i had no one to discourse with .
it was awakened by the extraordinary event of the of april , in court , where i sat as jurymen .
i saw her , katiousha , whom i had deceived , on the prisoners ' bench , in a prison coat .
through a strange misunderstanding and my mistake , she was sentenced to penal servitude .
i have just returned from the prosecutor and the prison .
i was not permitted to see her , but i am determined to do anything to see her , acknowledge my guilt and make reparation even by marrying her .
lord , help me !
my soul is rejoicing .
for a long time that night maslova lay awake with open eyes , and , looking at the door , mused .
she was thinking that under no circumstances would she marry a convict on the island of saghalin , but would settle down some other way with some inspector , or clerk , or even the warden , or an assistant .
they are all eager for such a thing .
only i must not get thin .
otherwise i am done for .
and she recalled how she was looked at by her lawyer , the justiciary in fact , everybody in the .
she recalled how bertha , who visited her in prison , told her that the student , whom she loved while she was an inmate at kitaeva , inquired about her and expressed his regrets when told of her condition .
she recalled the fight with the woman , and pitied her .
she called to mind the baker who sent her an extra lunch roll , and many others , but not nekhludoff .
of her childhood and youth , and especially of her love for nekhludoff , she never thought .
that was too painful .
these recollections were hidden deeply in her soul .
she never saw nekhludoff even in a dream .
she failed to recognize him in court , not so much because when she last saw him he was an army officer , beardless , with small mustache and thick , short hair , while now he was no longer young in appearance , and wore a beard , but more because she never thought of him .
she had buried all recollections of her past relations with him in that terrible dark night when , on his return from the army , he visited his aunts .
up to that night , while she hoped for his return , the child which she bore under her heart was not irksome to her .
but from that night forward everything changed , and the coming child was only a hindrance .
the aunts had asked nekhludoff to stop off at their station and call on them , but he wired that he would not be able to do it , as he had to reach petersburg in time .
when katiousha learned this , she decided to go to the railroad station to see him .
the train was to pass at two in the morning .
katiousha helped the ladies to bed , and , having induced the cook girl , mashka , to accompany her , she put on an old pair of shoes , threw a shawl over her head , gathered up her skirts and ran to the station .
it was a dark , rainy , windy , autumn night .
the rain now poured down in large , warm drops , now ceased .
the road could not be distinguished in the field , and it was pitch dark in the woods .
although katiousha was familiar with the road she lost her way in the woods , and reached a , where the train only stopped for three minutes .
running on the platform , she espied nekhludoff through the window of a car .
the car was brightly illuminated .
two officers sat on plush seats playing cards .
on the table near the window two thick candles were burning .
nekhludoff sat on the arm of the seat , his elbow resting on the back , laughing .
as soon as she recognized him she tapped on the window with her cold hand .
but at that moment the third bell rang , and the train began to move , the cars jostling each other forward .
one of the players rose with the cards in his hands and began to look through the window .
she tapped again , and pressed her face against the .
at that moment the car beside which she stood was tugged forward , and it moved along .
she ran alongside , looking in the window .
the officer tried to lower the window , but could not .
nekhludoff rose , and , pushing the officer aside , began lowering it .
the train went faster , so that katiousha was obliged to run .
the train moved still faster when the window was lowered .
at that moment the conductor pushed her aside and jumped on the car .
she fell back , but continued to run along the wet boards of the platform , and when she reached the end of the platform and began to descend the steps to the ground , she almost fell exhausted .
the car was far ahead of her , and while she was running the cars passed her , then came with greater speed those of the third class .
when the last car with the lanterns flew by her she was already beyond the , unsheltered from the wind which lashed her , blowing the shawl from her head and tangling her feet in her skirt .
but still she ran on .
aunt michaelovna !
shouted the little girl , you have lost your shawl .
katiousha stopped , threw back her head , and , covering her face with her hands , began to sob .
he is gone !
she cried .
while he is in a lighted car , sitting on a plush seat , jesting and drinking , i stand here in the mud , rain and wind , crying , she thought .
she sat down on the ground and began to sob aloud .
the little girl was frightened , and , embracing her wet clothing , she said auntie , let go home .
i will wait for the next train , throw myself under the wheels , and that will end it all , katiousha was meanwhile thinking , not heeding the girl .
she made up her mind to carry out her intention .
but as it always happens in the first moment of calm after a period of agitation , the child , child , suddenly shuddered .
immediately all that which so tortured her that she was willing to die , all her wrath and her desire to revenge herself even by death , passed .
she became calm , arranged her clothing , put the shawl on her head , and went away .
she returned home exhausted , wet and muddy .
from that day began in her that spiritual transformation which ended in her present condition .
from that terrible night on she ceased to believe in god and in goodness .
before that night she herself believed in god , and believed that other people believed in him ; but after that night she became convinced that no one believed , and all that was said of god and his law was false and wrong .
the one whom she loved , and who loved her she knew it abandoned her and made sport of her feelings .
and he was the best of all the men she knew .
all the others were even worse .
this she saw confirmed in all that had happened .
his aunts , pious old ladies , drove her out when she was no longer as useful as she used to be .
all the women with whom she came in contact tried to make money by her ; the men , beginning with the commissary and down to the prison officers , all looked upon her as a means of pleasure .
the whole world was after pleasure .
her belief in this was strengthened by the old author whom she met during the second year of her independent life .
he had told her frankly that this he called it poetical and esthetic is all of life happiness .
every one lived for himself only , for his own pleasure , and all the words about god and goodness were deception .
and if the questions sometimes occurred to her , why were the affairs of the world so ill arranged that people harm each other , and all suffer , she thought it best not to dwell on it .
if she became lonesome , she took a drink , smoked a cigarette , and the feeling would pass away .
when at five the following morning , which was sunday , the customary whistle blew , korableva , who was already awake , roused maslova .
a convict , maslova thought with horror , rubbing her eyes and involuntarily inhaling the foul morning air .
she wished to fall asleep again , to transfer herself into a state of unconsciousness , but fear overcame her drowsiness .
she raised herself , crossed her legs under her , and looked around .
the women were already up , only the children were still sleeping .
the moonshining woman with bulging eyes was carefully removing her coat from under them .
the rioter was drying near the oven some rags which served for swaddling cloths , while the child , in the hands of the theodosia , was crying at the top of its lungs , the woman lulling it in a gentle voice .
the consumptive , seizing her breast , coughed violently , and , sighing at intervals , almost screamed .
the woman lay prone on her back relating a dream she had had .
the old incendiary stood before the image , whispering the same words , crossing herself and bowing .
the daughter sat motionless on her cot , and with dull , eyes was looking into space .
miss dandy was curling on her finger her oily , rough , black hair .
presently resounding steps were heard in the corridor , the lock creaked open , and two prisoners in short jackets and gray trousers scarcely reaching their ankles entered , and , raising the vat on a yoke , carried it away .
the women went to the faucets in the corridor to wash themselves .
the woman got into a quarrel with a woman from the adjoining cell .
again there were cursing , shouting and complaints .
you will get into the yet , shouted the warden , and he slapped the woman on her fat , bare back , so that it resounded through the entire corridor .
do let me hear you again .
fooling again , you old man ?
she said , treating it as a caress .
hurry up !
it is time for mass .
scarcely had maslova arranged her hair when the inspector entered with his attendants .
make ready for inspection !
shouted the warden .
the women of the two cells formed in two rows along the corridor , those of the back row placing their hands on the shoulders of the women in the front row .
then they were counted .
after the count came the woman inspector and led the prisoners to the church .
maslova and theodosia were in the middle of the column , which consisted of over a hundred women from all the cells .
they all had white on their heads , and some few wore their own colored dresses .
these were the wives and children of convicts .
the procession covered the whole stairway .
a soft clatter of prison shoes was heard , here and there some conversation , and sometimes laughter .
at a turn maslova noticed the malicious face of her enemy , bochkova , who was walking in the front row , and pointed her out to theodosia .
at the foot of the stairs the women became silent , and , making the sign of the cross and bowing , they filed into the open door of the empty , chapel .
their place was on the right , where , crowding each other , they began to arrange themselves in rows , standing .
behind the women came the male convicts who were serving terms or detained for transportation under sentence by the communities .
loudly clearing their throats , they formed a dense crowd on the left and the middle of the chapel .
above , on the gallery , were other convicts with heads half shaven , whose presence was manifested by a clanking of chains .
this prison chapel had been rebuilt and remodeled by a rich merchant , who had spent about thirty thousand rubles on it , and it was all ornamented with gilt and bright colors .
for a few seconds there was silence , which was broken only by the blowing of noses , coughing , and clanking of chains .
suddenly the prisoners who stood in the middle began to press back , making a passage for the inspector , who walked to the middle of the chapel , and the services commenced .
nekhludoff left the house early .
a peasant was driving along a side alley , shouting in a strange voice milk !
milk !
milk !
the first warm , spring rain had fallen the evening before .
wherever there was a patch of unpaved ground the green grass burst forth ; the lindens were covered with green nap ; the and poplar unfolded their long , fragrant leaves .
in the , through which nekhludoff had to pass , dense crowds in rags swarmed before the tents , some carrying boots under their arms , others smoothly pressed trousers and vests on their shoulders .
the working people were already crowding near the traktirs ( ) , the men in clean , long coats gathered in folds in the back of the waist , and in shining boots ; the women in silk shawls and cloaks with trimmings .
policemen , with pistols attached to yellow cords fastened around their waists , stood at their posts .
children and dogs played on the , and gay nurses sat chatting on the benches .
on the streets , the left sides of which were yet cool , moist and shady , heavy carts and light cabs rumbled and jostled , the rang their bells .
the air was agitated by the pealing of the summoning the people to mass .
the driver stopped at a turn some distance from the prison .
a few men and women stood around , most of them with bundles in their hands .
to the right stood a few frame houses ; to the left a building over which hung a large sign .
the large prison itself was directly in front .
an armed soldier walked to and fro challenging every one attempting to pass him .
at the gate of the frame buildings sat the warden in uniform , with an entry booklet in his hand .
he made entries of visitors and those whom they wished to see .
nekhludoff approached him , gave his name and that of moslova , and the officer entered them in his book .
why do they open the door ?
asked nekhludoff .
the morning service is on .
as soon as it is over you will be admitted .
nekhludoff returned among the waiting crowd .
a man in threadbare clothing , rumpled hat and slippers on his bare feet , and his face full of red lines , pushed his way through the crowd and walked toward the prison door .
where are you going ?
shouted the soldier .
what are you bawling about ?
answered the man , entirely undisturbed by the soldier challenge .
if i ca go in , i will wait .
no use bawling as if you were a general .
the crowd laughed approvingly .
most of the visitors were poorly dressed , even ragged , but , judging by outward appearance , there were also some decent men and women among them .
beside nekhludoff stood a man , clean shaven , stout and with rosy cheeks , who carried a bundle of what looked like linen .
nekhludoff asked him if that was his first visit .
the man answered that he came there every sunday , and they entered into conversation .
he was an employee of a bank , whose brother was under indictment for forgery .
this man told nekhludoff all his story , and was about to ask him about his own when their attention was attracted by a carriage drawn by a blooded chestnut horse .
the carriage was occupied by a student and a lady whose face was hidden under a veil .
the student alighted , holding in his hand a large bundle .
he approached nekhludoff and asked him where and how he should deliver the loaves of bread he had brought for the prisoners .
i brought them at the request of my bride .
that is my bride .
her parents advised us to bring some alms for the prisoners .
i really do know , for i am here for the first time , but i think that that officer will tell you , said nekhludoff , pointing to the warden in the uniform .
while nekhludoff was talking to the student the large iron gate of the prison opened and a uniformed officer with another warden came out .
the one with the booklet in his hand announced that the prison was open for visitors .
the guard stood aside , and all the visitors , as if fearing to be late , with quick step , and some even running , pressed toward the prison gate .
one of the wardens stationed himself at the gate , and in a loud voice counted the passing visitors , , , etc .
the other warden , within the gate , touching each with his hand , also counted the visitors as they entered another door .
this was to make sure that at their departure no visitor remained in prison , and no prisoner made his way out .
the tallying officer , without regard to the person of the visitor , slapped nekhludoff on the back .
this at first offended the latter , but he immediately remembered his mission , and he became ashamed that his feelings should be thus wounded .
the second door opened into a large , vaulted room with small windows .
in this room , which was called the , nekhludoff saw in a niche a large image of the crucifixion .
nekhludoff went on slowly , letting the hurrying visitors pass before , and experienced a mingled feeling of horror at the malefactors imprisoned in this jail , compassion for those innocent people who , like the boy and katiousha , must be here , and timidity and tenderness before the meeting that was before him .
when he reached the end of the room the warden said something , but nekhludoff , who was absorbed in his thoughts , paid no attention to it , and followed in the direction led by the crowd , that is , to the men ward instead of the women .
letting the hurrying visitors pass , he walked into the next room designated for interviews .
on opening the door he was struck by the deafening shouts of a hundred throats turned into a continuous humming noise .
only as he neared the people , who , like flies swarming on sugar pressed their faces against a net which divided the room in two , did nekhludoff understand the cause of the noise .
this room with windows in the rear wall was divided in two not by one , but by two wire nets which stretched from the ceiling to the floor .
two wardens walked between the nets .
the prisoners were on the other side of the nets , between which there was a space of about seven feet for visitors , so that not only was it difficult to converse with them but a man could not even see the face of the prisoner he was visiting .
in order to be heard , it was necessary to shout at the top of one voice .
on both sides , pressing against the nets , were the faces of wives , husbands , fathers , mothers , children , who endeavored to see and speak to each other .
but as every one tried to speak so that he could be heard by the person spoken to , and his neighbor did the same , their voices interfered with each other , and each tried to outcry the other .
the result was the noise which astonished nekhludoff when he entered the room .
it was absolutely impossible to understand the conversations .
only by the expression of the people faces could one judge what they were speaking about , and what relation the speakers sustained toward each other .
near nekhludoff was an old woman with a small on her head , who , with trembling chin , shouted to a pale young man with head half shaven .
the prisoner , knitting his brow , was listening to her with raised eyebrows .
beside the old woman stood a young man in a long coat , who was nodding his head while listening to a prisoner with a weary face and beard turning gray , who greatly resembled him .
further on stood a ragamuffin waving his hand , shouting and laughing .
on the floor beside this man sat a woman in a good woolen dress , with a child in her arms .
she wept bitterly , evidently seeing for the first time that man on the other side of the net , manacled , in a prison jacket , and with head half shaven .
over this woman stood the bank employee shouting at the top of his voice to a prisoner with shining eyes .
nekhludoff remained in this room about five minutes , experiencing a strange feeling of anguish , a consciousness of his impotence at the discord in the world , and he was seized with a sensation like a rocking on board of a ship .
but i must fulfill my mission , he said to himself , taking heart .
what am i to do ?
as he looked around for some officer , he saw a man with mustache , wearing epaulets , who was walking behind the crowd .
sir , could you not tell me where the women are kept , and where it is permitted to see them ?
he asked , making a particular effort to be polite .
you wish to go to the women ward ?
yes ; i would like to see one of the women prisoners , nekhludoff said , with the same strained politeness .
you should have said so in the .
whom do you wish to see , then ?
i wish to see katherine maslova .
has she been sentenced ?
yes , she was sentenced the other day , he said humbly , as if fearing to ruffle the temper of the officer , who seemed to be interested in him .
then this way , please , said the inspector , who had evidently decided from nekhludoff appearance that he deserved attention .
sidoroff !
he turned to a wearing a mustache , and medals on his breast .
show this gentleman to the women ward .
all right , sir .
at that moment cries came from the direction of the grating .
all this seemed strange to nekhludoff , and strangest of all was that he was obliged to thank and feel himself under obligation to the inspector and warden .
the warden led nekhludoff from the men ward into the corridor , and through the open door opposite admitted him to the .
this room , like the one in the men ward , was also divided in three , by two nets , but it was considerably smaller .
there were also fewer visitors and fewer prisoners , but the noise was as great as in the men room .
here , also , the authorities stood guard between the nets .
the authorities were here represented by a matron in uniform with sleeves and fringed with blue braid and a belt of the same color .
here , too , people pressed against the nets in the passage city folks in divers dresses ; behind the nets , female prisoners , some in white , others in their own dresses .
the whole net was lined with people .
some stood on , speaking over the heads of others ; others , again , sat on the floor and conversed .
the most remarkable of the women prisoners , both in her shouting and appearance , was a thin , ragged gipsy , with a which had slipped from her head , who stood almost in the middle of the room , near a post , behind the net , gesticulating and shouting to a short and tightly belted gipsy in a blue coat .
a soldier sat beside him on the floor , talking to a prisoner .
beyond stood a young peasant with a light beard and in bast shoes , pressing his flushed face to the net , evidently with difficulty suppressing his tears .
he was talking to a pretty , prisoner who gazed at him with her bright , blue eyes .
this was theodosia , with her husband .
beside them stood a tramp , who was talking to a disheveled , woman .
further on there were two women , a man , and again a woman , and opposite each was a prisoner .
maslova was not among them .
but behind the prisoners stood another woman .
nekhludoff felt the beating of his heart increasing and his breath failing him .
the decisive moment was approaching .
he neared the net and recognized katiousha .
she stood behind the theodosia , and , smiling , listened to her conversation .
she did not wear the prison coat , but a white waist , tightly belted , and rising high above the breast .
as in the court , her black hair hung in curls over her forehead .
it will all be over in a moment , he thought .
shall i address her , or shall i wait till she addresses me ?
but she did not address him .
she was waiting for clara , and never thought that that man came to see her .
whom do you wish to see ?
the matron asked nekhludoff , approaching him .
katherine maslova , he stammered .
maslova , you are wanted , shouted the matron .
maslova turned round , raised her head , and with the familiar expression of submissiveness , came to the net .
she did not recognize nekhludoff , and gazed at him in surprise .
however , judging by his dress that he was a rich man , she smiled .
what are you ?
she asked , pressing her smiling face with squinting eyes against the net .
i wish to see he did not know whether to use the respectful you or the endearing thou , and decided on the former .
he spoke no louder than usual .
i wish to see you i do give me any of your song and dance the tramp beside him shouted .
did you take it , or did you not ?
she is dying ; she is very weak , some one shouted on the other side .
maslova could not hear nekhludoff , but the expression of his face , as she spoke , suddenly reminded her of that which she did not wish to think of .
the smile disappeared from her face , and a wrinkle on her brow evidenced her suffering .
i can not hear what you are saying , she shouted , blinking and still more knitting her brows .
i came yes , i am doing my duty ; i am repenting , thought nekhludoff , and immediately tears filled his eyes , and he felt a choking sensation in his throat .
his fingers clutched at the net and he made efforts to keep from sobbing .
i should not have gone if you were well , came from one side .
i swear by god i know nothing about it !
cried a prisoner from the other side .
maslova noticed his agitation , and it communicated itself to her .
her eyes sparkled , and her puffy , white cheeks became covered with red spots , but her face retained its severity , and her squinting eyes stared past him .
you are like him , but i do know you , she shouted .
i came here to ask your forgiveness , he said in a loud voice , without intonation , as if repeating a lesson he had learned by heart .
as he said these words he felt ashamed and looked round .
but the thought immediately came to his mind that it was well that he was ashamed , for he ought to bear the shame .
and in a loud voice he continued i acted meanly , infamously forgive me .
she stood motionless , her squinting eyes fixed on him .
he could not continue and left the net , making efforts to stifle the sobbing which was convulsing his breast .
the inspector who directed nekhludoff to the women ward , evidently becoming interested in him , came into the room , and , seeing him in the middle of the passage , asked him why he was not speaking with the prisoner he had inquired about .
nekhludoff blew his nose , and , endeavoring to assume an air of calmness , said i ca speak through the net ; nothing can be heard .
the inspector mused awhile .
well , then , she can be brought out for awhile .
maria karlovna !
he turned to the matron .
lead maslova out .
a moment afterward maslova came out through a side door .
with gentle step she came up to nekhludoff ; stopped and glanced at him from under her lowered eyebrows .
her black hair stood out on her forehead in curly ringlets ; her unhealthy , bloated , white face was pretty and very calm , only her , squinting eyes sparkled from under their swollen lashes .
you may talk here , said the inspector and went aside .
nekhludoff moved toward a bench standing beside the wall .
maslova glanced inquiringly at the inspector , and shrugging her shoulders , as if in wonder , followed nekhludoff to the bench , and straightening her skirt , sat down beside him .
i know that it is hard for you to forgive me , began nekhludoff , but feeling the tears flooding his eyes , again stopped , but if the past can not be mended , i will do now everything in my power .
tell me how did you find me ?
she asked without answering his question , her squinting eyes looking and not looking at him .
oh , lord !
help me , teach me what to do !
nekhludoff said to himself as he looked at her face so completely changed .
i was on the jury when you were tried , he said .
you did not recognize me ?
no , i did not .
i had no time to recognize you .
besides , i did not look , she answered .
was there a child ?
he asked , and he felt his face turning red .
it died at that time , thank god , she said with bitterness , turning away her head .
how did it happen ?
i was ill myself nearly died , she said without raising her eyes .
how could the aunts let you go ?
who would keep a servant with a child ?
as soon as they noticed it they drove me out .
but what is the use of talking !
i do remember anything .
it is all over now .
no , it is not over .
i can not leave it thus .
i now wish to atone for my sin .
there is nothing to atone for ; what gone is gone , she said , and , all unexpected to him , she suddenly looked at him and smiled in an alluring and piteous manner .
his appearance was entirely unexpected to maslova , especially at this time and place , and therefore the astonishment of the first moment brought to her mind that of which she never thought before .
at the first moment she hazily recalled that new , wonderful world of feeling and thought which had been opened to her by that charming young man who loved her , and whom she loved , and then his inexplicable cruelty and the long chain of humiliation and suffering which followed as the direct result of that enchanting bliss , and it pained her .
but being unable to account for it all , she did the customary thing for her banished all these recollections from her mind , and endeavored to obscure them by a life of dissipation .
at first she associated this man who sat beside her with that young man whom she had loved once , but as the thought pained her , she drove it from her mind .
and now this neatly dressed gentleman , with perfumed beard , was to her not that nekhludoff whom she had loved , but one of those people who , as opportunity afforded , were taking advantage of such creatures as she , and of whom such creatures as she ought to take advantage as opportunity offers .
for this reason she smiled alluringly .
she was silent , thinking how to profit by him .
all that is over now , she said .
and here i am , sentenced to penal servitude .
her lips trembled as she spoke the terrible word .
i knew , i was certain that you were innocent , said nekhludoff .
of course i was innocent .
i am no thief or robber .
they say here that it all depends on the lawyer ; that it is necessary to appeal .
only they say it comes very high yes , certainly , said nekhludoff .
i have already seen a lawyer .
one must not be sparing , and get a good one , she said .
i will do everything in my power .
they were silent .
she again smiled as before .
i would like to ask you for some money , if you have it not much , say ten rubles , she said suddenly .
yes , yes , said nekhludoff , abashed , and thrust his hand in his pocket .
she quickly glanced at the inspector , who was walking up and down the aisle .
do let him see it , or he will take it away .
nekhludoff took out his pocketbook as soon as the director turned his back on them , but before he could hand her the bill the inspector turned round , facing them .
he crumpled the bill in his hand .
why , she is a dead woman , thought nekhludoff as he looked at her once lovely , but now defiled , bloated face with the unhealthy sparkle in her black , squinting eyes , which looked now at the inspector , now at nekhludoff hand with the crumpled bill .
and a moment of hesitation came over him .
again the tempter of the night before whispered in his soul , endeavoring to turn the question , what would be the best thing to do ?
into , what will be the end of it ?
you can do nothing with that woman , whispered the voice .
she will be like a stone around your neck , which will drag you down , and prevent your being useful to others .
give her all the money you have , bid her and put an end to it for all time .
and immediately he became aware that something important was taking place in his soul ; that his inner life was on a wavering scale , which could by the slightest effort be made to overbalance to one side or the other .
and he made that effort , calling on that god whom the other day he felt in his soul , and god immediately came to his aid .
he resolved to tell her all .
katiousha !
i came to ask your forgiveness , but you have not answered me whether you have forgiven me , or ever will forgive me , he said suddenly .
she was not listening to him , but looked now at his hand , now at the inspector .
when the latter turned away , she quickly stretched forth her hand , seized the money from nekhludoff hand and stuck it behind her belt .
how funny !
she said , smiling contemptuously as it seemed to him .
nekhludoff saw that there was something inimical to him in her , which stood guard , as it were , over her as she was now , and prevented him from penetrating into her heart .
but wonderful to relate so far from repulsing him , this only drew him to her by some new peculiar force .
he felt that he ought to awaken her spirit ; that it was extremely difficult to do so ; but the very difficulty of the undertaking attracted him .
he experienced a feeling toward her which he had never experienced before , either toward her or any one else , and in which there was nothing personal .
he desired nothing of her for himself , and only wished her to to cease to be what she was now , and become what she had been before .
katiousha , why do you speak thus ?
i know you , i remember you as you were in panoff but she did not yield she would not yield .
why recall the past !
she said dryly , frowning even more .
because i wish to efface , to expiate my sin .
katiousha he began , and was about to tell her that he would marry her , but he met her eyes in which he read something so terrible , rude and repulsive that he could not finish .
at that moment the visitors began to take leave .
the inspector approached nekhludoff and told him that the time for interviewing was ended .
maslova rose and submissively waited to be dismissed .
.
i have a great deal to tell you yet , but , as you see , i can not do it now , said nekhludoff , and extended his hand .
i will call again .
i think you have said everything she extended her hand , but did not press his .
no .
i will try to see you again , where we can speak together , and then i will tell you something very important , said nekhludoff .
well , all right , she said , smiling as she used to do when she wished to please a man .
you are more to me than a sister , said nekhludoff .
funny , she repeated , and , shaking her head , she went behind the grating .
nekhludoff expected that at the first meeting katiousha , learning of his intention to serve her , and of his repentance , would be moved to rejoicing , would become again katiousha , but to his surprise and horror , he saw that katiousha was no more ; that only maslova remained .
it surprised him particularly that not only was maslova not ashamed of her condition , but , on the contrary , she seemed to be content with , and even took pride in it .
and yet it could not be different .
it is usually thought that a thief or murderer , acknowledging the harmfulness of his occupation , ought to be ashamed of it .
the truth is just the contrary .
people , whom fate and their sinful mistakes have placed in a given condition , form such views of life generally that they are enabled to consider their condition useful and morally tenable .
in order , however , to maintain such views they instinctively cling to such circles in which the same views are held .
we are surprised when we hear thieves boasting of their cleverness , or murderers boasting of their cruelty , but that is only because their circle is limited , and because we are outside of it .
this was the case also with maslova .
she was sentenced to penal servitude , and yet she formed such views of life and her place in it that she could find reasons for and even boast before people of her condition .
the substance of this view was that the greatest welfare of all men , without exception young , old , students , generals , educated and uneducated consisted in associating with attractive women , and that therefore all men , while pretending to occupy themselves with other business , in reality desire nothing else .
now , she is an attractive woman , and can satisfy that desire of theirs , or not , as she wishes , hence she is a necessary and important person .
all her life , past and present , attested the justice of this view .
whomever she met during ten years , beginning with nekhludoff and the old commissary of police , and ending with the jailers , all wanted her .
she had not met any one who did not want her .
hence the world appeared to her as an aggregation of people who watched her from all sides and by all possible means deceit , violence , gold or craftiness strewn to possess her .
with such an idea of life , maslova considered herself a most important person .
and she cherished this view above all else in the world , because to change it would be to lose that standing among people which it assured her .
and in order not to lose her standing she instinctively clung to that circle which held the same views of life .
seeing , however , that nekhludoff wished to lead her into another world , she resisted it , feeling that in that other world into which he was luring her she would lose her present standing which gave her confidence and .
for the same reason she drove from her mind all recollection of her first youth and her first relations to nekhludoff .
these recollections clashed with her present views of life , and for that reason were entirely effaced from her memory , or , rather , were preserved somewhere in her memory , but were covered up , as it were , with a thick plastering , to prevent any access to them .
nekhludoff was , therefore , to her not that man whom she had loved with a pure love , but merely a rich gentleman by whom one may and ought to profit , and who was to be treated like any other man .
i did not tell her the most important thing , thought nekhludoff , as with the other people he walked toward the door .
i did not tell her that i would marry her , but i will do it .
the inspectors at the doors counted the visitors each with one hand slapping every visitor on the back .
but nekhludoff was not offended by it now ; he even took no notice of it .
it was nekhludoff intention to alter his manner of living discharge the servants , let the house and take rooms in a hotel .
but agrippina petrovna argued that no one would rent the house in the summer , and that as it was necessary to live somewhere and keep the furniture and things , he might as well remain where he was .
so that all efforts of nekhludoff to lead a simple , student life , came to naught .
not only was the old arrangement of things continued , but , as in former times , the house received a general cleaning .
first were brought out and hung on a rope uniforms and strange fur garments which were never used by anybody ; then carpets , furniture , and the porter , with his assistant , rolling up the sleeves on their muscular arms , began to beat these things , and the odor of camphor rose all over the house .
walking through the and looking out of the window , nekhludoff wondered at the great number of unnecessary things kept in the house .
the only purpose these things served , he thought , was to afford the servants an opportunity of exercise .
it is worth while to alter my mode of life while maslova affair is unsettled , he thought .
besides , it is too hard .
when she is discharged or transported and i follow her , things will change of their own accord .
on the day appointed by the lawyer fanirin , nekhludoff called on him .
on entering the magnificently appointed apartments of the house owned by the lawyer himself , with its huge plants , remarkable curtains and other evidences of luxury , attesting easily earned wealth , nekhludoff found in the a number of people sitting dejectedly around tables on which lay illustrated journals intended for their diversion .
the lawyer clerk , who was sitting in this room at a high desk , recognizing nekhludoff , greeted him and said that he would announce him .
but before the clerk reached the door of the cabinet , the door opened and the animated voices of a man with a red face and stubby mustache , wearing a new suit , and fanirin himself were heard .
the expression on their faces was such as is seen on people who had just made a profitable , but not very honest , bargain .
it is your own fault , my dear sir , fanirin said , smiling .
i would gladly go to heaven , but my sins prevent me .
that is all right .
and both laughed unnaturally .
ah , prince nekhludoff !
pleased to see you , said fanirin , and bowing again to the departing merchant , he led nekhludoff into his cabinet .
please take a cigarette , said the lawyer , seating himself opposite nekhludoff and suppressing a smile , called forth by the success of the preceding affair .
thank you .
i came to inquire about maslova case .
yes , yes , immediately .
my , what rogues these moneybags are !
he said .
you have seen that fellow ; he is worth twelve millions , and is the meanest skinflint i ever met .
nekhludoff felt an irresistible loathing toward this ready talker who , by his tone of voice , meant to show that he and nekhludoff belonged to a different sphere than the other clients .
he worried me to death .
he is an awful rogue .
i wanted to ease my mind , said the lawyer , as if justifying his not speaking about nekhludoff case .
and now as to your case .
i have carefully examined it , could not approve the contents thereof , ' as tourgeniff has it .
that is to say , the lawyer was a wretched one , and he let slip all the grounds of appeal .
what have you decided to do ?
one moment .
tell him , he turned to his clerk , who had just entered , that i will not change my terms .
he can accept them or not , as he pleases .
he does not accept them .
well , then , let him go , said the lawyer , and his benign and joyful countenance suddenly assumed a gloomy and angry expression .
they say that lawyers take money for nothing , he said , again assuming a pleasant expression .
i succeeded in obtaining the discharge of an insolent debtor who was incarcerated on flimsy accusations of fraud , and now they all run after me .
and every such case requires great labor .
we , too , you know , leave some of our flesh in the , as some author said .
well , now , your case , or rather the case in which you are interested , he continued ; was badly conducted .
there are no good grounds for appeal , but , of course , we can make an attempt .
this is what i have written .
he took a sheet of paper , and quickly swallowing some uninteresting , formal words , and emphasizing others , he began to read to the department of cassation , , , katherine , etc .
petition .
by the decision , , of the , rendered , , a certain maslova was found guilty of taking the life , by poisoning , of a certain sentenced to , with hard labor , etc .
he stopped , evidently listening with pleasure to his own composition , although from constant use he knew the forms by heart .
sentence is the result of grave errors , ' he continued with emphasis , ought to be reversed for the following reasons first , the reading in the indictment of the description of the entrails of smelkoff was interrupted by the justiciary at the very ' one .
but the prosecutor demanded its reading , nekhludoff said with surprise .
that is immaterial ; the defense could have demanded the same thing .
but that was entirely unnecessary .
no matter , it is a ground of appeal .
further .
attorney , ' he continued to read , interrupted while addressing the jury , by the justiciary , when , desiring to depict the character of maslova , he touched upon the inner causes of her fall .
the ground for refusing to permit him to continue his address was stated to be irrelevancy to the question at issue .
but as has often been pointed out by the senate , the character and moral features generally of an accused are to be given the greatest weight in determining the question of ' two .
but he spoke so badly that we could not understand him , said nekhludoff with still greater surprise .
he is a very foolish fellow and , of course , could say nothing sensible , fanirin said , laughing .
however , it is a ground for appeal .
.
in his closing words the justiciary , contrary to the positive requirements of section , chapter of the code of criminal procedure , failed to explain to the jury of what legal elements the theory of guilt consisted ; nor did he tell them that if they found that maslova gave the poison to smelkoff , but without intent to kill , they had the power to discharge her . '
this is the principal point .
we could have known that .
that was our mistake .
and finally , ' continued the lawyer .
answer of the jury to the question of maslova guilt was made in a form which was obviously contradictory .
maslova was charged with intentional poisoning of smelkoff , and with robbery as a motive , while the jury , in their answer , denied her guilt of the robbery , from which it was evident that they intended to acquit her of the intent to kill .
their failure to do so was due to the incomplete charge of the justiciary .
such an answer , therefore , demanded the application of chapters and of the code .
that is to say , it was the duty of the presiding justice to explain to the jury their mistake and refer the question of the guilt of the accused to them for further deliberation . '
why , then , did he not do it ?
that is just what i would like to know myself , said fanirin , laughing .
so the senate will correct the mistake .
that will depend on who will be sitting there when the case is heard .
well , and then we continue these circumstances the court erred in imposing on maslova punishment , and the application to her of section , chapter of the code was a serious violation of the basic principles of the criminal law .
wherefore applicant demands , , , be revised in accordance with chs .
, , , and of the code , , , and referring the case back for a new trial to a different part of the same court . '
well , now , everything that could be done was done .
but i will be frank with you ; the probabilities of success are slight .
however , everything depends on who will be sitting in the senate .
if you know any one among them , bestir yourself .
yes , i know some .
then you must hasten , for they will soon be gone on their vacation , and wo return for three months .
in case of failure , the only recourse will be to petition the czar .
i shall be at your service also in that contingency .
i thank you .
and now as to your honorarium ?
my clerk will hand you the petition and also my bill .
one more question i would like to ask you .
the prosecutor gave me a pass for the prison , but i was told there that it was necessary to obtain the governor permission to visit the prison on other than visitors ' days .
is it necessary ?
i think so .
but he is away , and the lieutenant is in his place .
you mean maslenikoff ?
yes .
i know him , said nekhludoff , rising to leave .
at that moment the lawyer wife , an extremely ugly , and bony woman , rushed into the room .
not only was her attire unusually original she was fairly loaded down with plush and silk things , bright yellow and green but her oily hair was done up in curls , and she triumphantly rushed into the , accompanied by a tall , smiling man with an face , in a coat with silk facings and a white tie .
this was an author .
he knew nekhludoff by sight .
anatal , she said , opening the door , come here .
semion ivanovitch promised to read to us his poem , and you must read something from garshin .
nekhludoff was preparing to go , but the lawyer wife whispered something to her husband and turned to him i know you , prince , and consider an introduction unnecessary .
you please attend our literary breakfast ?
it will be very interesting .
anatal is an excellent reader .
you see what variety of duties i have , said anatal , smiling and pointing at his wife , thereby expressing the impossibility of resisting that bewitching person .
with a sad and grave face and with the greatest politeness , nekhludoff thanked the lawyer wife for the invitation , pleaded other engagements and went into the .
what faces he makes !
the lawyer wife said of him , when he had left the room .
in the the clerk handed him the petition , and in answer to nekhludoff question about the honorarium , said that anatal semionovitch set his fee at a thousand rubles ; that he really does not take such cases , but does it for nekhludoff .
and who is to sign the petition ?
asked nekhludoff .
the prisoner may sign it herself , and if that be troublesome , she may empower anatal semionovitch .
no , i will go to the prison and obtain her signature , said nekhludoff , rejoicing at the opportunity of seeing katiousha before the appointed day .
at the usual hour the jailers ' whistles were heard in the corridors of the prison ; with a rattling of irons the doors of the corridors and cells opened , and the patter of bare feet and the clatter of prison shoes resounded through the corridors ; the men and women prisoners washed and dressed , and after going through the morning inspection , proceeded to brew their tea .
during the animated conversations were going on among the prisoners in the cells and corridors .
two prisoners were to be flogged that day .
one of these was a fairly intelligent young clerk who , in a fit of jealousy , had killed his mistress .
he was loved by his for his cheerfulness , liberality and firmness in dealing with the authorities .
he knew the laws and demanded compliance with them .
three weeks ago the warden struck one of the chambermen for spilling some soup on his new uniform .
the clerk , vasilieff , took the chamberman part , saying that there was no law permitting an official to beat prisoners .
i will show you the law , said the warden , reviling vasilieff .
the latter answered in kind .
the warden was about to strike him , but vasilieff caught hold of his hands and held him fast for about three minutes and then pushed him out of the door .
the warden complained and the inspector ordered vasilieff placed in solitary confinement .
these cells for solitary confinement were dark closets from the outside .
in these cold , damp cells , devoid of bed , table or chair , the prisoners were obliged to sit or lie on the dirty floor .
the rats , of which there was a large number , crawled all over them , and were so bold that they devoured the prisoner bread and often attacked the prisoners themselves when they remained motionless .
vasilieff resisted , and with the aid of two other prisoners , tore himself loose from the jailers , but they were finally overcome and all three were thrust into cells .
it was reported to the governor that something like a mutiny occurred , and in answer came a document ordering that the two chief culprits , vasilieff and the tramp ( an application given to some tramps and jail birds who , to conceal the identity , with characteristic ingenuity and stupidity make that answer to all questions relating to their names ) , be given thirty lashes each .
the flogging was to take place in the women .
this was known to all the inmates of the prison since the previous evening , and every one was talking of the coming flogging .
korableva , miss dandy , theodosia and maslova , flushed and animated , for they had already partaken of vodka which maslova now had in abundance , were sitting in their corner , talking of the same thing .
why , he has not misbehaved , korableva said of vasilieff , biting off a piece of sugar with her strong teeth .
he only sided with a comrade .
fighting , you know , is not allowed nowadays .
they say he is a fine fellow , added theodosia , who was sitting on a log on which stood a .
if you were to tell him , michaelovna , the said to maslova , meaning nekhludoff .
i will .
he will do anything for me , maslova answered , smiling and shaking her head .
it will be too late ; they are going to fetch him now , said theodosia .
it is awful , she added , sighing .
i have seen once a peasant flogged in the town hall .
my had sent me to the mayor of the borough , and when i came there i was surprised to see him the began a long story .
her story was interrupted by voices and steps on the upper corridor .
the women became silent , listening .
they are bringing him , the fiends , said miss dandy .
wo he get it now !
the jailers are very angry , for he gave them no rest .
it became quiet in the upper corridor , and the finished her story , how she was frightened when she saw the peasant flogged , and how it turned her stomach .
miss dandy told how schezloff was flogged with a lash while he never uttered a word .
theodosia then removed the pots and bowls ; korableva and the took to their sewing , while maslova , hugging her knees , became sad from ennui .
she was about to lay down to sleep when the matron called her into the office , where a visitor was waiting for her .
do fail to tell him about us , said the old menshova , while maslova was arranging her headgear before a half void of mercury .
it was not me who set the fire , but he , the villain , himself did it , and the laborer saw it .
he would not kill a man .
tell him to call dmitry .
dmitry will explain to him everything .
they locked us up here for nothing , while the villain is living with another man wife and sits around in .
that wrong !
affirmed korableva .
i will tell him yes , i will , answered maslova .
suppose we have a drink , for courage ?
she added , winking one eye .
korableva poured out half a cup for her .
maslova drank it and wiped her mouth .
her spirits rose , and repeating the words for courage , shaking her head and smiling , she followed the matron .
nekhludoff had been waiting for a long time in the vestibule .
arriving at the prison he rang the bell and handed his pass to the warden on duty .
what do you want ?
i wish to see the prisoner maslova .
ca see her now ; the inspector is busy .
in the office ?
asked nekhludoff .
no , here in the visitors ' room , the warden answered , somewhat embarrassed , as it seemed to nekhludoff .
why , are visitors admitted ?
no special business , he answered .
where can i see him , then ?
he will come out presently .
wait .
at that moment a in bright uniform , his face radiant , and his mustache impregnated with smoke , appeared from a side door .
why did you admit him here ?
what is the office for ?
he said sternly , turning to the warden .
i was told that the inspector was here , said nekhludoff , surprised at the embarrassment noticeable on the officer face .
at that moment the inner door opened and petroff , flushed and perspiring , came out .
he will remember it , he said , turning to the .
the latter pointed with his eyes to nekhludoff , and petroff became silent , frowned and walked out through the rear door .
who will remember ?
what ?
why are they all so embarrassed ?
why did the sergeant make that sign ?
thought nekhludoff .
you can not wait here ; please walk into the office , the turned to nekhludoff , who was about to go out when the inspector came in through the inner door , more embarrassed even than his assistants .
he was sighing incessantly .
seeing nekhludoff , he turned to the warden fedotoff , call maslova .
follow me , please , he said to nekhludoff .
they passed up a winding stairway leading into a small room with one window and containing a writing table and a few chairs .
the inspector sat down .
mine are disagreeable duties , he said , turning to nekhludoff and lighting a thick cigarette .
you seem tired , said nekhludoff .
i am very tired of all this business ; my duties are very onerous .
i am trying my best to alleviate the condition of the prisoners and things are getting only worse .
i am very anxious to get away from here ; the duties are very , very unpleasant .
nekhludoff could not understand what it was that made it so unpleasant for the inspector , but he noticed on the inspector face an expression of despondency and hopelessness which was pitiful to behold .
yes , i think they are very trying , he said .
but why do you not resign ?
i have a family and am without means .
but if it is difficult well , you see , i manage to improve somewhat their lot after all .
another one in my place would hardly exert himself as i do .
it is no easy matter to handle two thousand people .
they are also human and one feels pity for them , and yet they ca be allowed to have all their own way .
and the inspector related the case of a recent fight among the prisoners which ended in murder .
his story was interrupted by the entrance of maslova , who was preceded by the warden .
nekhludoff got sight of her when she appeared on the threshold and before she saw the inspector .
her face was red , and she walked briskly behind the warden , smiling and shaking her head .
noticing the inspector she gazed at him with frightened face , but immediately recovered herself and boldly and cheerfully turned to nekhludoff .
how do you do ?
she said , drawlingly , smiling and vigorously shaking his hand , not as on the former occasion .
here i have brought you the petition to sign , said nekhludoff , somewhat surprised at the forward manner in which she accosted him .
the lawyer wrote it .
it must be signed and sent to st .
petersburg .
why , certainly .
i will do anything , she said , winking one eye and smiling .
may she sign it here ?
nekhludoff asked of the inspector .
come here and sit down , said the inspector .
here is a pen for you .
can you write ?
i could write once , she said , smiling , and , arranging her skirt and , sat down , clumsily took the pen into her small , energetic hand , began to laugh and looked round at nekhludoff .
he pointed out to her where to sign .
diligently dipping and shaking the pen she signed her name .
do you wish anything else ?
she asked , looking now at nekhludoff , now at the inspector , and depositing the pen now on the , now on the paper .
i wish to tell you something , said nekhludoff , taking the pen from her hand .
very well ; go on , she uttered , and suddenly , as though meditating or growing sleepy , her face became grave .
the inspector rose and walked out , leaving nekhludoff with her alone .
the warden who brought maslova to the office seated himself on the , away from the table .
this was a decisive moment for nekhludoff .
he had been constantly reproaching himself for not telling her at their first meeting of his intention to marry her , and was now determined to do so .
she was sitting on one side of the table , and nekhludoff seated himself on the other side , opposite her .
the room was well lighted , and for the first time nekhludoff clearly saw her face from a short distance , and noticed wrinkles around the eyes and lips and a slight swelling under her eyes , and he pitied her even more than before .
resting his elbows on the table so that he should not be heard by the warden , whose face was of a jewish type , with grayish , he said if this petition fails we will appeal to his majesty .
nothing will be left undone .
if it had been done before if i had had a good lawyer she interrupted him .
that lawyer of mine was such a little fool .
he was only making me compliments , she said , and began to laugh .
if they had only known that i was your acquaintance , it would have been different .
they think that everybody is a thief .
how strange she is , thought nekhludoff , and was about to tell her what he had on his mind when she again began to speak .
i wanted to tell you .
there is an old woman here we are even surprised such a good little woman , but there she is she and her son , both in prison , and everybody knows that they are innocent .
they are accused of setting fire , so they are in prison .
she learned , you know , that i am acquainted with you , said maslova , turning her head and casting glances at him , and she says to me him , ' she says , call my son ; he will tell him the whole story . '
menshoff is his name .
well , will you do it ?
such a good little woman .
you can see for yourself that she is not guilty .
you will help them , dear , wo you ?
she said , glancing at him ; then she lowered her eyes and smiled .
very well ; i will do it , said nekhludoff , his surprise at her easy manner growing , but i would like to talk to you about my own affair .
do you remember what i told you that time ?
you have spoken so much .
what did you say that time ?
she said , continuing to smile and turning her head now to one side , now to the other .
i said that i came to ask your forgiveness , he said .
oh !
forgiveness , forgiveness !
that is all nonsense .
you had better that i wish to atone for my sin , continued nekhludoff , and to atone not by words but by deed .
i have decided to marry you .
her face suddenly showed fright .
her squinting eyes became fixed , and they looked and did not look at him .
what is that for ?
and she frowned maliciously .
i feel that before god i must do it .
what god , now , are you talking about ?
you are not talking to the point .
god ?
what god ?
why did you think of god then ?
she said , and opening her mouth , stopped short .
nekhludoff only now smelled a strong odor of liquor and understood the cause of her excitement .
be calm , he said .
i have nothing to be calm about .
you think i am drunk ?
yes , i am drunk , but i know what i am talking about , she said quickly , and her face became purple .
i am a convict , while you are a lord , a prince , and need stay here to soil your hands .
go to your princesses you can not be too cruel to me ; you do not know how i feel , he said in a low voice , his whole body trembling .
you can not imagine how strongly i feel my guilt before you !
feel my guilt , she mocked him maliciously .
you did not feel it then , but thrust a hundred rubles in my hands .
your price ' i know , i know , but what am i to do now ?
i have decided not to leave you , he repeated ; and what i say i will do .
and i say that you will not !
she said , and laughed aloud .
katinsha !
he began .
leave me .
i am a convict , and you are a prince ; and you have no business here , she shrieked , violently releasing her hand from his , her wrath knowing no limit .
you wish to save yourself through me , she continued , hastening to pour out all that had accumulated in her soul .
you have made me the means of your enjoyment in life , and now you wish to make me the means of saving you after death !
you disgust me , as do your and that fat , dirty face of yours .
go , go away !
she shrieked , energetically springing to her feet .
the warden approached them .
do you make so much noise !
you know whom please desist , said nekhludoff .
she must not forget herself , said the warden .
please wait a while , said nekhludoff .
the warden returned to his seat on the .
maslova again seated herself , her eyes downcast and her little hands clutching each other .
nekhludoff stood over her , not knowing what to do .
you do not believe me , he said .
that you wish to marry me ?
that will never happen .
i will sooner hang myself .
but i will serve you anyway .
that is your business .
only i do want anything from you .
now , that is certain , she said .
oh , why did i not die then !
she added , and began to cry piteously .
nekhludoff could not speak ; her tears called forth tears in his own eyes .
she raised her eyes , looked at him , as if surprised , and with her began to wipe the tears streaming down her cheeks .
the warden again approached them and reminded them that it was time to part .
maslova rose .
you are excited now .
if possible i will call .
meantime , think it over , said nekhludoff .
she made no answer , and without looking at him left the room , preceded by the warden .
well , girl , good times are coming , said korableva to maslova when the latter returned to the cell .
he seems to be stuck on you , so make the most of it while he is calling .
he will get you released .
the rich can do anything .
that so , drawled the .
the poor man will think ten times before he will marry , while the rich man can satisfy his every whim .
yes , my dear ; there was a respectable man in our village , and he have you spoken to him of my case ?
asked the old woman .
but maslova was silent .
she lay down on her bunk , gazing with her squinting eyes into the corner , and remained in that position till evening .
her soul was in torment .
that which nekhludoff told her opened to her that world in which she had suffered and which she had left , hating without understanding it .
she had now lost that forgetfulness in which she had lived , and to live with a clear recollection of the past was painful .
in the evening she again bought wine , which she drank with her .
so , that is how it is !
thought nekhludoff as he made his way out of the prison , and he only now realized the extent of his guilt .
had he not attempted to efface and atone for his conduct , he should never have felt all the infamy of it , nor she all the wrong perpetrated against her .
only now it all came out in all its horror .
he now for the first time perceived how her soul had been debased , and she finally understood it .
at first nekhludoff had played with his feelings and delighted in his own contrition ; now he was simply horrified .
he now felt that to abandon her was impossible .
and yet he could not see the result of these relations .
at the prison gate some one handed nekhludoff a note .
he read it when on the street .
the note was written in a bold hand , with pencil , and contained the following having learned that you are visiting the prison i thought it would be well to see you .
you can see me by asking the authorities for an interview with me .
i will tell you something very important to your protege as well as to the politicals .
thankfully , vera bogodukhovskaia bogodukhovskaia !
who is bogodukhovskaia ?
thought nekhludoff , entirely absorbed in the impression of his meeting with maslova , and failing at the first moment to recall either the name or the handwriting .
oh , yes !
he suddenly recalled .
the deacon daughter at the .
vera bogodukhovskaia was a teacher in the obscure district of novgorod , whither nekhludoff , on one occasion , went bear hunting with his friends .
this teacher had asked nekhludoff to give her some money to enable her to study .
he gave it to her , and the incident dropped from his memory .
and now it seemed that this lady was a political prisoner , had probably learned his history in prison , and was now offering her services .
at that time everything was easy and simple ; now everything was difficult and complex .
nekhludoff readily and joyfully recalled that time and his acquaintance with bogodukhovskaia .
it was on the eve of shrovetide , in the wilds about sixty versts from the railroad .
the hunt was successful ; two bears were bagged , and they were dining before their journey home , when the woodsman , in whose hut they were stopping , came to tell them that the deacon daughter had come and wished to see prince nekhludoff .
is she good looking ?
some one asked .
come , come !
said nekhludoff , rising , and wondering why the daughter should want him , assumed a grave expression and went to the woodsman hut .
in the hut there was a girl in a felt hat and short fur coat , sinewy , and with an ugly and unpleasant face , relieved , however , by her pleasant eyes and raised eyebrows .
this is the prince , vera efremovna , said the old hostess .
i will leave you .
what can i do for you ?
asked nekhludoff .
i i you see , you are rich and throw away your money on trifles , on a chase .
i know , began the girl , becoming confused , but i wish but one thing ; i wish to be useful to people , and can do nothing because i know nothing .
what , then , can i do for you ?
i am a teacher , and would like to enter college , but they do let me .
it is not exactly that they do let me , but we have no means .
let me have some money ; when i am through with my studies i shall return it to you .
her eyes were truthful and kindly , and the expression of resolution and timidity on her face was so touching that nekhludoff , as it was usual with him , suddenly mentally placed himself in her position , understood and pitied her .
i think it is wrong for rich people to kill bears and get the peasants drunk .
why do they make themselves useful ?
i only need eighty rubles .
oh , if you do wish to , it is all the same to me , she said , angrily , interpreting the grave expression on face to her disadvantage .
on the contrary , i am very thankful to you for the opportunity when she understood that he consented her face turned a purple color and she became silent .
i will fetch it immediately , said nekhludoff .
he went into the entrance hall where he found an eavesdropping friend .
without taking notice of his comrade jests , he took the money from his and brought it to her .
please do be thanking me .
it is i who ought to be thankful to you .
it was pleasant to nekhludoff to recall all that ; it was pleasant to recall how he came near quarreling with the army officer who attempted to make a bad joke of it ; how another comrade sided with him , which drew them more closely together ; how merry and successful was the hunt , and how happy he felt that night returning to the railroad station .
a long file of sleighs moved noiselessly in pairs at a gentle trot along the narrow path of the forests , which were covered with a heavy layer of snowflakes .
some one struck a red light in the dark , and the pleasant aroma of a good cigarette was wafted toward him .
osip , the , ran from sleigh to sleigh , in snow , telling of the elks that were roaming in the deep snow , nibbling the bark of aspen trees , and of the bears emitting their warm breath through the airholes of their wild haunts .
nekhludoff remembered all that , and above all the happy consciousness of his own health , strength and freedom from care .
his lungs , straining his fur coat , inhaled the frosty air ; the trees , grazed by the shaft , sent showers of white flakes into his face ; his body was warm , his face ruddy ; his soul was without a care or blemish , or fear or desire .
how happy he was !
but now ?
my god !
how painful and unbearable it all was !
rising the next morning nekhludoff recalled the events of the previous day and was seized with fear .
but , notwithstanding this fear , he was even more determined than before to carry out his plan already begun .
with this consciousness of the duty that lay upon him he drove to maslenikoff for permission to visit in jail , besides maslova , the old woman menshova and her son , of whom maslova had spoken to him .
besides , he also wished to see bogodukhovskaia , who might be useful to maslova .
nekhludoff had known maslenikoff since they together served in the army .
maslenikoff was the treasurer of the regiment .
he was the most officer , and possessed executive ability .
nothing in society was of any interest to him , and he was entirely absorbed in the affairs of the regiment .
nekhludoff now found him an administrator in the civil government .
he was married to a rich and energetic woman to whom was due his change of occupation .
she laughed at him and patted him as she would a tamed animal .
nekhludoff had visited them once the previous winter , but the couple seemed so uninteresting to him that he never called again .
maslenikoff face became radiant when he saw nekhludoff .
his face was as fat and red , his dress as excellent as when he served in the army .
as an army officer he was always neat , dressed in a tight uniform made according to the latest style ; now his dress fitted his body as perfectly .
he wore a uniform .
notwithstanding the difference in their age maslenikoff was about forty they familiarly thoued each other .
very glad you remembered me .
come to my wife .
i have just ten minutes to spare , and then i must to the session .
my chief , you know , is away .
i am directing the affairs of the district , he said , with joy which he could not conceal .
i came to you on business .
what that ?
maslenikoff said in a frightened and somewhat stern voice , suddenly pricking his ears .
there is a person in jail in whom i am very much interested ; at the word jail maslenikoff face became even more stern , and i would like to have the right of interview in the office instead of the common reception room , and oftener than on the appointed days .
i was told that it depended on you .
of course , mon cher , i am always ready to do anything for you , maslenikoff said , touching his knees with both hands , as if desiring to soften his own greatness .
i can do it , but you know i am caliph only for an hour .
so you can give me a pass that will enable me to see her ?
it is a woman ?
yes .
what is the charge against her ?
poisoning .
but she was irregularly convicted .
yes , there is justice for you !
ils font point , he said , for some reason in french .
i know that you do not agree with me , but mon opinion bien arretee , he added , repeating the opinion that had been reiterated during the past year by a retrograde , conservative newspaper .
i know you are a liberal .
i do know whether i am a liberal or something else , smilingly said nekhludoff , who always wondered at being joined to some party , or called a liberal only because he held that a man must not be judged without being heard ; that all are equal before the law ; that it is wrong to torture and beat people generally , especially those that are not convicted .
i do know whether i am a liberal or not , but i do know that our present courts , bad as they are , are nevertheless better than those that preceded them .
and what lawyer have you retained ?
i have retained fanarin .
ah , fanarin !
maslenikoff said , frowning as he recalled how fanarin , examining him as a witness the year before , in the most polite manner made him the butt of ridicule .
i would not advise you to have anything to do with him .
fanarin est un homme tare .
i have another request to make of you , nekhludoff said , without answering him .
a long time ago i made the acquaintance of a girl teacher , a very wretched creature .
she is now in jail and desires to see me .
can you give me a pass to her ?
maslenikoff leaned his head to one side and began to reflect .
she is a political .
yes , i was told so .
you know politicals can only be seen by their relatives , but i will give you a general pass .
je sais que vous pas what is the name of this your protege ?
bogodukhovskaia ?
elle est jolie ?
hideuse .
maslenikoff disapprovingly shook his head , went to the table and on a sheet of paper with a printed wrote in a bold hand the bearer , prince dmitri ivanovich nekhludoff , is hereby permitted to visit the prisoners , maslova and bogodukhovskaia , now detained in the prison , and signed his name to it with a broad flourish .
you will see now what order there is in prison .
and to keep order there is very difficult , because it is overcrowded , especially by those to be transported .
but i watch over them , and like the occupation .
you will see there are very many there , but they are content , and are faring well .
it is necessary to know how to deal with them .
some unpleasantness occurred there a few days ago disobedience .
another man in my place would have treated it as a riot and made many people miserable , but we arranged it all pleasantly .
what is necessary is solicitude on the one hand , and prompt and vigorous dealing on the other , he said , clenching his soft , white fist projecting from under a white , starched cuff and adorned with a turquoise ring solicitude and vigorous dealing .
well , i do know about that , said nekhludoff .
i was there twice , and i was very much distressed by the sight .
you know what i will tell you ?
you ought to get acquainted with princess passek , continued maslenikoff , who had become talkative ; she has entirely devoted herself to this cause .
elle fait beaucoup de bien .
thanks to her and , without false modesty , to myself , everything has been changed , and changed so that none of the old horrors can be found there , and they are decidedly well off there .
you will see it .
there is fanarin .
i am not personally acquainted with him ; besides , our roads do not meet because of my position in society , but he is decidedly a bad man , and allows himself to state in court such things , such things !
well , thank you , said nekhludoff , taking the document , and took leave of his old comrade .
would you not like to see my wife ?
no , thank you ; i have no time now .
well , now , she will never forgive me , said maslenikoff , conducting his old comrade to the first landing , as he did with people of secondary importance , among whom he reckoned nekhludoff .
do come but for a moment .
but nekhludoff was firm , and while the footman and porter sprang toward him , handing him his overcoat and cane , and opening the door , before which a policeman stood , he excused himself , pleading want of time .
well , then , thursday , please .
that is her reception day .
i will tell her !
maslenikoff shouted from the top of the stairs .
from maslenikoff , nekhludoff went directly to the prison and approached the familiar apartments of the inspector .
the sounds of a tuneless piano again assailed his ears , but this time it was not a rhapsody that was played , but a study by clementi , and , as before , with unusual force , precision and rapidity .
the servant with a handkerchief around one eye said that the captain was in , and showed nekhludoff into the small , in which was a lounge , a table and a lamp , one side of the shade of which was scorched , standing on a knitted woolen napkin .
the inspector appeared with an expression of sadness and torment on his face .
glad to see you .
what can i do for you ?
he said , buttoning up the middle button of his uniform .
i went to the , and here is my pass , said nekhludoff , handing him the document .
i would like to see maslova .
markova ?
asked the inspector , who could not hear him on account of the music .
maslova .
o , yes !
o , yes !
the inspector rose and approached the door through which roulade was heard .
marusia ; if you would only stop for a little while , he said in a voice which showed that this music was the cross of his life ; i can not hear anything .
the music ceased ; discontented steps were heard , and some one looked through the door .
the inspector , as if relieved by the cessation of the music , lit a thick cigarette of light tobacco and offered one to nekhludoff , which he refused .
can maslova it is not convenient to see maslova , said the inspector .
why ?
it is your own fault , slightly smiling , said the inspector .
prince , you must not give her any money .
if you wish to give her money , leave it with me ; i will keep it for her .
you see , you must have given her money yesterday , for she bought wine it is hard to eradicate that evil and is intoxicated .
in fact , she became unruly .
is it possible ?
why , i even had to employ strict measures , had her transferred to another cell .
she is very tractable , but , please do not give her money .
that is their failing .
nekhludoff quickly recalled the incident of yesterday , and he was seized with fear .
and may i see bogodukhovskaia , the political ?
nekhludoff asked , after some silence .
well , yes , said the inspector .
what are you doing here ?
he turned to a girl who came into the room , walking toward her father , her eyes riveted on nekhludoff .
look out , or you will fall , he said , smiling , as the little girl , walking with her head turned toward nekhludoff , tripped on the carpet and ran to her father .
if she may be seen , i would go now .
oh yes ; she may be seen , of course , said the inspector , embracing the little girl , who was still looking at nekhludoff .
all right the inspector rose and gently turning the girl aside , walked into the vestibule .
he had scarcely donned the overcoat handed him by the girl with the bandaged eye and crossed the threshold when the distinct sounds of clementi roulade broke out .
she was at the conservatory , but there is disorder in that institution .
but she is very gifted , said the inspector , walking down the stairs .
she intends to appear at concerts .
the inspector and nekhludoff neared the prison .
the wicket immediately opened at the approach of the inspector .
the wardens standing to attention followed him with their eyes .
four men with heads half shaved , carrying large vessels , met him in the vestibule , and as they spied him slunk back .
one of them , in a particularly gloomy way , knit his brow , his black eyes flashing fire .
of course , her talent must be perfected ; it can not be neglected .
but in a small apartment it is hard , you know , the inspector continued the conversation without paying any attention to the prisoners , and dragging his tired legs passed into the , followed by nekhludoff .
whom do you wish to see ?
asked the inspector .
bogodukhovskaia .
that is from the tower .
you will have to wait a little , he turned to nekhludoff .
could you let me see , meantime , the prisoners menshov mother and son who are charged with incendiarism ?
that is from cell .
why , yes ; they may be called out .
would you allow me to see the son in his cell ?
it is quieter in the .
but it is interesting to see him there .
interesting !
at that moment a dashing officer , the inspector assistant , appeared at a side door .
conduct the prince to menshov cell no .
, said the inspector to his assistant .
then show him to the office .
and i will call what is her name ?
vera bogodukhovskaia , said nekhludoff .
the inspector assistant was a young officer with dyed mustache , who spread around him the odor of perfume .
follow me , please .
he turned to nekhludoff with a pleasant smile .
does our institution interest you ?
yes .
and i am also interested in that man who , i was told , is innocent .
the assistant shrugged his shoulders .
yes , that may be , he said calmly , courteously admitting the guest into the corridor .
but they also lie often .
walk in , please .
the doors of the cells were open , and some prisoners stood in the corridor .
slightly nodding to the wardens and looking askance at the prisoners , who either pressed against the walls , entered their cells , or , stopping at the doors , stood erect like soldiers , the assistant escorted nekhludoff through one corridor into another , on the left , which was .
this corridor was darker and more than the first .
there was a row of cells on each side , the doors of which were locked .
there was a hole in each door eyelet , so called of about an inch in diameter .
there was no one in this corridor except an old warden with a wrinkled , sad face .
where is menshov cell ?
asked the assistant .
the eighth one on the left .
are these occupied ?
asked nekhludoff .
all but one .
may i look in ?
asked nekhludoff .
if you please , the assistant said with a pleasant smile , and began to make inquiries of the warden .
nekhludoff looked through one of the openings .
a tall young man with a small black beard , clad only in his linen , walked rapidly up and down the floor of his cell .
hearing a rustle at the door , he looked up , frowned , and continued to walk .
nekhludoff looked into the second opening .
his eye met another large , frightened eye .
he hastily moved away .
looking into the third , he saw a man sleeping curled up on a cot , his head covered with his prison coat .
in the fourth cell a , man sat with lowered head , his elbows resting on his knees .
hearing steps , this man raised his head and looked up .
in his face and eyes was an expression of hopeless anguish .
he was apparently unconcerned about who it was that looked into his cell .
whoever it might be , he evidently hoped for no good from any one .
nekhludoff was seized with fear , and he hastened to number menshov cell .
the warden unlocked and opened the door .
a young , muscular man with a long neck , kindly , round eyes and small beard , stood beside his cot , hastily donning his prison coat and , with frightened face , looking at the two men who had entered .
nekhludoff was particularly struck by the kindly , round eyes whose wondering and startled look ran from him to the warden and back .
this gentleman wishes to ask you about your case .
thank you .
yes , i was told about your case , said nekhludoff , going into the depth of the cell and stopping at the barred , dirty window , and would like to hear it from yourself .
menshov also drew near the window and immediately began to relate the particulars of his case at first timidly , from time to time glancing at the warden , then growing bolder and bolder .
and when the warden had left the cell to give some orders , his timidity left him entirely .
judging by his speech and manner , his was a story of a simple , honest peasant , and it seemed very strange to nekhludoff to hear it from the lips of a prisoner in the garb of disgrace and in prison .
while listening to him , nekhludoff examined the low cot , with its straw mattress , the window , with its thick iron bars , the damp , plastered walls , the pitiful face and the figure of the unfortunate , mutilated peasant in bast shoes and prison coat , and he became sad ; he would not believe that what this man told him was true .
and it was still harder to think that this truthful story should be false , and that kindly face should deceive him .
his story , in short , was that soon after his wedding a tapster enticed away his wife .
he had recourse to the law everywhere , and the tapster was everywhere acquitted .
once he took her away by force , but she ran away the following day .
he went to the seducer , demanding his wife .
the tapster told him that she was not there , although he saw her when coming in , and ordered him to depart .
he would not go .
then the tapster and another workman beat him until he bled , and the following day the tapster house took fire .
he and his mother were charged with incendiarism , although at the time the fire broke out he was visiting a friend .
and you really did not set the fire ?
i never even thought of such a thing , master .
the villain must have done it himself .
they say that he had just insured his house .
and he said that i and my mother came and threatened him .
it is true , i abused him at that time could help it but i did not set the fire , and was not even in the neighborhood when the fire started .
he set the fire purposely on the day i was there with my mother .
he did it for the insurance money , and threw it on us .
is it possible ?
as true as there is a living god , master .
do help us !
he was about to bow to the ground , but nekhludoff forcibly prevented him .
release me .
i am suffering here innocently , he continued .
his face suddenly began to twitch ; tears welled up in his eyes , and , rolling up the sleeve of his coat , he began to wipe his eyes with the dirty sleeve of his shirt .
have you finished ?
asked the warden .
yes .
cheer up ; i will do what i can for you , nekhludoff said , and walked out .
menshov stood in the door , so that when the warden closed it he pushed him in .
while the warden was locking the door , menshov looked through the hole .
it was dinner time when nekhludoff retraced his steps through the wide corridor , and the cells were open .
the prisoners , in light yellow coats , short , wide trousers and prison shoes , eyed him greedily .
nekhludoff experienced strange feelings and commiseration for the prisoners , and , for some reason , shame that he should so calmly view it .
in one of the corridors a man , clattering with his prison shoes , ran into one of the cells , and immediately a crowd of people came out , placed themselves in his way , and bowed .
your excellency i do know what to call you please order that our case be decided .
i am not the commander .
i do not know anything .
no matter .
tell them , the authorities , or somebody , said an indignant voice , to look into our case .
we are guilty of no offense , and have been in prison the second month now .
how so ?
why ?
asked nekhludoff .
we do know ourselves why , but we have been here the second month .
that is true , said the assistant inspector .
they were taken because they had no passports , and they were to be transported to their district , but the prison had burned down there , and the authorities asked us to keep them here .
those belonging to other districts were transported , but these we keep here .
is that the only reason ?
asked nekhludoff , stopping in the doorway .
the crowd , consisting of about forty men , all in prison garb , surrounded nekhludoff and the assistant .
several voices began talking at once .
the assistant stopped them .
let one of you speak .
a tall old man of good mien came forward .
he told nekhludoff that they were all imprisoned on the ground that they had no passports , but that , as a matter of fact , they had passports which had expired and were not renewed for about two weeks .
it happened every year , but they were never even fined .
and now they were imprisoned like criminals .
we are all masons and belong to the same association .
they say that the prison has burned down , but that is our fault .
for god sake , help us !
nekhludoff listened , but scarcely understood what the old man was saying .
how is that ?
can it be possible that they are kept in prison for that sole reason ?
said nekhludoff , turning to the assistant .
yes , they ought to be sent to their homes , said the assistant .
at that moment a man , also in prison attire , pushed his way through the crowd and began to complain excitedly that they were being tortured without any cause .
worse than dogs he began .
tut , tut !
do not talk too much , or else you know know what ?
said the little man desperately .
are we guilty of anything ?
silence !
shouted the assistant , and the little man subsided .
what a peculiar state of things !
nekhludoff said to himself as he ran the gauntlet , as it were , of a hundred eyes that followed him through the corridor .
is it possible that innocent people are held in durance here ?
nekhludoff said , when they emerged from the corridor .
what can we do ?
however , many of them are lying .
if you ask them , they all claim to be innocent , said the assistant inspector ; although some are there really without any cause whatever .
but these masons do seem to be guilty of any offense .
that is true so far as the masons are concerned .
but those people are spoiled .
some measure of severity is necessary .
they are not all as innocent as they look .
only yesterday we were obliged to punish two of them .
punish , how ?
asked nekhludoff .
by flogging .
it was ordered but corporal punishment has been abolished .
not for those that have been deprived of civil rights .
nekhludoff recalled what he had seen the other day while waiting in the vestibule , and understood that the punishment had then been taking place , and with peculiar force came upon him that mingled feeling of curiosity , sadness , doubt , and moral , almost passing over into physical , nausea which he had felt before , but never with such force .
without listening to the assistant or looking around him , he hastily passed through the corridor and ascended to the office .
the inspector was in the corridor , and , busying himself with some affair , had forgot to send for bogodukhovskaia .
he only called it to mind when nekhludoff entered the office .
i will send for her immediately .
take a seat , he said .
the office consisted of two rooms .
in the first room , which had two dirty windows and the plastering on the walls peeled off , a black measuring rod , for determining the height of prisoners , stood in one corner , while in another hung a picture of christ .
a few wardens stood around in this room .
in the second room , in groups and pairs , about twenty men and women were sitting along the walls , talking in low voices .
a writing table stood near one of the windows .
the inspector seated himself at the writing table and offered nekhludoff a chair standing near by .
nekhludoff seated himself and began to examine the people in the room .
his attention was first of all attracted by a young man with a pleasant face , wearing a short jacket , who was standing before a man prisoner and a girl , gesticulating and talking to them in a heated manner .
beside them sat an old man in blue , immovably holding the hand of a woman in prison garb and listening to her .
a boy in uniform , with an expression of fright on his face , stood gazing on the old man .
not far from them , in the corner , a pair of lovers were sitting .
she was a very young , pretty , girl with , flaxen hair and an energetic face ; he was a , handsome youth , with wavy hair , and in a prison coat .
they occupied the corner , whispering to each other , apparently wrapped in their love .
nearest of all to the table was a woman in black , evidently the mother of a consumptive young man in a rubber jacket , who stood before her .
her eyes were fixed on him , and her tears prevented her speaking , which she several times attempted to do , but was forced to desist .
the young man held a piece of paper in his hand , and , evidently not knowing what to do , with an angry expression on his face was folding and crumpling it .
sitting beside the weeping mother , and patting her on the shoulder , was a stout , pretty girl with red cheeks , in a gray dress and cape .
everything in this girl was beautiful the white hands , the wavy , short hair , the strong nose and lips ; but the principal charm of her face were her hazel , kindly , truthful , sheep eyes .
her beautiful eyes turned on nekhludoff at the moment he entered , and met his .
but she immediately turned them again on her mother , and whispered to her something .
not far from the lovers a dark man with gloomy face sat talking angrily to a visitor resembling a skopetz ( a sect of castrates ) .
at the very door stood a young man in a rubber jacket , evidently more concerned about the impression he was making on the visitors than what he was saying .
nekhludoff sat down beside the inspector and looked around him with intense curiosity .
he was amused by a boy coming near him and asking him in a shrill voice and whom are you waiting for ?
the question surprised nekhludoff , but , seeing the boy serious , intelligent face , with bright , attentive eyes , gravely answered that he was awaiting a woman acquaintance .
well , is she your sister ?
asked the boy .
no , she is not my sister , nekhludoff answered with surprise .
and with whom are you ?
i am with mamma .
she is a political , said the boy .
maria pavlovna , take away kolia !
said the inspector , evidently finding nekhludoff conversation with the boy contrary to the law .
maria pavlovna , the same beautiful woman who had attracted nekhludoff attention , rose and with heavy , long strides approached him .
what is he asking you ?
who you are ?
she asked , slightly smiling with her beautifully curved lips , and confidingly looking at him with her prominent , kindly eyes , as though expecting nekhludoff to know that her relations to everybody always have been , are and ought to be simple , affable , and brotherly .
he must know everything , she said , and smiled into the face of the boy with such a kindly , charming smile that both the boy and nekhludoff involuntarily also smiled .
yes , he asked me whom i came to see .
maria pavlovna , you know that it is not permitted to speak to strangers , said the inspector .
all right , she said , and , taking the little hand of the boy into her own white hand , she returned to the consumptive mother .
whose boy is that ?
nekhludoff asked the inspector .
he is the son of a political prisoner , and was born in prison .
is it possible ?
yes , and now he is following his mother to siberia .
and that girl ?
i can not answer it , said the inspector , shrugging his shoulders .
ah , there is bogodukhovskaia .
the , lean , vera efremovna , with her large , kindly eyes , entered timidly through the rear door .
well , i thank you for coming here , she said , pressing hand .
you remember me ?
let us sit down .
i did not expect to find you here .
oh , i am doing excellently so well , indeed , that i desire nothing better , said vera efremovna , looking frightened , as usual , with her kindly , round eyes at nekhludoff , and turning her very thin , sinewy neck , which projected from under the crumpled , dirty collar of her waist .
nekhludoff asked her how she came to be in prison .
she related her case to him with great animation .
her discourse was interspersed with foreign scientific terms about propaganda , disorganization , groups , sections and , which , she was perfectly certain , everybody knew , but of which nekhludoff had never even heard .
she was evidently sure that it was both interesting and pleasant to him to know all that she was relating .
nekhludoff , however , looked at her pitiful neck , her thin , tangled hair , and wondered why she was telling him all that .
he pitied her , but not as he pitied the peasant menshov with his hands and face white as potato sprouts , and innocently languishing in an prison .
he pitied her on account of the evident confusion that reigned in her head .
she seemed to consider herself a heroine , and showed off before him .
and this made her particularly pitiful .
this trait nekhludoff noticed in other people then in the room .
his arrival attracted their attention , and he felt that they changed their demeanor because of his presence .
this trait was also present in the young man in the rubber jacket , in the woman in prison clothes , and even in the actions of the two lovers .
the only people who did not possess this trait were the consumptive young man , the beautiful girl with sheep eyes , and the man who was talking to the beardless man who resembled a skopetz .
the affair of which vera efremovna wished to speak to nekhludoff consisted of the following a chum of hers , shustova , who did not even belong to her , was arrested because in her dwelling were found books and papers which had been left with her for safe keeping .
vera efremovna thought that it was partly her fault that shustova was imprisoned , and implored nekhludoff , who was well connected , to do everything in his power to effect her release .
of herself , she related that , after having graduated as midwife , she joined some party .
at first everything went on smoothly , but afterward one of the party was caught , the papers were seized , and then all were taken in a police .
they also took me , and now i am going to be transported , she wound up her story .
but that is nothing .
i feel excellently , and she smiled piteously .
nekhludoff asked her about the girl with the sheep eyes , and vera efremovna told him that she was the daughter of a general , that she had assumed the guilt of another person , and was now going to serve at hard labor in siberia .
an altruistic , honest person , said vera efremovna .
the other case of which vera efremovna wished to speak concerned maslova .
as the history of every prisoner was known to everyone in prison , she knew maslova history , and advised him to procure her removal to the ward for politicals , or , at least , to the hospital , which was just now crowded , requiring a larger staff of nurses .
nekhludoff said that he could hardly do anything , but promised to make an attempt when he reached petersburg .
their conversation was interrupted by the inspector , who announced that it was time to depart .
nekhludoff rose , took leave of vera efremovna , and strode to the door , where he stopped to observe what was taking place before him .
ladies and gentlemen , the time is up , said the inspector as he was going out .
but neither visitors nor prisoners stirred .
the inspector demand only called forth greater animation , but no one thought of departing .
some got up and talked standing ; some continued to talk sitting ; others began to cry and take leave .
the young man continued to crumple the bit of paper , and he made such a good effort to remain calm that his face seemed to bear an angry expression .
his mother , hearing that the visit was over , fell on his shoulder and began to sob .
the girl with the sheep eyes nekhludoff involuntarily followed her movements stood before the sobbing mother , pouring words of consolation into her ear .
the old man with the blue held his daughter by the hand and nodded affirmatively to her words .
the young lovers rose , holding each other hands and silently looking into each other eyes .
those are the only happy people here , said the young man in the rubber jacket who stood near nekhludoff , pointing to the young lovers .
seeing the glances of nekhludoff and the young man , the lovers the convict and the girl stretched their clasping hands , threw back their heads , and began to dance in a circle .
they will be married this evening in the prison , and she will go with him to siberia , said the young man .
who is he , then ?
he is a penal convict .
although they are making merry , it is very painful to listen , added the young man , listening to the sobbing of the old man with the blue .
please , please do compel me to take severe measures , said the inspector , several times repeating the same thing .
please , please , he said , weakly and irresolutely .
well , now , this can not go on .
please , now come .
for the last time i repeat it , he said , in a sad voice , seating himself and rising again ; lighting and then extinguishing his cigarette .
finally the prisoners and visitors began to depart the former passing through the inner , the latter through the outer , door .
first the man in the rubber coat passed out ; then the consumptive and the convict ; next vera efremovna and maria pavlovna , and the boy who was born in the prison .
the visitors also filed out .
the old man with the blue started with a heavy gait , and after him came nekhludoff .
what a peculiar state of things !
said the talkative young man to nekhludoff on the stairs , as though continuing the interrupted conversation .
it is fortunate that the captain is a man , and does not enforce the rules .
but for him it would be tantalizing .
as it is , they talk together and relieve their feelings .
when nekhludoff , talking to this man , who gave his name as medyntzev , reached the , the inspector , with weary countenance , approached him .
so , if you wish to see maslova , then please call , he said , evidently desiring to be pleasant .
very well , said nekhludoff , and hastened away .
as on the former occasion , besides pity he was seized with a feeling of doubt and a sort of moral nausea .
what is all that for ?
he asked himself , but found no answer .
on the following day nekhludoff drove to the lawyer and told him of the menshovs ' case , asking him to take up their defense .
the lawyer listened to him attentively , and said that if the facts were really as told to nekhludoff , he would undertake their defense without compensation .
nekhludoff also told him of the hundred and thirty men kept in prison through some misunderstanding , and asked him whose fault he thought it was .
the lawyer was silent for a short while , evidently desiring to give an accurate answer .
whose fault it is ?
no one , he said decisively .
if you ask the prosecutor , he will tell you that it is maslenikoff fault , and if you ask maslenikoff , he will tell you that it is the fault .
it is no one fault .
i will go to maslenikoff and tell him .
that is useless , the lawyer retorted , smiling .
he is he is not your friend or relative , is he ?
he is such a blockhead , and , saving your presence , at the same time such a sly beast !
nekhludoff recalled what maslenikoff had said about the lawyer , made no answer , and , taking leave , directed his steps toward residence .
two things nekhludoff wanted of maslenikoff .
first , to obtain maslova transfer to the hospital , and to help , if possible , the hundred and thirty unfortunates .
although it was hard for him to be dealing with this man , and especially to ask favors of him , yet it was the only way of gaining his end , and he had to go through it .
as nekhludoff approached maslenikoff house , he saw a number of carriages , cabs and traps standing in front of it , and he recalled that this was the reception day to which he had been invited .
while nekhludoff was approaching the house a carriage was standing near the curb , opposite the door , and a lackey in a cockaded silk hat and cape , was seating a lady , who , raising the long train of her skirt , displayed the sharp joints of her toes through the thin slippers .
among the carriages he recognized the covered landau of the korchagins .
the , driver deferentially raised his hat .
nekhludoff had scarcely asked the porter where michael ivanovich ( maslenikoff ) was , when the latter appeared on the carpeted stairway , escorting a very important guest , such as he usually escorted not to the upper landing , but to the vestibule .
this very important military guest , while descending the stairs , was conversing in french about a lottery for the benefit of orphan asylums , giving his opinion that it was a good occupation for ladies .
they enjoy themselves while they are raising money .
et que le bon dieu les bénisse .
ah , nekhludoff , how do you do ?
you have shown yourself for a long time , he greeted nekhludoff .
allez présenter vos devoirs à madame .
the korchagins are here , too .
toutes les jolies femmes de la ville , he said , holding out and somewhat raising his military shoulders for his overcoat , which was being placed on him by his own magnificent lackey in uniform .
au revoir , mon cher .
then he shook maslenikoff hand .
well , now let us go upstairs .
how glad i am , maslenikoff began excitedly , seizing nekhludoff by the arm , and , notwithstanding his corpulence , nimbly leading him up the stairs .
maslenikoff was in a particularly happy mood , which nekhludoff could not help ascribing to the attention shown him by the important person .
every attention shown him by an important person put him into such an ecstasy as may be observed in a fawning little dog when its master pats it , strokes it , and scratches under its ears .
it wags its tail , shrinks , wriggles , and , straightening its ears , madly runs in a circle .
maslenikoff was ready to do the same thing .
he did not notice the grave expression on nekhludoff face , nor hear what he was saying , but irresistibly dragged him into the .
nekhludoff involuntarily followed .
business afterward .
i will do anything you wish , said maslenikoff , leading him through the parlor .
announce prince nekhludoff to her excellency , he said on the way to a lackey .
the lackey , in an ambling gait , ran ahead of them .
vous qu ' à ordonner .
but you must see my wife without fail .
she would not forgive my failure to present you last time you were here .
the lackey had already announced him when they entered , and anna ignatievna , the general , as she called herself sat on a couch surrounded by ladies .
as nekhludoff approached she was already leaning forward with a radiant smile on her face .
at the other end of the women sat around a table , while men in military uniforms and civil attire stood over them .
an incessant cackle came from that direction .
enfin !
why do you estrange yourself ?
have we offended you in any way ?
with these words , presupposing an intimacy between her and nekhludoff , which never existed , anna ignatievna greeted him .
are you acquainted ?
madam beliavskaia michael ivanovich chernoff .
take a seat here .
missy , venez donc à notre table .
on vous opportera votre thé .
and you , she turned to the officer who was conversing with missy , evidently forgetting his name , come here , please .
will you have some tea , prince ?
no , no ; i will never agree with you .
she simply did not love him , said a woman voice .
but she loved pie .
eternally those stupid jests , laughingly interfered another lady in a high hat and dazzling with gold and diamonds .
excellent , these waffles , and so light !
let us have some more .
well , how soon are you going to leave us ?
yes , this is the last day .
that is why we came here .
such a beautiful spring !
how pleasant it is in the country !
missy in her hat and some dark , striped dress which clasped her waist without a wrinkle , was very pretty .
she blushed when she saw nekhludoff .
i thought you had left the city , she said to him .
almost .
business keeps me here .
i come here also for business .
call on mamma .
she is very anxious to see you , she said , and , feeling that she was lying , and that he understood it , her face turned a still deeper purple .
i shall hardly have the time , gloomily answered nekhludoff , pretending not to see that she was blushing .
missy frowned angrily , shrugged her shoulders , and turned to an elegant officer , who took from her hands the empty teacup and valiantly carried it to another table , his sword striking every object it encountered .
you must also contribute toward the asylum .
i am not refusing , only i wish to keep my contribution for the lottery .
there i will show all my liberality .
do forget , now , a plainly dissimulating laugh was heard .
the reception day was brilliant , and anna ignatievna was delighted .
mika told me that you busy yourself in the prisons .
i understand it very well , she said to nekhludoff .
mika she meant her stout husband , maslenikoff may have his faults , but you know that he is kind .
all these unfortunate prisoners are his children .
he does not look on them in any other light .
il est bonté she stopped , not finding words to express bonté of a husband , and immediately , smiling , turned to an old , wrinkled woman in bows who had just entered .
having talked as much and as meaninglessly as it was necessary to preserve the decorum , nekhludoff arose and went over to maslenikoff .
will you please hear me now ?
ah !
yes .
well , what is it ?
come in here .
they entered a small japanese cabinet and seated themselves near the window .
well , je suis à vous .
will you smoke a cigarette ?
but wait ; we must not soil the things here , and he brought an .
well ?
i want two things of you .
is that so ?
maslenikoff face became gloomy and despondent .
all traces of that animation of the little dog whom its master had scratched under the ears entirely disappeared .
voices came from the .
one , a woman voice , said jamais , jamais je ne croirais ; another , a voice from the other corner , was telling something , constantly repeating la comtesse vorouzoff and victor apraksine .
from the third side only a humming noise mingled with laughter was heard .
maslenikoff listened to the voices ; so did nekhludoff .
i want to talk to you again about that woman .
yes ; who was innocently condemned .
i know , i know .
i would like her to be transferred to the hospital .
i was told that it can be done .
maslenikoff pursed up his lips and began to meditate .
it can hardly be done , he said .
however , i will consult about it , and will wire you .
i was told that there are many sick people in the hospital , and they need assistants .
well , yes .
but i will let you know , as i said .
please do , said nekhludoff .
there was a burst of general and even natural laughter in the .
that is caused by victor , said maslenikoff , smiling .
he is remarkably witty when in high spirits .
another thing , said nekhludoff .
there are a hundred and thirty men languishing in prison for the only reason that their passports were not renewed in time .
they have been in prison now for a month .
and he related the causes that kept them there .
how did you come to know it ?
asked nekhludoff , and his face showed disquietude and displeasure .
i was visiting a prisoner , and these people surrounded me and asked what prisoner were you visiting ?
the peasant who is innocently accused , and for whom i have obtained counsel .
but that is not to the point .
is it possible that these innocent people are kept in prison only because they failed to renew their passports ?
that is the prosecutor business , interrupted maslenikoff , somewhat vexed .
now , you say that trials must be speedy and just .
it is the duty of the assistant prosecutor to visit the prisons and see that no one is innocently kept there .
but these assistants do nothing but play cards .
so you can do nothing for them ?
nekhludoff asked gloomily , recalling the words of the lawyer , that the governor would shift the responsibility .
i will see to it .
i will make inquiries immediately .
so much the worse for her .
un , came from the , the voice of a woman apparently entirely indifferent to what she was saying .
so much the better ; i will take this , from the other side was heard a man playful voice , and the merry laughter of a woman who refused him something .
no , no , for no consideration , said a woman voice .
well , then , i will do everything , repeated maslenikoff , extinguishing the cigarette with his white hand , on which was a turquoise ring .
now , let us go to the ladies .
and yet another question , said nekhludoff , without going into the , and stopping at the door .
i was told that some people in the prison were subjected to corporal punishment .
is it true ?
maslenikoff face flushed .
ah !
you have reference to that affair ?
no , mon cher , you must positively not be admitted there you want to know everything .
come , come ; annette is calling us , he said , seizing nekhludoff arm with the same excitement he evinced after the attention shown him by the important person , but this time alarming , and not joyful .
nekhludoff tore himself loose , and , without bowing or saying anything , gloomily passed through the , the parlor and by the lackeys , who sprang to their feet in the , to the street .
what is the matter with him ?
what did you do to him ?
annette asked her husband .
that is à la française , said some one .
rather à la zoulon .
oh , he has always been queer .
some one arose , some one arrived , and the chirping continued .
the following morning nekhludoff received from maslenikoff a letter on heavy , glossy paper , bearing a and seals , written in a fine , firm hand , in which he said that he had written to the prison physician asking that maslova be transferred , and that he hoped his request would be acceded to .
it was signed , your loving senior comrade , followed by a remarkably skillful flourish .
fool !
nekhludoff could not help exclaiming , especially because he felt that by the word comrade maslenikoff was condescending , , although he considered himself a very important personage , he nevertheless was not too proud of his greatness , and called himself his comrade .
one of the most popular superstitions consists in the belief that every man is endowed with definite qualities that some men are kind , some wicked ; some wise , some foolish ; some energetic , some apathetic , etc .
this is not true .
we may say of a man that he is oftener kind than wicked ; oftener wise than foolish ; oftener energetic than apathetic , and vice versa .
but it would not be true to say of one man that he is always kind or wise , and of another that he is always wicked or foolish .
and yet we thus divide people .
this is erroneous .
men are like rivers the water in all of them , and at every point , is the same , but every one of them is now narrow , now swift , now wide , now calm , now clear , now cold , now muddy , now warm .
so it is with men .
every man bears within him the germs of all human qualities , sometimes manifesting one quality , sometimes another ; and often does not resemble himself at all , manifesting no change .
with some people these changes are particularly sharp .
and to this class nekhludoff belonged .
these changes in him had both physical and spiritual causes ; and one of these changes he was now undergoing .
that feeling of solemnity and joy of rejuvenation which he had experienced after the trial and after his first meeting with katiousha had passed away , and , after the last meeting , fear and even disgust toward her had taken its place .
he was also conscious that his duty was burdensome to him .
he had decided not to leave her , to carry out his intention of marrying her , if she so desired ; but this was painful and tormenting to him .
on the day following his visit to maslenikoff he again went to the prison to see her .
the inspector permitted him to see her ; not in the office , however , nor in the lawyer room , but in the women .
notwithstanding his , the inspector was more reserved than formerly .
evidently nekhludoff conversations with maslenikoff had resulted in instructions being given to be more careful with this visitor .
you may see her , he said , only please remember what i told you as to giving her money .
and as to her transfer to the hospital , about which his excellency has written , there is no objection to it , and the physician also consented .
but she herself does not wish it .
' i care to be chambermaid to that scurvy lot , ' she said .
that is the kind of people they are , prince , he added .
nekhludoff made no answer and asked to be admitted to her .
the inspector sent the warden , and nekhludoff followed him into the empty .
maslova was already there , quietly and timidly emerging from behind the grating .
she approached close to nekhludoff , and , looking past him , quietly said forgive me , dmitri ivanovich ; i have spoken improperly the other day .
it is not for me to forgive you nekhludoff began .
but you must leave me , she added , and in the fearfully squinting eyes with which she glanced at him nekhludoff again saw a strained and spiteful expression .
illustration .
but why should i leave you ?
so .
why so ?
she again looked at him with that spiteful glance , as it seemed to him .
well , then , i will tell you , she said .
you leave me i tell you that truly .
i can not .
you must drop that entirely , she said , with quivering lips , and became silent .
that is true .
i would rather hang myself .
nekhludoff felt that in this answer lurked a hatred for him , an unforgiven wrong , but also something else something good and important .
this reiteration of her refusal in a perfectly calm state destroyed in nekhludoff soul all his doubts , and brought him back to his former grave , solemn and benign state of mind .
katiousha , i repeat what i said , he said , with particular gravity .
i ask you to marry me .
if , however , you do not wish to , and so long as you do not wish to , i will be wherever you will be , and follow you wherever you may be sent .
that is your business .
i will speak no more , she said , and again her lips quivered .
he was also silent , feeling that he had no strength to speak .
i am now going to the country , and from there to petersburg , he said finally .
i will press your our case , and with god help the sentence will be set aside .
i do care if they do .
i deserved it , if not for that , for something else , she said , and he saw what great effort she had to make to repress her tears .
well , have you seen menshova ?
she asked suddenly , in order to hide her agitation .
they are innocent , are they not ?
yes , i think so .
such a wonderful little woman !
she said .
he related everything he had learned from menshova , and asked her if she needed anything .
she said she needed nothing .
they were silent again .
well , and as to the hospital , she said suddenly , casting on him her squinting glance , if you wish me to go , i will go ; and i will stop wine drinking , too .
nekhludoff silently looked in her eyes .
they were smiling .
that is very good , was all he could say .
yes , yes ; she is an entirely different person , thought nekhludoff , for the first time experiencing , after his former doubts , the to him entirely new feeling of confidence in the invincibility of love .
returning to her cell , maslova removed her coat and sat down on her cot , her hands resting on her knees .
in the cell were only the consumptive with her babe , the old woman , menshova , and the with her two children .
the deacon daughter had been removed to the hospital ; the others were washing .
the old woman lay on the cot sleeping ; the children were in the corridor , the door to which was open .
the consumptive with the child in her arms and the , who did not cease knitting a stocking with her nimble fingers , approached maslova .
well , have you seen him ?
they asked .
maslova dangled her feet , which did not reach the floor , and made no answer .
what are you whimpering about ?
said the .
above all , keep up your spirits .
oh , katiousha !
well ?
she said , rapidly moving her fingers .
maslova made no answer .
the women went washing .
they say that alms were larger .
many things have been brought , they say , said the consumptive .
finashka !
shouted the .
where are you , you little rogue ?
she drew out one of the knitting needles , stuck it into the ball of thread and stocking , and went out into the corridor .
at this moment the inmates of the cell , with bare feet in their prison shoes , entered , each bearing a loaf of twisted bread , some even two .
theodosia immediately approached maslova .
why , anything wrong ?
she asked , lovingly , looking with her bright , blue eyes at maslova .
and here is something for our tea , and she placed the leaves on the shelf .
well , has he changed his mind about marrying you ?
asked korableva .
no , he has not , but i do not wish to , answered maslova , and i told him so .
what a fool !
said korableva , in her basso voice .
what is the good of marrying if they can not live together ?
asked theodosia .
is not your husband going with you ?
answered the .
we are legally married , said theodosia .
but why should he marry her legally if he can not live with her ?
what a fool !
why , if he marries her he will make her rich !
he said you may be , i will be with you , ' said maslova .
he may go if he likes ; he need if he do .
i will not ask him .
he is now going to petersburg to try to get me out .
all the ministers there are his relatives , she continued , but i do care for them .
sure enough , korableva suddenly assented , reaching down into her bag , and evidently thinking of something else .
what do you say shall we have some wine ?
not i , answered maslova .
drink yourselves .
.
the senate could hear the case in two weeks , and by that time nekhludoff intended to be in petersburg , and , in case of an adverse decision , to petition the emperor , as the lawyer had advised .
in case the appeal failed , for which , his lawyer had told him , he must be prepared , as the grounds of appeal were very weak , the party of convicts to which maslova belonged would be transported in may .
it was therefore necessary , in order to be prepared to follow maslova to siberia , upon which nekhludoff was firmly resolved , to go to the villages and arrange his affairs there .
first of all , he went to the kusminskoie estate , the nearest , largest estate , which brought the greatest income .
he had lived on the estate in his childhood and youth , and had also twice visited it in his manhood , once when , upon the request of his mother , he brought a german manager with whom he went over the affairs of the estate .
so that he knew its condition and the relations the peasants sustained toward the office , , the landowner .
their relations toward the office were such that they have always been in absolute dependence upon it .
nekhludoff had already known it when as a student he professed and preached the doctrines of henry george , and in carrying out which he had distributed his father estate among the peasants .
true , after his military career , when he was spending twenty thousand rubles a year , those doctrines ceased to be necessary to the life he was leading , were forgotten , and not only did he not ask himself where the money came from , but tried not to think of it .
but the death of his mother , the inheritance , and the necessity of taking care of his property , , his lands , again raised the question in his mind of his relation to private ownership of land .
a month before nekhludoff would have argued that he was powerless to change the existing order of things ; that he was not managing the estate , and living and receiving his income far away from the estate , would feel more or less at ease .
but now he resolved that , although there was before him a trip to siberia and complex and difficult relations to the prison world , for which social standing , and especially money , were necessary , he could not , nevertheless , leave his affairs in their former condition , but must , to his own detriment , change them .
for this purpose he had decided not to work the land himself , but , by renting it at a low price to the peasants , to make it possible for them to live independent of the landlord .
often , while comparing the position of the landlord with that of the owner of serfs , nekhludoff found a parallel in the renting of the land to the peasants , instead of working it by hired labor , to what the did when they substituted tenancy for serfdom .
that did not solve the question , but it was a step toward its solution ; it was a transition from a grosser to a less gross form of ownership of man .
he also intended to act thus .
nekhludoff arrived at kusminskoie about noon .
in everything simplifying his life , he did not wire from the station of his arrival , but hired a country coach .
the driver was a young fellow in a nankeen regulation coat , belted below the waist , sitting sidewise on the box .
he was the more willing to carry on a conversation because the , lame , emaciated , foaming could then walk , which these horses always preferred .
the driver spoke about the manager of the kusminskoie estate , not knowing that he was carrying its master , nekhludoff purposely refrained from enlightening him .
a dandy german , he said , turning half around , cracking his long whip now over the heads , now under the horses .
there is nothing here to compare with his fine team of three bay horses .
you ought to see him driving out with his wife !
i took some guests to his house last christmas he had a fine tree .
you could find the like of it in the whole district !
he robbed everybody , right and left .
but what does he care ?
he is bossing everybody .
they say he bought a fine estate .
nekhludoff thought that he was indifferent to the manner of the german management , and to the way he was profiting by it .
but the story of the driver with the long waist was unpleasant to him .
he was enchanted with the fine weather ; the darkening clouds , sometimes obscuring the sun ; the fields over which the larks soared ; the woods , just covering up the top and bottom with green ; the meadows on which the flocks and horses browsed , and the fields on which plowmen were already seen but a feeling of dissatisfaction crept over him .
and when he asked himself the reason for it , he recalled the account of the german management .
but by the time he was busying himself with the affairs of kusminskoie he had forgotten it .
after an examination of the books and his conversation with the clerk , who artlessly set forth the advantages of the peasants having small holdings and the fact that they were hemmed in by the master land , nekhludoff grew only more determined to put an end to his ownership , and give the land to the peasants .
from the books and his conversations with the clerk he learned that , as before , of the best arable land was cultivated by his own men , and the rest by peasants who were paid five rubles per acre that is to say , for five rubles the peasant undertook to plow , harrow and sow an acre of land three times , then mow it , bind or press it , and carry it to the barn .
in other words , he was paid five rubles for what hired , cheap labor would cost at least ten rubles .
again , the prices paid by the peasants to the office for necessaries were enormous .
they worked for meadow , for wood , for potatoe seed , and they were almost all in debt to the office .
thus , the rent charged the peasants for lands beyond the fields was four times as great as it could bring on a five per cent .
basis .
nekhludoff knew all that before , but he was now learning it as something new , and only wondered why he and all those who stood in a similar position could fail to see the enormity of such relations .
the arguments of the clerk that not of the value of the stock could be realized on a sale , that the peasants would permit the land to run to waste , only strengthened his determination and confirmed him in his belief that he was doing a good deed by giving the land to the peasants , and depriving himself of the greater part of his income .
desiring to dispose of the land forthwith , he asked the manager to call together the peasants of the three villages surrounded by his lands the very next day , for the purpose of declaring to them his intention and agreeing with them as to the price .
with a joyful consciousness of his firmness , in spite of the arguments of the manager , and his readiness to make sacrifices for the peasants , nekhludoff left the office , and , reflecting on the coming arrangement , he strolled around the house , through the , which lay opposite the manager house , and was neglected this year ; over the ground , overgrown with chicory , and through the alleys lined with lindens , where it had been his wont to smoke his cigar , and where , three years before , the pretty visitor , kirimova , flirted with him .
having made an outline of a speech , which he was to deliver to the peasants the following day , nekhludoff went to the house , and after further deliberating upon the proper disposition of the stock , he calmly and contentedly retired to a room prepared for him in the large building .
in this clean room , the walls of which were covered with views of venice , and with a mirror hung between two windows , there was placed a clean spring bedstead and a small table with water and matches .
on a large table near the mirror lay his open with toilet articles and books which he brought with him ; one russian book on criminology , one in german , and a third in english treating of the same subject .
he intended to read them in spare moments while traveling through the villages , but as he looked on them now he felt that his mind was far from these subjects .
something entirely different occupied him .
in one corner of the room there stood an ancient with incrustations , and the sight of this chair standing in his suddenly raised in his soul an unexpected feeling .
he suddenly felt sorry for the house that would decay , the gardens which would be neglected , the woods which would be cut down , and all the , courts , stables , sheds , machinery , horses , cows which had been accumulated with such effort , although not by him .
at first it seemed to him easy to abandon all that , but now he was loth to part with it , as well as the land and of the income which would be so useful now .
and immediately serviceable arguments come to his aid , by which it appeared that it was not wise to give the land to the peasants and destroy his estate .
i have no right to own the land .
and if i do not own the land , i can not keep the property intact .
besides , i will now go to siberia , and for that reason i need neither the house nor the estate , whispered one voice .
all that is true , whispered another voice , but you will not pass all your life in siberia .
if you should marry , you may have children .
and you must hand over the estate to them in the same condition in which you found it .
there are duties toward the land .
it is easy to give away the land , to destroy everything ; but it is very hard to accumulate it .
above all , you must mark out a plan of your life , and dispose of your property accordingly .
and , then , are you acting as you do in order to satisfy conscientious scruples , or for the praise you expect of people ?
nekhludoff asked himself , and could not help acknowledging that the talk that it would occasion influenced his decision .
and the more he thought the more questions raised themselves , and the more perplexing they appeared .
to rid himself of these thoughts he lay down on the bed , intending to go over them again the next day with a clearer mind .
but he could not fall asleep for a long time .
along with the fresh air , through the open window , came the croaking of frogs , interrupted by the whistling of nightingales , one of which was in a lilac bush under the window .
listening to the nightingales and the frogs , nekhludoff recalled the music of the inspector daughter ; and , thinking of that music , he recalled maslova how , like the croaking of a frog , her lips trembled when she said , you must drop that .
then the german manager descended to the frogs .
he should have been held back , but not only did he come down , but he was transformed into maslova and started to taunt him i am a convict , and you are a prince .
no , i shall not yield , thought nekhludoff , and came to .
am i acting properly or improperly ?
he asked himself .
i do know ; i will know .
and he began to descend to where the manager and maslova were .
and there everything ended .
with a feeling of timidity and shame nekhludoff the following morning , walked out to meet the peasants who had gathered at a small square in front of the house .
as he approached them the peasants removed their caps , and for a long time nekhludoff could not say anything .
although he was going to do something for the peasants which they never dared even to think of , his conscience was troubled .
the peasants stood in a fine , drizzling rain , waiting to hear what their master had to say , and nekhludoff was so confused that he could not open his mouth .
the calm , german came to his relief .
this strong , overfed man , like nekhludoff himself , made a striking contrast to the emaciated , wrinkled faces of the peasants , and the bare sticking out from under their caftans .
the prince came to befriend you to give you the land , but you are not worthy of it , said the german .
why not worthy , vasily karlych ?
have we not labored for you ?
we are much satisfied with our late mistress may she enjoy eternal life ! and we are grateful to the young prince for thinking of us , began a peasant with a gift of gab .
we are not complaining of our masters , said a peasant with a long beard .
only we are too crowded here .
that is what i called you here for to give you the land , if you wish it , said nekhludoff .
the peasants were silent , as if misunderstanding him , or incredulous .
in what sense do you mean to give us the land ?
asked a peasant in a caftan .
to rent it to you , that you might use it at a low price .
that is the loveliest thing , said an old man .
if the payment is not above our means , said another .
of course we will take the land .
it is our business we get our sustenance from the land .
so much the better for you .
all you have to do is to take the money .
and what sins you will spare yourself the sin is on you , said the german .
if you would only work and keep things in order we can not , vasily karlych , said a lean old man with a pointed nose .
you ask , who let the horse feed in the field ?
but who did it ?
day in and day out and every day is as long as a year i worked with the scythe , and as i fell asleep the horse went among the oats .
and now you are fleecing me .
you should keep order .
it is easy for you to say keep order .
but we have no strength , retorted a peasant , all covered with hair .
i told you to fence it in .
you give us the timber , said an unsightly little peasant .
when i cut a joist last summer , intending to make a fence , you locked me up for three months in the castle to feed the insects .
there was a fence for you !
is that true ?
asked nekhludoff of the manager .
der erste dich im dorfe , said the manager in german .
he was caught every year in the woods .
you must learn to respect other property .
do we not respect you ?
said an old man .
we can not help respecting you , because you have us in your hands , and you are twisting us into rope .
if you would only abstain from doing wrong , said the manager .
it is pretty hard to wrong you .
and who battered my face last summer ?
of course , there is no use going to law with a rich man .
you only keep within bounds of the law .
this was evidently a wordy tourney of which the participants hardly knew the purpose .
nekhludoff tried to get back to business .
well , what do you say ?
do you wish the land , and what price do you set on it ?
it is your goods ; you name the price .
nekhludoff set the price , and though much lower than the prevailing price , the peasants began to bargain , finding it high .
he expected that his offer would be accepted with pleasure , but there was no sign of satisfaction .
only when the question was raised whether the whole community would take the land , or have individual arrangements did he know that it was profitable for them .
for there resulted fierce quarrels between those who wished to exclude the weak ones and bad payers from participating in the land , and those whom it was sought to exclude .
but the german finally arranged the price and time of payment , and the peasants , noisily talking , returned to the village .
the price was about thirty per cent .
lower than the one prevailing in the district , and nekhludoff income was reduced to almost , but , with money realized from the sale of the timber and yet to be realized from the sale of the stock , it was amply sufficient for him .
everything seemed to be satisfactory , and yet nekhludoff felt sad and lonesome , but , above all , his conscience troubled him .
he saw that although the peasants spoke words of thanks , they were not satisfied and expected something more .
the result was that while he deprived himself of much , he failed to do that which the peasants expected .
on the following day , after the contract was signed , nekhludoff , with an unpleasant feeling of having left something undone , seated himself in the dandy team and took leave of the peasants , who were shaking their heads in doubt and dissatisfaction .
nekhludoff was dissatisfied with himself he could not tell why , but he felt sad , and was ashamed of something .
from kusminskoie nekhludoff went to panovo , the estate left him by his aunts , and where he had first seen katiousha .
he intended to dispose of this land in the same manner as he disposed of the other , and also desired to learn all there was known about katiousha , and to find out if it was true that their child had died .
as he sat at the window observing the familiar scenery of the now somewhat neglected estate , he not only recalled , but felt himself as he was fourteen years ago ; fresh , pure and filled with the hope of endless possibilities .
but as it happens in a dream , he knew that that was gone , and he became very sad .
before breakfast he made his way to the hut of matrena kharina , katiousha aunt , who was selling liquor surreptitiously , for information about the child , but all he could learn from her was that the child had died on the way to a moskow asylum ; in proof of which the midwife had brought a certificate .
on his way back he entered the huts of some peasants , and inquired about their mode of living .
the same complaints of the paucity of land , hunger and degradation he heard everywhere .
he saw the same pinched faces , threadbare homespuns , bare feet and bent shoulders .
in front of a particularly dilapidated hut stood a number of women with children in their arms , and among them he noticed a lean , woman , easily holding a bloodless child in a short garment made of pieces of stuff .
this child was incessantly smiling .
nekhludoff knew that it was the smile of suffering .
he asked who that woman was .
it transpired that the woman husband had been in prison for the past six months feeding the insects as they termed it , for cutting down two lindens .
nekhludoff turned to the woman , anisia .
how do you fare ?
he asked .
what do you live on ?
how do i live ?
i sometimes get some food , and she began to sob .
the grave face of the child , however , spread into a broad smile , and its thin legs began to wriggle .
nekhludoff produced his pocketbook and gave the woman ten rubles .
he had scarcely made ten steps when he was overtaken by another woman with a child ; then an old woman , and again another woman .
they all spoke of their poverty and implored his help .
nekhludoff distributed the sixty rubles that were in his pocketbook and returned home , , to the wing inhabited by the clerk .
the clerk , smiling , met nekhludoff with the information that the peasants would gather in the evening , as he had ordered .
nekhludoff thanked him and strolled about the garden , meditating on what he had seen .
the people are dying in large numbers , and are used to it ; they have acquired modes of living natural to a people who are becoming extinct the death of children , exhausting toil for women , insufficiency of food for all , especially for the aged all comes and is received naturally .
they were reduced to this condition gradually , so that they can not see the horror of it , and bear it uncomplainingly .
afterward , we , too , come to consider this condition natural ; that it ought to be so .
all this was so clear to him now that he could not cease wondering how it was that people could not see it ; that he himself could not see that which is so patent .
it was perfectly clear that children and old people were dying for want of milk , and they had no milk because they had not land enough to feed the cattle and also raise bread and hay .
and he devised a scheme by which he was to give the land to the people , and they were to pay an annual rent which was to go to the community , to be used for common utilities and taxes .
this was not the , but it was the nearest approach to it under present conditions .
the important part consisted in that he renounced his right to own land .
when he returned to the house , the clerk , with a particularly happy smile on his face , offered him dinner , expressing his fear that it might spoil .
the table was covered with a gloomy cloth , an embroidered towel serving as a napkin , and on the table , in , stood a with a broken handle , filled with potato soup and containing the same rooster that he had seen carried into the house on his arrival .
after the soup came the same rooster , fried with feathers , and cakes made of , bountifully covered with butter and sugar .
although the taste of it all was poor , nekhludoff kept on eating , being absorbed in the thoughts which relieved him of the sadness that oppressed him on his return from the village .
after dinner nekhludoff with difficulty seated the superserviceable clerk , and in order to make sure of himself and at the same time to confide to some one the thoughts uppermost in his mind , told him of his project and asked his opinion .
the clerk smiled , as though he had been thinking of the same thing , and was very glad to hear it , but in reality did not understand it , not because nekhludoff did not express himself plainly enough , but because , according to this project , nekhludoff deprived himself of advantages for the benefit of others , whereas the truth that every man strives to obtain advantages at the expense of others , was so firmly rooted in the clerk mind , that he thought that he misunderstood nekhludoff when the latter said that the entire income of the land was to go into the community treasury .
i understand .
so you will draw the interest on the capital ?
he said , becoming radiant .
no , no .
i transfer the land to them entirely .
in that case you will get no income ?
asked the clerk and he ceased to smile .
i relinquish that .
the clerk sighed deeply , then began to smile again .
now he understood .
he understood that nekhludoff mind was not entirely sound , and he immediately tried to find a way of profiting by nekhludoff project , and endeavored to so construe it that he might turn it to his own advantage .
when , however , he understood that there was no such opportunity , he ceased to take interest in the projects , and continued to smile only to please his master .
seeing that the clerk could not understand him , nekhludoff dismissed him from his presence , seated himself at the table and proceeded to commit his project to paper .
the sun was already descending behind the unfolding lindens , and the mosquitos filled the room , stinging him .
while he was finishing his notes , nekhludoff heard the lowing of cattle in the village , the creaking of the opening gates and the voices of the peasants who were coming to meet their master .
nekhludoff told the clerk not to call them before the office , that he would go and meet them at any place in the village , and gulping down a glass of tea offered him by the clerk , he went to the village .
the crowd stood talking in front of the house of the bailiff , and as nekhludoff approached , the conversation ceased and the peasants , like those of kusminskoie , removed their caps .
it was a coarser crowd than the peasants of kusminskoie , and almost all the peasants wore bast shoes and homespun shirts and caftans .
some of them were and only in their shirts .
with some effort nekhludoff began his speech by declaring that he intended to surrender the land to them .
the peasants were silent , and there was no change in the expression of their faces .
because i consider , said nekhludoff , blushing , that every man ought to have the right to use the land .
why , certainly .
that is quite right , voices of peasants were heard .
nekhludoff continued , saying that the income from the land should be distributed among all , and he therefore proposed that they take the land and pay into the common treasury such rent as they may decide upon , such money to be used for their own benefit .
exclamations of consent and approbation continued to be heard , but the faces of the peasants became more and more grave , and the eyes that at first were fixed on the master were lowered , as if desiring not to shame him with the fact that his cunning was understood by all , and that he could not fool anybody .
nekhludoff spoke very clearly , and the peasants were sensible folks ; but he was not understood , and could not be understood by them for the same reason which prevented the clerk from understanding him for a long time .
they were convinced that it was natural for every man to look out for his own interest .
and as to the land owners , the experience of several generations had taught them long ago that these were always serving their own interests .
well , what rate do you intend to assess , asked nekhludoff .
why assess ?
we can not do that ?
the land is yours ; it is for you to say , some in the crowd said .
but understand that you are to use the money for the common wants .
we can not do it .
the community is one thing , and this is another thing .
you must understand , said the smiling clerk , wishing to explain the offer , that the prince is giving you the land for money which is to go into the community treasury .
we understand it very well , said a toothless old man without raising his eyes .
something like a bank , only we must pay in time .
we can not do it ; it is hard enough as it is .
that will ruin us entirely .
that is to no purpose .
we would rather continue as before , said several dissatisfied and even rough voices .
the resistance was particularly hot when nekhludoff mentioned that he would draw a contract which he himself and they would have to sign .
what is the good of a contract ?
we will keep on working as we did before .
we do care for it .
we are ignorant people .
we can not consent , because that is an uncustomary thing .
let it be as it was before .
if you would only do away with the seed , several voices were heard .
doing away with the seed meant that under the present regime the was chargeable to the peasants , and they asked that it be furnished by the master .
so you refuse to take the land ?
asked nekhludoff , turning to a , peasant in tattered caftan and with a radiant face who held his cap straight in front of him , like a soldier hearing hats off !
yes , sir , said this peasant .
then you have enough land ?
asked nekhludoff .
no , sir , said the , with artificial cheerfulness , holding his torn cap before him , as though offering it to anyone deserving to take it .
think it over at your leisure , said the surprised nekhludoff , again repeating his offer .
there is nothing to think over ; as we said , so it will be , the toothless , gloomy old man said angrily .
i will stay here all day .
if you alter your decision , let me know .
the peasants made no answer .
on their return to the office the clerk explained to nekhludoff that it was not a want of good sense that prevented their acceptance of the offer ; that when gathered in assembly they always acted in that stubborn manner .
nekhludoff then asked him to summon for the following day several of the most intelligent peasants to whom he would explain his project at greater length .
immediately after the departure of the smiling clerk , nekhludoff heard angry women voices interrupted by the voice of the clerk .
he listened .
i have no more strength .
you want the cross on my breast , said an exasperated voice .
she only ran in , said another voice .
give her up , i say .
why do you torture the beast , and keep the milk from the children ?
nekhludoff walked around the house where he saw two disheveled women , one of whom was evidently pregnant , standing near the staircase .
on the stairs , with his hands in the pockets of his crash overcoat , stood the clerk .
seeing their master , the women became silent and began to arrange their , which had fallen from their heads , while the clerk took his hands out of his pockets and began to smile .
the clerk explained that the peasants purposely permitted their calves , and even cows , to roam over the master meadows .
that two cows belonging to these women had been caught on the meadow and driven into an inclosure .
the clerk demanded from the women thirty copecks per cow , or two days ' work .
time and again i told them , said the smiling clerk , looking around at nekhludoff , as if calling him to witness , to look out for cows when driving them to feed .
i just went to see to the child , and they walked away .
do leave them when you undertake to look after them .
and who would feed my child ?
if they had only grazed , at least , they would have no pains in their stomachs .
but they only walked in .
all the meadows are spoiled , the clerk turned to nekhludoff .
if they are not made to pay there will be no hay left .
do be sinning , cried the pregnant woman .
my cow was never caught .
but now that she was caught , pay for her , or work .
well , then , i will work .
but return me the cow ; do torture her , she cried angrily .
it is bad enough as it is ; i get no rest , either day or night .
is sick ; my husband is drunk .
i have to do all the work , and i have no strength .
may you choke yourself !
she shouted and began to weep .
nekhludoff asked the clerk to release the cows and returned to the house , wondering why people do not see what is so plain .
whether it was because there were fewer peasants present , or because he was not occupied with himself , but with the matter in hand , nekhludoff felt no agitation when the seven peasants chosen from the villagers responded to the summons .
he first of all expressed his views on private ownership of land .
as i look upon it , he said , land ought not to be the subject of purchase and sale , for if land can be sold , then those who have money will buy it all in and charge the landless what they please for the use of it .
people will then be compelled to pay for the right to stand on the earth , he added , quoting spencer argument .
there remains to put on wings and fly , said an old man with smiling eyes and gray beard .
that so , said a peasant in a deep basso .
yes , sir , said the .
the old woman took some grass for the cow .
they caught her , and to jail she went , said a , lame peasant .
there is land for five miles around , but the rent is higher than the land can produce , said the toothless , angry old man .
i am of the same opinion as you , said nekhludoff , and that is the reason i want to give you the land .
well , that would be a kind deed , said a old peasant with a curly , grayish beard like that of michael angelo moses , evidently thinking that nekhludoff intended to rent out the land .
that is why i came here .
i do not wish to own the land any longer , but it is necessary to consider how to dispose of it .
you give it to the peasants that all , said the toothless , angry peasant .
for a moment nekhludoff was confused , seeing in these words doubt of the sincerity of his purpose .
but he shook it off , and took advantage of the remark to say what he intended .
i would be only too glad to give it , he said , but to whom and how shall i give it ?
why should i give it to your community rather than to the deminsky community ?
deminsky was a neighboring village with very little land .
they were all silent .
only the said , yes , sir .
and now tell me how would you distribute the land ?
how ?
we would give each an equal share , said an , rapidly raising and lowering his eyebrows .
how else ?
of course divide it equally , said a , lame peasant , whose feet , instead of socks , were wound in a white strip of linen .
this decision was acquiesced in by all as being satisfactory .
but how ?
asked nekhludoff , are the domestics also to receive equal shares ?
no , sir , said the , assuming a cheerful mood .
but the tall peasant disagreed with him .
if it is to be divided , everybody is to get an equal share , after considering awhile , he said in a deep basso .
that is impossible , said nekhludoff , who was already prepared with his objection .
if everyone was to get an equal share , then those who do not themselves work would sell their shares to the rich .
thus the land would again get into the hands of the rich .
again , the people that worked their own shares would multiply , and the landlords would again get the landless into their power .
yes , sir , the hastily assented .
the selling of land should be prohibited ; only those that cultivate it themselves should be allowed to own it , said the , angrily interrupting the soldier .
to this nekhludoff answered that it would be difficult to determine whether one cultivated the land for himself or for others .
then the old man suggested that the land should be given to them as an association , and that only those that took part in cultivating it should get their share .
nekhludoff was ready with arguments against this communistic scheme , and he retorted that in such case it would be necessary that all should have plows , that each should have the same number of horses , and that none should lag behind , or that everything should belong to society , for which the consent of every one was necessary .
our people will never agree , said the angry old man .
there will be incessant fighting among them , said the peasant with the shining eyes .
the women will scratch each eyes out .
the next important question is , said nekhludoff , how to divide the land according to quality .
you can not give black soil to some and clay and sand to others .
let each have a part of both , said the .
to this nekhludoff answered that it was not a question of dividing the land in one community , but of the division of land generally among all the communities .
if the land is to be given gratis to the peasants , then why should some get good land , and others poor land ?
there would be a rush for the good land .
yes , sir , said the .
the others were silent .
you see , it is not as simple as it appears at first sight , said nekhludoff .
we are not the only ones , there are other people thinking of the same thing .
and now , there is an american , named george , who devised the following scheme , and i agree with him .
what is that to you ?
you are the master ; you distribute the land , and there is an end to it , said the angry peasant .
this interruption somewhat confused nekhludoff , but he was glad to see that others were also dissatisfied with this interruption .
hold on , uncle semen ; let him finish , said the old man in an impressive basso .
this encouraged nekhludoff , and he proceeded to explain the theory of henry george .
the land belongs to no one it belongs to the creator .
that so !
yes , sir .
the land belongs to all in common .
every one has an equal right to it .
but there is good land , and there is poor land .
and the question is , how to divide the land equally .
the answer to this is , that those who own the better land should pay to those who own the poorer the value of the better land .
but as it is difficult to determine how much anyone should pay , and to whom , and as society needs money for common utilities , let every land owner pay to society the full value of his land less , if it is poorer ; more , if it is better .
and those who do not wish to own land will have their taxes paid by the land owners .
that correct , said the .
let the owner of the better land pay more .
what a head that jhorga had on him !
said the portly old peasant with the curls .
if only the payments were reasonable , said the tall peasant , evidently understanding what it was leading to .
the payments should be such that it would be neither too cheap nor too dear .
if too dear , it would be unprofitable ; if too cheap , people would begin to deal in land .
this is the arrangement i would like you to make .
voices of approval showed that the peasants understood him perfectly .
what a head !
repeated the peasant with the curls , meaning jhorga .
and what if i should choose to take land ?
said the clerk , smiling .
if there is an unoccupied section , take and cultivate it , said nekhludoff .
what do you want land for ?
you are not hungering without land , said the old man with the smiling eyes .
here the conference ended .
nekhludoff repeated his offer , telling the peasants to consult the wish of the community , before giving their answer .
the peasants said that they would do so , took leave of nekhludoff and departed in a state of excitement .
for a long time their loud voices were heard , and finally died away about midnight .
the peasants did not work the following day , but discussed their master proposition .
the community was divided into two factions .
one declared the proposition profitable and safe ; the other saw in the proposition a plot which it feared the more because it could not understand it .
on the third day , however , the proposition was accepted , the fears of the peasants having been allayed by an old woman who explained the master action by the suggestion that he began to think of saving his soul .
this explanation was confirmed by the large amount of money nekhludoff had distributed while he remained in panov .
these money gifts were called forth by the fact that here , for the first time , he learned to what poverty the peasants had been reduced and though he knew that it was unwise , he could not help distributing such money as he had , which was considerable .
as soon as it became known that the master was distributing money , large crowds of people from the entire surrounding country came to him asking to be helped .
he had no means of determining the respective needs of the individuals , and yet he could not help giving these evidently poor people money .
again , to distribute money indiscriminately was absurd .
his only way out of the difficulty was to depart , which he hastened to do .
on the third day of his visit to panov , nekhludoff , while looking over the things in the house , in one of the drawers of his chiffonnier , found a picture representing a group of sophia ivanovna , catherine ivanovna , himself , as student , and katiousha neat , fresh , beautiful and full of life .
of all the things in the house nekhludoff removed this picture and the letters .
the rest he sold to the miller for a tenth part of its value .
recalling now the feeling of pity over the loss of his property which he had experienced in kusminskoie , nekhludoff wondered how he could have done so .
now he experienced the gladness of release and the feeling of novelty akin to that experienced by an explorer who discovers new lands .
it was evening when nekhludoff arrived in the city , and as he drove through the streets to his house , it looked to him like a new city .
the odor of camphor still hung in the air through all the rooms , and agrippina , petrovna and kornei seemed tired out and dissatisfied , and even quarreled about the packing of the things , the use of which seemed to consist chiefly in being hung out , dried and packed away again .
his room was not occupied , but was not arranged for his coming , and the trunks blocked all the passages , so that his coming interfered with those affairs which , by some strange inertia , were taking place in this house .
this evident foolishness , to which he had once been a party , seemed so unpleasant to nekhludoff , after the impressions he had gained of the want in the villages , that he decided to move to a hotel the very next day , leaving the packing to agrippina until the arrival of his sister .
he left the house in the morning , hired two modest and not furnished rooms near the prison , and went to his lawyer .
after the storms and rains came those cold , piercing winds that usually occur in the fall .
protected only by a light overcoat , nekhludoff was chilled to the bone .
he walked quickly in order to warm himself .
the village scenes came to his mind the women , children and old men , whose poverty and exhaustion he had noticed as if for the first time , especially that oldish child which twisted its little calfless legs and he involuntarily compared them with the city folks .
passing by the butcher , fish and clothing shops , he was struck , as if it was the first time he looked upon them by the physical evidences of the of such a large number of clean , shopkeepers which was not to be seen anywhere in the villages .
equally well fed were the drivers in quilted coats and buttons on their backs , porters , servant girls , etc .
in all these people he now involuntarily saw those same village folks whom privation had driven to the city .
some of them were able to take advantage of the conditions in the city and became happy proprietors themselves ; others were reduced to even greater straits and became even more wretched .
such wretchedness nekhludoff saw in a number of shoemakers that he saw working near the window of a basement ; in the lean , pale , disheveled washerwomen ironing with bare hands before open windows from which steam poured out ; in two painters , aproned and , who were covered with paint from temple to heel .
in their sunburnt , sinewy , weak hands , bared above the elbows , they carried a bucket of paint and incessantly cursed each other .
their faces were wearied and angry .
the same expression of weariness and anger he saw in the dusty faces of the truck drivers ; on the swollen and tattered men , women and children who stood begging on the street corners .
similar faces were seen in the windows of the which nekhludoff passed .
around the dirty tables , loaded with bottles and tea services , perspiring men with red , stupefied faces sat shouting and singing , and servants flitted to and fro .
why have they all gathered here ?
thought nekhludoff , involuntarily inhaling , together with the dust , the odor of rancid oil spread by the fresh paint .
on one of the streets he suddenly heard his name called above the rattling of the trucks .
it was shenbok , with curled and stiffened mustache and radiant face .
nekhludoff had lost sight of him long ago , but heard that on leaving his regiment and joining the cavalry , notwithstanding his debts he managed to hold his own in rich society .
i am glad i met you .
there is not a soul in the city .
how old you have grown , my boy !
i only recognized you by your walk .
well , shall we have dinner together ?
where can we get a good meal here ?
i hardly think i will have the time , answered nekhludoff , who wished to get rid of his friend without offending him .
what brings you here ?
he asked .
business , my boy .
guardianship affairs .
i am a guardian , you know .
i have charge of samanoff business the rich samanoff , you know .
he is a spendthrift , and there are thousand acres of land !
he said with particular pride , as if he had himself made all these acres .
the affairs were fearfully neglected .
the land was rented to the peasants , who did not pay anything and were eighty thousand rubles in arrears .
in one year i changed everything , and realized seventy per cent .
more for the estate .
eh ?
he asked , with pride .
nekhludoff recalled a rumor that for the very reason that shenbok squandered his own wealth and was inextricably in debt , he was appointed guardian over a rich old spendthrift , and was now evidently obtaining an income from the guardianship .
nekhludoff refused to take dinner with shenbok , or accompany him to the horse races , to which the latter invited him , and after an exchange of commonplaces the two parted .
is it possible that i was like him ?
thought nekhludoff .
not exactly , but i sought to be like him , and thought that i would thus pass my life .
the lawyer received him immediately on his arrival , although it was not his turn .
the lawyer expressed himself strongly on the detention of the menshovs , declaring that there was not a particle of evidence against them on record .
if the case is tried here , and not in the district , i will stake anything on their discharge .
and the petition in behalf of theodosia brinkova is ready .
you had better take it with you to petersburg and present it there .
otherwise there will begin an inquiry which will have no end .
try to reach some people who have influence with the commission on petitions .
well , that all , is it ?
no .
here they write me you seem to be the funnel into which all the prison complaints are poured .
i fear you will not hold them all .
but this case is simply shocking , said nekhludoff , and related the substance of it .
what is it that surprises you ?
everything .
i can understand the orderly who acted under orders , but the assistant prosecutor who drew the indictment is an educated man that is the mistake .
we are used to think that the prosecuting officers the court officers generally are a kind of new , liberal men .
and so they were at one time , but not now .
the only thing that concerns these officers is to draw their salaries on the of every month .
their principles begin and end with their desire to get more .
they will arrest , try and convict anybody .
i am always telling these court officers that i never look upon them without gratitude , continued the lawyer , because it is due to their kindness that i , you and all of us are not in jail .
to deprive any one of us of all civil rights and send him to siberia is the easiest thing imaginable .
but if everything depends on the pleasure of the prosecutor , who can enforce the law or not , then what is the use of the courts ?
the lawyer laughed merrily .
that is the question you are raising .
well , my dear sir , that is philosophy .
however , we can discuss that .
come to my house next saturday .
you will find there scholars , litterateurs , artists .
we will have a talk on social questions , said the lawyer , pronouncing the words social questions with ironical pathos .
are you acquainted with my wife ?
call on saturday .
i will try , answered nekhludoff , feeling that he was saying an untruth ; that if there was anything he would try hard to do it was not to be present at the lawyer amid the scholars , litterateurs and artists .
the laughter with which the lawyer met nekhludoff remark concerning the uselessness of courts if the prosecutors can do what they please , and the intonation with which he pronounced the words philosophy and social questions , showed how utterly unlike himself were the lawyer and the people of his circle , both in character and in views of life .
it was late and the distance to the prison was long , so nekhludoff hired a trap .
on one of the streets the driver , who was a man with an intelligent and face , turned to nekhludoff and pointed to an immense building going up .
what a huge building there is going up !
he said with pride , as if he had a part in the building of it .
it was really a huge structure , built in a complex , unusual style .
a scaffolding of heavy pine logs surrounded the structure , which was fenced in by deal boards .
it was as busy a scene as an ant hill .
nekhludoff wondered that these people , while their wives were killing themselves with work at home , and their children starving , should think it necessary to build that foolish and unnecessary house for some foolish and unnecessary man .
yes , a foolish building , he spoke his thought aloud .
how foolish ?
retorted the offended driver .
thanks to them , the people get work .
it is not foolish .
but the work is unnecessary .
it must be necessary if they are building it , said the driver .
it gives the people food .
nekhludoff became silent , the more so because it was too noisy to be heard .
when they had reached the macadamized road near the prison the driver again turned to nekhludoff .
and what a lot of people are coming to the city awful , he said , turning around on the box and pointing to a party of laborers with saws , axes , coats and sacks thrown over their shoulders , and coming from the opposite direction .
more than in former years ?
asked nekhludoff .
no comparison .
the masters are kicking them about like shavings .
the market places are glutted with them .
what is the reason ?
they have multiplied .
they have no homes .
and what if they have multiplied !
why do they not remain in the villages ?
there is nothing to do there .
there is no land .
nekhludoff experienced that which happens with a sore place it is struck oftener than any other part of the body .
but it only seems so because it is more noticeable .
can it be possible that it is everywhere the same ?
he thought , and asked the driver how much land there was in his village ; how much he himself owned , and why he lived in the city .
there is but an acre to every person .
we are renting three acres .
there is my father and brother .
another brother is in the army .
they are managing it .
but there is really nothing to manage , and my brother intended to go to moskow .
is there no land for rent ?
where could one get land nowadays ?
the masters ' children have squandered theirs .
the merchants have it all in their hands .
one can not rent it from them ; they cultivate it themselves .
our lands are held by a frenchman who bought them of the former landlord .
he rent any of it , and that is all .
what frenchman ?
dufar , the frenchman you may have heard .
he is making wigs for the actors .
he is now our master , and does what he pleases with us .
he is a good man himself , but his wife is russian and what a cur !
she is robbing the people simply awful !
but here is the prison .
shall i drive up to the front ?
i think they do admit through the front .
with a faint heart and with horror at the thought that he might find maslova in an inebriate condition and persistently antagonistic , and at the mystery which she was to him , nekhludoff rang the bell and inquired of the inspector about maslova .
she was in the hospital .
a young physician , impregnated with carbolic acid , came out into the corridor and sternly asked nekhludoff what he wanted .
the physician indulged the prisoners ' shortcomings and often relaxed the rules in their favor , for which he often ran afoul of the prison officials and even the head physician .
fearing that nekhludoff might ask something not permitted by the rules , and , moreover , desiring to show that he made no exceptions in favor of anybody , he feigned anger .
there are no women here ; this is the children ward , he said .
i know it , but there is a nurse here who had been transferred from the prison .
yes , there are two .
what do you wish , then ?
i am closely related to one of them , maslova , said nekhludoff , and would like to see her .
i am going to petersburg to enter an appeal in her case .
i would like to hand her this ; it is only a photograph , and he produced an envelope from his pocket .
yes , you may do that , said the softened physician , and turning to an old nurse in a white apron , told her to call maslova .
wo you take a seat , or come into the ?
thank you , said nekhludoff , and taking advantage of the favorable change in the physician demeanor , asked him what they thought of maslova in the hospital .
her work is fair , considering the conditions amid which she had lived , answered the physician .
but there she comes .
the old nurse appeared at one of the doors , and behind her came maslova .
she wore a white apron over a striped skirt ; a white cap on her head hid her hair .
seeing nekhludoff she flushed , stopped waveringly , then frowned , and with downcast eyes approached him with quick step .
coming near him she stood for a moment without offering her hand , then she did offer her hand and became even more flushed .
nekhludoff had not seen her since the conversation in which she excused herself for her impetuosity , and he expected to find her in a similar mood .
but she was entirely different ; there was something new in the expression of her face ; something timid and reserved , and , as it seemed to him , malevolent toward him .
he repeated the words he had said to the physician and handed her the envelope with the photograph which he had brought from panov .
it is an old picture which i came across in panov .
it may please you to have it .
take it .
raising her black eyebrows she looked at him with her squinting eyes , as though asking , what is that for ?
then she silently took the envelope and tucked it under her apron .
i saw your aunt there , said nekhludoff .
did you ?
she said , with indifference .
how do you fare here ?
asked nekhludoff .
fairly well , she said .
it is not very hard ?
not very .
i am not used to it yet .
i am very glad .
at any rate , it is better than there .
than where ?
she said , and her face became purple .
there , in the prison , nekhludoff hastened to say .
why better ?
she asked .
i think the people here are better .
there are no such people here as there .
there are many good people there .
i did what i could for the menshovs and hope they will be freed , said nekhludoff .
may god grant it .
such a wonderful little woman , she said , repeating her description of the old woman , and slightly smiled .
i am going to petersburg .
your case will be heard soon , and , i hope , will be reversed .
it is all the same now , whether they reverse it or not , she said .
why now ?
so , she answered , and stealthily glanced at him inquiringly .
nekhludoff understood this answer and this glance as a desire on her part to know if he were still holding to his decision , or had changed it since her refusal .
i do know why it is all the same to you , he said , but to me it really is all the same whether you are acquitted or not .
in either case , i am ready to do what i said , he said , with determination .
she raised her head , and her black , squinting eyes fixed themselves on his face and past it , and her whole face became radiant with joy .
but her words were in an entirely different strain .
oh , you need talk that way , she said .
i say it that you may know .
everything has been already said , and there is no use talking any more , she said , with difficulty repressing a smile .
there was some noise in the ward .
a child was heard crying .
i think i am called , she said , looking around with anxiety .
well , then , , he said .
she pretended not to see his extended hand , turned round , and endeavoring to hide her elation , she walked away with quick step .
what is taking place in her ?
what is she thinking ?
what are her feelings ?
is she putting me to a test , or is she really unable to forgive me ?
can she not say what she thinks and feels , or simply will not ?
is she pacified or angered ?
nekhludoff asked himself , but could give no answer .
one thing he knew , however , and that was that she had changed ; that a spiritual transformation was taking place in her , and this transformation united him not only to her , but to him in whose name it was taking place .
and this union caused him joyful agitation .
returning to the ward where eight children lay in their beds , maslova began to remake one of the beds , by order of the sister , and , leaning over too far with the sheet , slipped and nearly fell .
the convalescing boy , wound in bandages to his neck , began to laugh .
maslova could restrain herself no longer , and seating herself on the bedstead she burst into loud laughter , infecting several children , who also began to laugh .
the sister angrily shouted what are you roaring about ?
think you this is like the place you came from ?
go fetch the rations .
maslova stopped laughing , and taking a dish went on her errand , but exchanging looks with the bandaged boy , who giggled again .
several times during the day , when maslova remained alone , she drew out a corner of the picture and looked at it with admiration , but in the evening , when she and another nurse retired for the night , she removed the picture from the envelope and immovably looked with admiration at the faces ; her own , his and the aunt , their dresses , the stairs of the balcony , the bushes in the background , her eyes feasting especially on herself , her young , beautiful face with the hair hanging over her forehead .
she was so absorbed that she failed to notice that the other nurse had entered .
what is that ?
did he give it you ?
asked the stout , nurse , leaning over the photograph .
is it possible that that is you ?
who else ?
maslova said , smiling and looking into her face .
and who is that ?
he himself ?
and that is his mother ?
his aunt .
could you recognize me ?
asked maslova .
why , no .
i could never recognize you .
the face is entirely different .
that must have been taken about ten years ago .
not years , but a lifetime , said maslova , and suddenly her face became sullen and a wrinkle formed between her eyebrows .
yours was an easy life , was it ?
yes , easy , maslova repeated , closing her eyes and shaking her head .
worse than penal servitude .
why so ?
because .
from eight in the evening to four in the morning every day the same .
then why do they get out ?
they like to , but can not .
but what is the use of talking !
cried maslova , and she sprang to her feet , threw the photograph into the drawer of the table , and suppressing her angry tears , ran into the corridor , slamming the door .
looking on the photograph she imagined herself as she had been at the time the photograph was made , and dreamed how happy she had been and might still be with him .
the words of her companion reminded her what she was now reminded her of all the horror of that life which she then felt but confusedly , and would not allow herself to admit .
only now she vividly recalled all those terrible nights , particularly one shrovetide night .
she recalled how she , in a , , red silk dress , with a red bow in her dishevelled hair , weak , jaded and tipsy , after dancing attendance upon the guest , had seated herself , at two in the morning , near the thin , bony , pimpled and complained of her hard life .
the girl said that her life was also disagreeable to her , and that she wished to change her occupation .
afterward their friend clara joined them , and all three suddenly decided to change their life .
they were about to leave the place when the drunken guests became noisy , the fiddler struck up a lively song of the first figure of a russian quadrille , the pianist began to thump in unison , a little drunken man in a white necktie and dress coat caught her up .
another man , stout and bearded , and also in a dress coat , seized clara , and for a long time they whirled , danced , shouted and drank .
thus a year passed , a second and a third .
how could she help changing !
and the cause of it all was he .
and suddenly her former wrath against him rose in her ; and she felt like chiding and reproving him .
she was sorry that she had missed the opportunity of telling him again that she knew him , and would not yield to him ; that she would not allow him to take advantage of her spiritually as he had done corporeally ; that she would not allow him to make her the subject of his magnanimity .
and in order to deaden the painful feeling of pity for herself and the useless reprobation of him , she yearned for wine .
and she would have broken her word and drunk some wine had she been in the prison .
but here wine could only be obtained from the assistant surgeon , and she was afraid of him , because he pursued her with his attentions , and all relations with men were disgusting to her .
for some time she sat on a bench in the corridor , and returning to her closet , without heeding her companion questions , she wept for a long time over her ruined life .
nekhludoff had four cases in hand maslova appeal , the petition of theodosia birukova , the case of shustova release , by request of vera bogodukhovskaia , and the obtaining of permission for a mother to visit her son kept in a fortress , also by bogodukhovskaia request .
since his visit to maslenikoff , especially since his trip to the country , nekhludoff felt an aversion for that sphere in which he had been living heretofore , and in which the sufferings borne by millions of people in order to secure the comforts and pleasures of a few , were so carefully concealed that the people of that sphere did not and could not see these sufferings , and consequently the cruelty and criminality of their own lives .
nekhludoff could no longer keep up relations with these people without reproving himself .
and yet the habits of his past life , the ties of friendship and kinship , and especially his one great aim of helping maslova and the other unfortunates , drew him into that sphere against his will ; and he was compelled to ask the aid and services of people whom he had not only ceased to respect but who called forth his indignation and contempt .
arriving at petersburg , and stopping at his aunt , the wife of an of state , he found himself in the very heart of the aristocratic circle .
it was unpleasant to him , but he could do no different .
not to stop at his aunt was to offend her .
besides , through her connections she could be of great service to him in those affairs for the sake of which he came to petersburg .
what wonders i hear about you !
said countess catherine ivanovna charskaia , while nekhludoff was drinking the coffee brought him immediately after his arrival .
vous posez pour un howard .
you are helping the convicts ; making the rounds of the prisons ; reforming them .
you are mistaken ; i never had such intentions .
why , that is not bad .
only , i understand , there is some love affair come , tell me .
nekhludoff related the story of maslova , exactly as it happened .
yes , yes , i remember .
poor hellen told me at the time you lived at the old maids ' house that , i believe , they wished you to marry their ward .
countess catherine ivanovna always hated nekhludoff aunts on his father side .
so , that is she ?
elle est encore jolie ?
aunt catherine ivanovna was a , healthy , jolly , energetic , talkative woman .
she was tall , very stout , with a black , downy mustache on her upper lip .
nekhludoff loved her , and since childhood had been accustomed to get infected with her energy and cheerfulness .
no , ma tante , all that belongs to the past .
i only wish to help her , because she is innocent , and it is my fault that she was condemned , her whole wrecked life is upon my conscience .
i feel it to be my duty to do for her what i can .
but how is it ?
i was told that you wish to marry her .
i do wish it , it is true ; but she does .
catherine ivanovna raised her eyebrows and silently looked at nekhludoff in surprise .
suddenly her face changed and assumed a pleased expression .
well , she is wiser than you are .
ah !
what a fool you are !
and you would marry her ?
certainly .
after what she has been ?
the more so is it not all my fault ?
well , you are simply a crank , said the aunt , suppressing a smile .
you are an awful crank , but i love you for the very reason that you are such an awful crank , she repeated , the word evidently well describing , according to her view , the mental and moral condition of her nephew .
and how opportune .
you know , aline has organized a wonderful asylum for magdalens .
i visited it once .
how disgusting they are !
i afterward washed myself from head to foot .
but aline is corps et ame in this affair .
so we will send her , your magdalen , to her .
if any one will reform her , it is aline .
but she was sentenced to penal servitude .
i came here for the express purpose of obtaining a reversal of her sentence .
that is my first business to you .
is that so ?
where is the case now ?
in the senate .
in the senate ?
why , my dear cousin levoushka is in the senate .
however , he is in the heraldry department .
let me see .
no , of the real ones i do not know any .
heaven knows what a mixture they are either germans , such as ge , fe , de tout or all sorts of ivanvas , semenovs , nikitins , or ivaneukos , semeneukos , nikitenkas pour varier .
des gens de monde .
however , i will tell my husband .
he knows all sorts of people .
i will tell him .
you explain it to him , for he never understands me .
no matter what i may say , he always says that he can not understand me .
un parti pris .
everybody understands , only he does not understand .
at that moment a servant in entered with a letter on a silver tray .
ah , that is from aline .
now you will have an opportunity to hear kisiweather .
who is that kisiweather ?
kisiweather ?
come around and you will find out who he is .
he speaks so that the most hardened criminals fall on their knees and weep , and repent .
countess catherine ivanovna , however strange it might be , and how so little it agreed with her character , was a follower of that teaching which held that essence of christianity consisted in a belief in redemption .
she visited the meetings where sermons were delivered on this teaching then in vogue , and invited the adherents to her own house .
although this teaching rejected all rites , images and even the sacraments , the princess had images hanging in all her rooms , even over her bedstead , and she complied with all the ritual requirements of the church , seeing nothing contradictory in that .
your magdalen ought to hear him ; she would become converted , said the countess .
do fail to come .
you will hear him then .
he is a remarkable man .
it is not interesting to me , ma tante .
i tell you it is interesting .
you must come .
now , what else do you want me to do ?
videz votre sac .
there is the man in the fortress .
in the fortress ?
well , i can give you a note to baron kriegmuth .
un homme .
but you know him yourself .
he was your father comrade .
il donne dans le spiritisme .
but that is nothing .
he is a kind man .
what do you want there ?
it is necessary to obtain permission for a mother to visit her son who is incarcerated there .
but i was told that cherviansky and not kriegmuth is the person to be applied to .
i do not like cherviansky , but he is mariette husband .
i will ask her ; she will do it for me .
elle est très gentille .
there is another woman i wish you would speak to her about .
she has been in prison for several months , and no one knows for what .
oh , no ; she herself surely knows for what .
they know very well .
and it serves them right , those ones .
i do not know whether it serves them right or not .
but they are suffering .
you are a christian , and believe in the gospel , and yet are so pitiless .
that has nothing to do with it .
the gospel is one thing ; what i dislike is another thing .
it would be worse if i pretended to like the nihilists , especially the female nihilists , when as a matter of fact i hate them .
why do you hate them ?
why do they meddle in other people affairs ?
it is not a business .
but you have nothing against mariette occupying herself with business , said nekhludoff .
mariette ?
mariette is mariette , but who is she ?
a conceited ignoramus who wants to teach everybody .
they do not wish to teach ; they only wish to help the people .
we know without them who should and who should not be helped .
but the people are impoverished .
i have just been in the country .
is it proper that peasants should overwork themselves without getting enough to eat , while we are living in such wasteful luxury ?
what do you wish me to do ?
you would like to see me work and not eat anything ?
no , i do not wish you not to eat , smiling involuntarily , answered nekhludoff .
i only wish that we should all work , and all have enough to eat .
the aunt again raised her eyebrows and gazed at him with curiosity .
mon cher , vous finirez mal , she said .
at that moment a tall , general entered the room .
it was countess charskaia husband , a retired minister of state .
ah , dmitri , how do you do ?
he said , putting out his cheek .
when did you get here ?
he silently kissed his wife on the forehead .
non , il est impayable .
countess catherine ivanovna turned to her husband .
he wants me to do washing on the river and feast on potatoes .
he is an awful fool , but , nevertheless , do for him what he asks .
an awful crank , she corrected herself .
by the way , they say that kamenskaia is in a desperate condition ; her life is despaired of , she turned to her husband .
you ought to visit her .
yes , it is awful , said the husband .
go , now , and have a talk together ; i must write some letters .
nekhludoff had just reached the room next to the when she shouted after him shall i write then to mariette ?
if you please , ma tante .
i will learn that which you want to say about the en blanc , and she will have her husband attend to it .
do think that i am angry .
they are hateful , your protegees , but je ne leur veux pas de mal .
but god forgive them .
now , go , and do forget to come in the evening ; you will hear kisiweather .
we will also pray .
and if you do not resist , ca vous fera beaucoup de bien .
i know that hellen and all of you are very backward in that respect .
now , au revoir .
the man in whose power it was to lighten the condition of the prisoners in petersburg had earned a great number of medals , which , except for a white cross in his , he did not wear , however .
the old general was of the german barons , and , as it was said of him , had become childish .
he had served in the caucasus , where he had received this cross ; then in poland and in some other place , and now he held the office which gave him good quarters , maintenance and honor .
he always strictly carried out the orders of his superiors , and considered their execution of great importance and significance , so much so that while everything in the world could be changed , these orders , according to him , were above the possibility of any alteration .
as nekhludoff was approaching the old general house the tower clock struck two .
the general was at the time sitting with a young artist in the darkened , at a table , the top of which was of inlaid work , both of them turning a saucer on a sheet of paper .
holding each others fingers over the saucer , placed face downward , they pulled in different directions over the paper on which were printed all the letters of the alphabet .
the saucer was answering the general question .
how would souls recognize each other after death ?
at the moment one of the servants entered with nekhludoff card , the soul of jeanne was speaking through the saucer .
the soul had already said , they will recognize each other , which was duly entered on a sheet of paper .
when the servant entered , the saucer , stopping first on the letter p , then on the letter o , reached the letter s and began to jerk one way and another .
that was because , as the general thought , the next letter was to be l , that is to say , jeanne , according to his idea , intended to say that souls would recognize each other only after they had been purged of everything mundane , or something to that effect , and that therefore the next letter ought to be l ( , , after ) ; the artist , on the other hand , thought that the next letter would be v ; that the soul intended to say that souls would recognize each other by the light ( ) that would issue from the ethereal body of the souls .
the general , gloomily knitting his brow , gazed fixedly on the hands , and imagining that the saucer moved itself , pulled it toward the letter the young , anaemic artist , with his oily hair brushed behind his ears , looked into the dark corner of the room , with his blue , dull eyes , and nervously twitching his lips , pulled toward the letter the general frowned at the interruption , and , after a moment silence , took the card , put on his and , groaning from pain in his loins , rose to his full height , rubbing his benumbed fingers .
show him into the cabinet .
permit me , your excellency , to finish it myself , said the artist , rising .
i feel a presence .
very well ; finish it , said the general with austerity , and went , with firm , long strides , into the cabinet .
glad to see you , said the general in a rough voice to nekhludoff , pointing to an near the desk .
how long have you been in st .
petersburg ?
nekhludoff said that he had but lately arrived .
is your mother , the princess , well ?
my mother is dead .
beg pardon ; i was very sorry .
my son told me that he had met you .
the general son was making the same career as his father , and was very proud of the business with which he was entrusted .
why , i served with your father .
we were friends , comrades .
are you in service ?
no , i am not .
the general disapprovingly shook his head .
i have a request to make of you , general , said nekhludoff .
very glad .
what can i do for you ?
if my request be out of season , please forgive me .
but i must state it .
what is it ?
there is a man , gurkevitch , kept in prison under your jurisdiction .
his mother asks to be permitted to visit him , or , at least to send him books .
the general expressed neither satisfaction nor dissatisfaction at nekhludoff request , but , inclining his head to one side , seemed to reflect .
as a matter of fact he was not reflecting ; question did not even interest him , knowing very well that his answer would be as the law requires .
he was simply resting mentally without thinking of anything .
that is not in my discretion , you know , he said , having rested awhile .
there is a law relating to visits , and whatever that law permits , that is permitted .
and as to books , there is a library , and they are given such books as are allowed .
yes , but he wants scientific books ; he wishes to study .
do believe that .
the general paused .
it is not for study that they want them , but so , it is simply unrest .
but their time must be occupied somehow ?
they are always complaining , retorted the general .
we know them .
he spoke of them in general as of some peculiar race of people .
they have such conveniences here as is seldom seen in a prison , he continued .
and as though justifying himself , he began to recount all the conveniences enjoyed by the prisoners in a manner to make one believe that the chief aim of the institution consisted in making it a pleasant place of abode .
formerly , it is true , the regulations were very harsh , but now their condition is excellent .
they get three dishes , one of which is always of meat chopped meat or cutlet .
sundays they get a fourth dish dessert .
may god grant that every russian could feed so well .
the general , like all old men , evidently having committed to memory the words , proceeded to prove how exacting and ungrateful the prisoners were by repeating what he had told many times before .
they are furnished books on spiritual topics , also old journals .
we have a library of suitable books , but they seldom read them .
at first they appear to be interested , and then it is found that the pages of all the new books are barely half cut , and of the old ones there is no evidence of any at all .
we even tried , with a remote semblance of a smile the general continued , to put a piece of paper between the pages , and it remained untouched .
writing , too , is allowed .
a slate is given them , also a , so that they may write for diversion .
they can wipe it out and write again .
and yet they do write .
no , they become quiet very soon .
at first they are uneasy , but afterward they even grow stout and become very quiet .
nekhludoff listened to the hoarse , feeble voice ; looked on that fleshless body , those faded eyes under the gray eyebrows , those sunken , shaved cheeks , supported by a military collar , that white cross , and understood that to argue and explain to him the meaning of those words were futile .
but , making another effort , he asked him about the prisoner , shustova , whose release , he had received information , had been ordered , through the efforts of mariette .
shustova ?
shustova i do remember them all by name .
there are so many of them , he said , evidently reproving them for being so numerous .
he rang the bell and called for the secretary .
while a servant was going after the secretary he admonished nekhludoff to go into service , saying that the country was in need of honest , noble men .
i am old , and yet i am serving to the extent of my ability .
the secretary came and reported that there were no papers received relating to shustova , who was still in prison .
as soon as we receive an order we release them the very same day .
we do not keep them ; we do not particularly value their presence , said the general , again with a waggish smile , which had the effect only of making his face wry .
, my dear , he continued .
do be offended for advising you , for i do so only because i love you .
have nothing to do with the prisoners .
you will never find innocent people among them .
they are the most immoral set .
we know them , he said , in a tone of voice which did not permit the possibility of doubt .
you had better take an office .
the emperor and the country need honest people .
what if i and such as you refused to serve ?
who would be left ?
we are complaining of conditions , but refuse to aid the government .
nekhludoff sighed deeply , made a low bow , pressed the bony hand condescendingly extended , and departed .
the general disapprovingly shook his head , and , rubbing his loins , went to the , where the artist awaited him with the answer of jeanne .
the general put on his and read they will recognize each other by the light issuing from the ethereal bodies .
ah !
said the general , approvingly , closing his eyes .
but how will one recognize another when all have the same light ?
he asked , and again crossing his fingers with those of the artist , seated himself at the table .
nekhludoff driver drove up to the gate .
it is very dull here , sir , he said , turning to nekhludoff .
it was very tiresome , and i was about to drive away .
yes , tiresome , assented nekhludoff with a deep sigh , resting his eyes on the clouds and the neva , dotted with variegated boats and steamers .
with a note from prince ivan michaelovitch , nekhludoff went to senator wolf un homme très comme il faut , as the prince had described him .
wolf had just breakfasted and , as usual , was smoking a cigar , to aid his digestion , when nekhludoff arrived .
vladimir vasilievitch wolf was really un homme très comme il faut , and this quality he placed above all else ; from the height of it he looked upon all other people , and could not help valuing this quality , because , thanks to it , he had gained a brilliant career the same career he strove for ; that is to say , through marriage he obtained a fortune , which brought him a yearly income of eighteen thousand rubles , and by his own efforts he obtained a senatorship .
he considered himself not only un homme très comme il faut , but a man of chivalric honesty .
by honesty he understood the refusal to take bribes from private people .
but to do everything in his power to obtain all sorts of traveling expenses , rents and disbursements he did not consider dishonest .
nor did he consider it dishonest to rob his wife and of their fortunes .
on the contrary , he considered that a wise arrangement of his family affairs .
the home circle of vladimir vasilievitch consisted of his characterless wife , her sister , whose fortune he managed to get into his own hands by selling her property and depositing the money in his own name , and his gentle , scared , homely daughter , who was leading a solitary , hard life , and whose only diversion consisted in visiting the religious meetings at aline and countess catherine ivanovna .
the son of vladimir vasilievitch , a , bearded boy of fifteen , who at that age had already commenced to drink and lead a depraved life which lasted till he was twenty years old , was driven from the house for the reason that he did not pass examinations in any school , and keeping bad company , and , running into debt , he had compromised his father .
the father paid once for his son two hundred and thirty rubles , and paid six hundred rubles a second time , but declared that that was the last time , and if the son did not reform he would drive him from the house and have nothing to do with him .
not only did the son not reform , but contracted another debt of a thousand rubles , and told his father that he did not care if he was driven from the house , since life at home was torture to him .
then vladimir vasilievitch told his son that he could go where he pleased ; that he was no longer his son .
since then no one in the house dared to speak of his son to him .
and vladimir vasilievitch was quite certain that he had arranged his family affairs in the best possible manner .
wolf , with a flattering and somewhat derisive smile it was an involuntary expression of his consciousness of his comme il faut superiority halted in his exercise long enough to greet nekhludoff and read the note .
please take a seat , but you must excuse me .
if you have no objection i will walk , he said , putting his hands in the pockets of his jacket , and treading lightly up and down the diagonal of the large cabinet , furnished in an austere style .
very glad to make your acquaintance , and , of course , to please the count ivan michaelovitch , emitting the fragrant , blue smoke , and carefully removing the cigar from his mouth so as not to lose the ashes .
i would like to ask you to hasten the hearing of the appeal , because if the prisoner is to go to siberia , it would be desirable that she go as soon as possible , said nekhludoff .
yes , yes , with the first steamer from nijhni ; i know , said wolf , with his condescending smile , who always knew everything in advance , whatever the subject mentioned to him .
what is the name of the prisoner ?
maslova .
wolf walked to the table and looked into the papers .
that right maslova .
very well ; i will ask my associates .
we will hear the case wednesday .
may i wire my lawyer ?
so you have a lawyer ?
what for ?
but if you wish it , all right .
the grounds of appeal may be insufficient , said nekhludoff , but i think it may be seen from the case that the sentence was the result of a misunderstanding .
yes , yes ; that may be so , but the senate can not enter into the merits of the case , said vladimir vasilievitch , sternly , glancing at the ashes of his cigar .
the senate only looks after the proper interpretation and application of the law .
this , i think , is an exceptional case .
i know ; i know .
all cases are exceptional .
we will do what the law requires .
that is all .
the ashes were still intact , but had already cracked and were in danger of collapse .
and do you often visit st .
petersburg ?
asked wolf , holding the cigar so that the ashes would not fall .
the ashes were unstable , however , and wolf carefully carried them to the , into which they were finally precipitated .
what an awful catastrophe kamensky met with , said wolf .
a fine young man , and an only son .
especially the condition of the mother he went on repeating almost word for word the story of a duel of which all petersburg was talking at the time .
after a few more words about countess catherine ivanovna and her passion for the new religious tendency which vladimir vasilievitch neither praised nor condemned , but which , for un homme très comme il faut , was evidently superfluous , he rang the bell .
nekhludoff bowed himself out .
if it is convenient for you , come to dinner , said wolf , extending his hand , say on wednesday .
i will then give you a definite answer .
it was already late , and nekhludoff drove home , that is , to his aunt .
maslova case was to be heard the following day , and nekhludoff went to the senate .
he met fanirin at the entrance to the magnificent senate building , where several carriages were already waiting .
walking up the grand , solemn staircase to the second floor , the lawyer , who was familiar with all the passages , turned into a room to the left , on the door of which was carved the year of the institution of the code .
the lawyer removed his overcoat , remaining in his and black tie on a white bosom , and with cheerful walked into the next room .
there were about fifteen spectators present , among whom were a young woman in a , and a lady .
a old man of patriarchal mien , wearing a and gray trousers , and attended by two men , attracted particular attention .
he crossed the room and entered a wardrobe .
an usher , a handsome man with red cheeks and in a pompous uniform , approached fanirin with a piece of paper in his hand and asked him in what case he appeared .
being told that in maslova case , the usher made a note of something and went away .
at that time the door of the wardrobe opened and the patriarchal looking old man came forth , no longer in the coat , but in a brilliant uniform which made him resemble a bird .
his uniform evidently embarrassed the old man , and he walked into the room opposite the entrance with quicker than his ordinary step .
fanirin pointed him out to nekhludoff as bé , a most honorable gentleman .
the spectators , including fanirin , went into the next room and seated themselves behind the grating on benches reserved for spectators .
only the petersburg lawyer took a seat behind a desk on the other side of the grating .
the session room of the senate was smaller than the room of the circuit court , was furnished in simpler style , only the table behind which the senators sat was of crimson plush instead of green cloth , bordered with gold lace .
there were four senators .
the president , nikitin , with a closely shaved , narrow face and eyes ; wolf , with thin lips and small white hands , with which he was turning over the papers before him ; then skovorodnikoff , stout , massive and , and a very learned jurist , and finally , bé , the same partriarchal old man , who was the last to arrive .
immediately behind the senators came the chief secretary and associate attorney general .
he was a young man of medium height , shaved , lean , with a very dark face and black , sad eyes .
nekhludoff recognized him , notwithstanding his strange uniform and the fact that he had not seen him for about six years , as one of his best friends during his student life .
is the associate name selenin ?
he asked the lawyer .
yes , why ?
i know him very well ; he is an excellent man and a good associate of the attorney general very sensible .
it would have been well to see him , said fanirin .
at all events , he will follow the dictates of his conscience , said nekhludoff , remembering his close relations with and friendship for selenin , and the latter charming qualities of purity , honesty and good breeding , in the best sense of the word .
the first case before the senate was an appeal from the decision of the circuit court of appeals affirming a judgment in favor of the publisher of a newspaper in a libel suit brought against him .
nekhludoff listened and tried to understand the arguments in the case , but as in the circuit court , the chief difficulty in understanding what was going on was found in the fact that the discussion centered not on what appeared naturally to be the main point , but on side issues .
the libel consisted in an article accusing the president of a stock company of swindling .
it seemed , then , that the main point to consider was , whether or not the president was guilty of swindling the stockholders , and what was to be done to stop his swindling .
but this was never mentioned .
the questions discussed were had the publisher the legal right to print the article of its reporter ?
what crime has he committed by printing it defamation or libel ?
and does defamation include libel , or libel defamation ?
and a number of other things unintelligible to ordinary people , including various laws and decisions of some general department .
the only thing nekhludoff did understand was that , though wolf had sternly suggested but yesterday that the senate could not consider the substance of a case , in the case at bar he argued with evident partiality in favor of reversing the judgment , and that selenin , in spite of his characteristic reserve , argued in favor of affirming the judgment with unexpected fervor .
the cause of selenin ardor lay in the fact that he knew the president of the stock company to be dishonest in money affairs , while he accidentally learned that wolf , almost on the eve of the hearing of the case , had attended a sumptuous dinner at the president house .
and now , when wolf , though with great caution , showed undoubted partiality , selenin became excited and expressed his opinion with more nervousness than an ordinary case would justify .
wolf was evidently offended by the speech ; he twitched nervously , changed color , made silent gestures of wonder , and with an haughty air of being offended he departed with the other senators into the .
what case are you interested in ?
the usher again asked fanirin , as soon as the senators had left the room .
i have already told you that i am here in behalf of maslova .
that is so .
the case will be heard .
but what is that ?
asked the lawyer .
you see , the case was to be argued without counsel , so that the senators would hardly consider it in open session .
but i will announce and he made a note on the piece of paper .
the senators really intended , after announcing their decision in the libel case , to consider the other cases , including maslova , while drinking their tea and smoking cigarettes in the .
as soon as the senators seated themselves at the table in the , wolf began to set forth in an animated manner the grounds upon which he thought the case ought to be reversed .
the president , always an man , was in a particularly bad humor .
while listening to the case during the session he formed his opinion , and sat , absorbed in his thoughts , without listening to wolf .
these thoughts consisted in a recollection of what note he had made the other day in his memoirs anent the appointment of velianoff to an important post which he desired for himself .
the president , nikitin , quite sincerely thought that the officials with whom his duties brought him in contact were worthy of a place in history .
having written an article the other day in which some of these officials were vehemently denounced for interfering with his plan to save russia from ruin , as he put it , but in reality for interfering with his getting a larger salary than he was now getting , he was now thinking that posterity would give an entirely new interpretation to that incident .
why , certainly , he said to wolf , who was addressing him , although he did not hear what wolf said .
bé listened to wolf with a sad face , drawing garlands on a piece of paper which lay before him .
bé was a liberal of the deepest dye .
he scarcely held to the traditions of the sixties , and if he ever deviated from strict impartiality , it was invariably in favor of liberality .
thus , in this case , besides the consideration that the complaining president of the stock company was an unclean man , bé was in favor of affirming the judgment , also because this charge of libel against a journalist was a restriction on the freedom of the press .
when wolf had finished his argument , bé , leaving the garland unfinished , in a sad it was sad for him to be obliged to prove such truisms soft , pleasant voice , convincingly proved in a few simple words that the charge had no foundation , and , again drooping his hoary head , continued to complete the garland .
skovorodnikoff , who was sitting opposite wolf , continually gathering with his thick fingers his beard and mustache into his mouth , as soon as bé was through with his argument , stopped chewing his beard , and , in a loud , rasping voice , said that although the president of the stock company was a villain , he should favor a reversal if there were legal grounds to sustain it , but as there were none , he joined in the opinion of ivan semenovitch ( bé ) , and he invariably rejoiced at this shot aimed at wolf .
the president supported skovorodnikoff opinion , and the judgment was confirmed .
wolf was dissatisfied , especially because by this judgment he seemed to stand convicted of arguing in bad faith ; but , feigning indifference , he opened his papers in the next case , maslova , and began to peruse it attentively .
the other senators in the meantime called for tea , and began a talk about kamensky duel and his death , which was then the subject of conversation throughout the city .
the usher entered and announced the desire of the lawyer and nekhludoff to be present at the hearing of the case .
this case here , said wolf , is a whole romantic story , and he related what he knew of nekhludoff relations to maslova .
after talking awhile of the story , smoking cigarettes and finishing their tea , the senators returned to the , announced their decision in the preceding case , and began to consider maslova case .
wolf very circumstantially set forth maslova appeal from the sentence , and again not without partiality , but with the evident desire to reverse the judgment .
have you anything to add ?
the president asked fanirin .
fanirin rose , and , projecting his broad , starched front , with remarkable precision of expression began to discuss the errors of the court below in the application of the law on the six points raised , and permitted himself , though briefly , to touch upon the merits of the case and the crying injustice of the decision .
by the tone of his short but strong speech , he seemed to excuse himself , to insist that the honorable senators with their power of penetration and judicial wisdom saw and understood better than he , but that he was speaking only because his duties demanded it .
after fanirin speech there seemed to be no doubt left that the senate had to reverse the judgment .
when he was through , fanirin smiled triumphantly .
looking at his lawyer and seeing that smile , nekhludoff was convinced that the case was won .
but as he looked at the senators nekhludoff saw that fanirin alone was smiling and triumphant .
the senators and associate attorney general were neither smiling nor triumphant , but wore the air of people suffering from ennui and saying oh , we know these cases !
you are wasting your time .
they were all evidently relieved only when the lawyer had finished , and they were no longer unnecessarily detained .
after the speech the president turned to selenin , who plainly , briefly and accurately expressed himself against a reversal .
then the senators arose and went to consult .
the senators were divided .
wolf favored a reversal .
bé , who thoroughly understood the case , warmly argued also in favor of a reversal , and in glowing terms pictured the court scene and the misunderstanding of the jury .
nikitin , who , as usual , stood for severity and for strict formality , was against it .
the whole case , then , depended on skovorodnikoff vote .
and his vote was thrown against a reversal , principally for the reason that nekhludoff determination to marry the girl on moral grounds was extremely repugnant to him .
skovorodnikoff was a materialist , a darwinist , and considered every manifestation of abstract morality , or , worse still , piety , not only as contemptible and absurd but as an affront to his person .
all this bustle about a fallen girl , and the presence there in the senate of her famous counsel and nekhludoff himself , was to him simply disgusting .
and , stuffing his mouth with his beard , and making grimaces , he in a very natural manner pretended to know nothing of the entire affair , except that the grounds of appeal were insufficient , and therefore agreed with the president to affirm the judgment .
the appeal was denied .
it is awful !
said nekhludoff to the lawyer , as they entered the .
in the plainest possible case they cavil at idle forms .
it is awful !
the case was spoiled at the trial , said fanirin .
selenin , too , was against reversal .
it is awful , awful !
nekhludoff continued to repeat .
what is to be done now ?
we will petition the emperor .
head it yourself while you are here .
i will prepare the petition .
at that moment wolf in his uniform and stars hung on his breast entered the and approached nekhludoff .
i am sorry , my dear prince , but the grounds were insufficient , he said , shrugging his narrow shoulders ; and , closing his eyes , he proceeded on his way .
after wolf came selenin , who had learned from the senators that nekhludoff , his former friend , was present .
i did not expect to meet you here , he said , approaching nekhludoff and smiling with his lips , while his eyes remained sad .
and i did not know that you were the attorney general .
associate , selenin corrected him .
but what brought you to the senate ?
i came here hoping to find justice , and to save an innocent woman .
what woman ?
the case that has just been decided .
oh , the maslova case !
said selenin .
an entirely groundless appeal .
the question is not of the appeal , but of the woman , who is innocent and undergoing punishment .
selenin sighed .
quite possible , but it is not merely possible , but certain .
how do you know ?
i know because i was on the jury .
i know wherein we made the mistake .
selenin became thoughtful .
it should have been declared on the trial , he said .
i did so .
it should have been made part of the record .
if that had appeared in the appeal selenin , who was always busy , and did not mingle in society , had evidently not heard of nekhludoff romance .
nekhludoff , however , decided not to speak to him of his relations to maslova .
but it is evident even now that the verdict was preposterous , he said .
the senate has no right to say so .
if the senate attempted to interfere with the verdicts of the courts upon its own view of the justness of the verdicts themselves , there would be greater risks of justice being miscarried than established , he said , recalling the preceding case .
besides , the verdicts of juries would lose their significance .
i only know one thing , and that is that the woman is entirely innocent , and the last hope of saving her from an undeserved punishment is gone .
the highest judicial institution has affirmed what was absolutely unjust .
it has not affirmed because it has not and could not consider the merits of the case , said selenin , blinking his eyes .
you have probably stopped at your aunts , he added , evidently wishing to change the subject of conversation .
i learned yesterday that you were in petersburg .
countess catherine ivanovna had invited me and you to be present at the meeting of the english preacher , said selenin , smiling only with his lips .
yes , i was present , but left with disgust , nekhludoff said angrily , vexed at selenin leading away from the conversation .
why should you be disgusted ?
at all events it is a manifestation of religious feeling , although and sectarian , said selenin .
it is such strange nonsense , said nekhludoff .
well , no .
the only strange thing here is that we know so little of the teachings of our church that we receive an exposition of its fundamental dogmas as a new revelation , said selenin , as though hastening to tell his former friends his new views .
nekhludoff gazed at selenin with wonder .
selenin did not lower his eyes , in which there was an expression not only of sadness , but of .
but we will discuss it later , said selenin .
i am coming , he turned to the usher who approached him deferentially .
we must meet again , he added , sighing ; but you can never be found .
you will always find me at home at seven .
i live on nadeghinskaia , and he mentioned the number .
it is a long time since we met , he added , again smiling with his lips .
i will come if i have the time , said nekhludoff , feeling that the man whom he had once loved was made strange and incomprehensible to him , if not hostile , by this short conversation .
as student nekhludoff knew selenin as a dutiful son , a true friend , and , for his years , an educated , worldly man , with great tact , always elegant and handsome , and uncommonly truthful and honest withal .
he studied diligently , without any difficulty and without the slightest ostentation , receiving gold medals for his compositions .
he had made it the aim of his young life , not merely by word , but in reality , to serve others , and thought he saw his chance of doing so in government service .
systematically looking over the various activities to which he might devote his energies , he decided that he could be most useful in the legislative department , and entered it .
but notwithstanding his most accurate and conscientious attention to his duties , he found nothing in them to satisfy his desire to be useful .
his discontent , due to the pettiness and vanity of his immediate superiors , grew until an opportunity offered to enter the senate .
he was better off in the senate , but the same feeling of dissatisfaction pursued him .
he constantly felt that things were not what he expected them to be , and what they should be .
during his service in the senate , his relations obtained for him the post of gentleman of the , and he was obliged to drive around in gorgeous uniform to thank various people .
in this post he felt even more than before out of place .
at the same time , on the one hand , he could not refuse the appointment , because he would not disappoint those who thought they were pleasing him by it , and , on the other hand , the appointment flattered his vanity .
it pleased him to see himself in a in a gold embroidered uniform , and to receive the tokens of respect shown him by some people on his appointment .
the same thing happened with respect to his marriage .
a brilliant match was arranged for him , as it is regarded from the standpoint .
and he married principally because to refuse would have been to offend and cause pain to the bride and those who had arranged the match .
hence the marriage to a young , pretty , distinguished girl flattered his vanity and gave him pleasure .
but the marriage soon turned out to be not the thing , you know , more so even than court service .
after her first child , his wife did not wish to have any more , and plunged into luxurious social life , in which he was obliged to participate nolens volens .
although this poisoned the life of her husband , and brought her only exertion and fatigue , she nevertheless diligently pursued it .
all his efforts to change her mode of life could not alter her confidence , supported by all her relatives and acquaintances , that it was quite proper .
the child , a girl with long , golden curls , was an entire stranger to her father , mainly because she was brought up not in accord with his desires .
the result was the customary misunderstanding between the husband and wife , and even in a want of desire to understand each other , and a quiet , silent struggle , hidden from strangers and tempered by propriety , which made selenin life at home very burdensome .
so that his family life turned out to be not the thing , you know , in still greater degree than his service or the court appointment .
these were the reasons why his eyes were always sad .
and this was why , seeing nekhludoff , whom he had known before all these lies had fastened themselves upon him , he thought of himself as he had been then , and more than ever felt the discord between his character and his surroundings , and he became painfully sad .
the same feeling came over nekhludoff , after the first impression of joy at meeting an old friend .
that was why , having promised that they would meet each other , neither sought that meeting , nor had they seen each other on this visit of nekhludoff to petersburg .
on leaving the senate , nekhludoff and his lawyer walked along the sidewalk .
fanirin told his driver to follow him , and he began to relate to nekhludoff how the mistress of had made millions on , how had sold , and another had bought , his wife .
he also related some stories of swindling and all sorts of crimes committed by people who were not occupying cells in prison , but presidents ' chairs in various institutions .
these stories , of which he seemed to possess an inexhaustible source , afforded the lawyer great pleasure , as showing most conclusively that the means employed by him as a lawyer to make money were perfectly innocent in comparison with those used by the more noted public men of petersburg .
and the lawyer was greatly surprised when nekhludoff , in the middle of one of these stories , hailed a trap , took leave and drove home .
nekhludoff was very sad .
he was sad because the judgment continued the unreasonable suffering of the innocent maslova , and also because it made it more difficult for him to carry out his unalterable intention of joining his fate to hers .
his sadness increased as the lawyer related with so much pleasure the frightful stories of the prevailing wickedness .
besides , the unkind , cold , repelling gaze of the once charming , and noble selenin constantly recurred to his mind .
nekhludoff , after the impressions of his stay in petersburg , was almost in despair of ever reaching any results .
all the plans he had laid out in moskow seemed to him like those youthful dreams which usually end in disappointment .
however , he considered it his duty , while in petersburg , to exhaust his resources in endeavoring to fulfill his mission .
soon after he reached his room , a servant called him upstairs for tea .
mariette , in a dress , was sitting beside the countess , sipping tea .
on nekhludoff entering the room , mariette had just dropped some funny , indecent joke .
nekhludoff noticed it by the character of their laughter .
the , mustached countess catherine ivanovna was shaking in all her stout body with laughter , while mariette , with a particularly mischievous expression , and her energetic and cheerful face somewhat bent to one side , was silently looking at her companion .
you will be the death of me , said the countess , in a fit of coughing .
no sooner had nekhludoff seated himself than mariette , noticing the serious and slightly displeased expression on his face , immediately changed not only her expression , but her frame of mind .
this was with the intention she had in mind since she first saw him to get him to like her .
she suddenly became grave , dissatisfied with her life , seeking something , striving after something .
she not merely feigned , but actually induced in herself a state of mind similar to that in which nekhludoff was , although she would not be able to say what it consisted of .
in a sympathetic conversation about the injustice of the strong , the poverty of the people , the awful condition of the prisoners , she succeeded in rousing in him the least expected feeling of physical attraction , and under the din of conversation their eyes plainly queried , can you love me ?
and they answered , yes , i can .
on leaving , she told him that she was always ready to be of service to him , and asked him to visit her at the theatre the next day , if only for a minute , saying that she wished to have a talk with him on a matter of importance .
when will i see you again ?
she added , sighing , and carefully putting the gloves on her hand .
tell me that you will come .
nekhludoff promised to come .
for a long time that night nekhludoff could not fall asleep .
when he recalled maslova , the decision of the senate , and his determination to follow her ; when he recalled his relinquishment of his right to the land , there suddenly appeared before him , as if in answer to these questions , the face of mariette ; her sigh and glance when she said , when will i see you again ?
and her smile all so distinct that she seemed to stand before him , and he smiled himself .
would it be proper for me to follow her to siberia ?
and would it be proper to deprive myself of my property ?
he asked himself .
and the answers to these questions on that bright petersburg night were indefinite .
his mind was all in confusion .
he called forth his former trend of thought , but those thoughts had lost their former power of conviction .
and what if all my ideas are due to an imagination , and i should be unable to live up to them ?
if i should repent of what i have done ?
he asked himself , and , being unable to find answers to these questions , he was stricken with such sadness and despair as he had rarely experienced before , and he fell into that deep slumber which had been habitual with him after heavy losses at cards .
nekhludoff first feeling on rising the following morning was that he had committed something abominable the preceding evening .
he began to recall what had happened .
there was nothing abominable ; he had done nothing wrong .
he had only thought that all his present intentions that of marrying katiousha , giving the land to the peasants artificial , unnatural , and that he must continued to live as he had lived before .
he could recall no wrong act , but he remembered what was worse than a wrong act there were the bad thoughts in which all bad acts have their origin .
bad acts may not be repeated ; one may repent of them , while bad thoughts give birth to bad acts .
a bad act only smooths the way to other bad acts , while bad thoughts irresistibly lead toward them .
recalling his thoughts of the day before , nekhludoff wondered how he could have believed them .
how so novel and difficult might be that which he intended to do , he knew that it was the only life possible to him now , and that , however easy it might be for him to return to his old mode of life , he knew that that was death , not life .
this temptation of the day before was similar to that of a man who , after a night sound sleep , feels like taking his ease on the soft mattress for a while , although he knows that it is time to be up and away on an important affair .
nekhludoff would have left the same evening but for his promise to mariette to visit her at the theatre .
though he knew that it was wrong to do it , he went there , contrary to the dictates of his own conscience , considering himself bound to keep his word .
besides his wish to see mariette again , he also wished , as he thought , to measure himself against that world lately so near , but now so strange to him .
could i withstand these temptations ?
he thought , but not with entire sincerity .
i will try it for the last time .
attired in a , he arrived in the theatre where the eternal dame aux camelias was being played .
a french actress was showing in a novel way how consumptive women die .
nekhludoff was shown to the box occupied by mariette .
in the corridor a liveried servant bowed and opened the door for him .
all the spectators in the circle of boxes sitting and standing , , bald and pomaded heads were intently following the movements of a slim actress making wry faces and in an unnatural voice reading a monologue .
some one hissed when the door was opened , and two streams of cold and warm air were wafted on nekhludoff face .
in the box he found mariette and a strange lady with a red mantle over her shoulders and high , and two men a general , husband , a handsome , tall man with a high , artificial , military breast , and a flaxen haired , man with shaved chin and solemn .
mariette , graceful , slim , elegant , decolette , with her strong , muscular shoulders sloping down from the neck , at the jointure of which was a darkening little mole , immediately turned around , and , pointing with her fan to a chair behind her , greeted him with a welcome , grateful , and , as it seemed to nekhludoff , significant smile .
her husband calmly , as was his wont , looked at nekhludoff and bowed his head .
in the glance which he exchanged with his wife , as in everything else , he looked the master , the owner , of a beautiful woman .
there was a thunder of applause when the monologue ended .
mariette rose , and , holding in one hand her rustling silk skirt , walked to the rear of the box and introduced nekhludoff to her husband .
the general incessantly smiled with his eyes , said he was glad , and remained calm and mute .
i had to leave , but i promised you , said nekhludoff , turning to mariette .
if you do wish to see me , you will see a remarkable actress , mariette said , answering the meaning of his words .
was she great in the last scene ?
she turned to her husband .
the general bowed his head .
that does not affect me , said nekhludoff .
i have seen so much real misfortune that sit down and tell us what you have seen .
the husband listened , and ironically smiled with his eyes .
i went to see that woman who has been released .
she is entirely broken down .
that is the woman of whom i have spoken to you , mariette said to her husband .
yes ; i was very glad that she could be released , he calmly said , nodding his head and smiling ironically , as it seemed to nekhludoff , under his mustache .
i will go to the .
nekhludoff waited , expecting that mariette would tell him that something which she said she had to tell him , but instead she only jested and talked of the performance , which , she thought , ought to affect him particularly .
nekhludoff understood that the only purpose for which she had brought him to the theatre was to display her evening toilet with her shoulders and mole , and he was both pleased and disgusted .
now he saw what was under the veil of the charm that at first attracted him .
looking on mariette , he admired her , but he knew that she was a prevaricator who was living with her husband ; that what she had said the other day was untrue , and that she only wished and neither knew why to make him love her .
and , as has been said , he was both pleased and disgusted .
several times he attempted to leave , took his hat but still remained .
but finally , when the general , his thick mustache reeking with tobacco , returned to the box and glanced at nekhludoff patronizingly disdainful , as if he did not recognize him , nekhludoff walked out before the door closed behind the general , and , finding his overcoat , left the theatre .
on his way home he suddenly noticed before him a tall , , woman .
every turned to look at her .
nekhludoff walked quicker than the woman , and also involuntarily looked her in the face .
her face , probably rouged , was pretty ; her eyes flashed at him , and she smiled .
nekhludoff involuntarily thought of mariette , for he experienced the same feeling of attraction and disgust which took hold of him in the theatre .
passing her hastily , nekhludoff turned the corner of the street , and , to the surprise of the policeman , began to walk up and down the .
that one in the theatre also smiled that way when i entered , he thought , and the smile of the former conveyed the same meaning as that of the latter .
the only difference between them is that this one speaks openly and plainly , while the other pretends to be exercising higher and refined feelings .
but in reality they are alike .
this one is at least truthful , while the other is lying .
nekhludoff recalled his relations with the wife of the district commander , and a flood of shameful recollections came upon him .
there is a disgusting bestiality in man , he thought ; but when it is in a primitive state , one looks down upon and despises it , whether he is carried away with or withstands it .
but when this same bestiality hides itself under a aesthetic , poetic cover , and demands to be worshiped , then , deifying the beast , one gives himself up to it , without distinguishing between the good and the bad .
then it is horrible .
as there was no soothing , darkness that night , but instead there was a hazy , cheerless , unnatural light , so even was there no darkness ignorance for nekhludoff soul .
everything was clear .
it was plain that all that is considered important and useful is really insignificant and wicked , and that all that splendor and luxury were hiding old crimes , familiar to every one , and not only stalking unpunished , but triumphing and adorned with all the allurements man is capable of conceiving .
nekhludoff wished to forget it , not to see it , but he could no longer help seeing it .
although he did not see the source of the light which revealed these things to him , as he did not see the source of the light which spread over petersburg , and though this light seemed to him hazy , cheerless and unnatural , he could not help seeing that which the light revealed to him , and he felt at the same time both joy and alarm .
immediately upon his arrival in moskow , nekhludoff made his way to the prison hospital , intending to make known to maslova the decision and to tell her to prepare for the journey to siberia .
of the petition which he brought for maslova signature , he had little hope .
and , strange to say , he no longer wished to succeed .
he had accustomed himself to the thought of going to siberia , and living among the exiles and convicts , and it was difficult for him to imagine how he should order his life and that of maslova if she were freed .
the at the hospital , recognizing nekhludoff , immediately informed him that maslova was no longer there .
where is she , then ?
why , again in the prison .
why was she transferred ?
asked nekhludoff .
your excellency knows their kind , said the , with a contemptuous smile .
she was making love to the assistant , so the chief physician sent her back .
nekhludoff did not suspect that maslova and her spiritual condition were so close to him .
this news stunned him .
the feeling he experienced was akin to that which people experience when hearing suddenly of some great misfortune .
he was deeply grieved .
the first feeling he experienced was that of shame .
his joyful portraying of her spiritual awakening now seemed to him ridiculous .
her reluctance to accept his sacrifice , the reproaches and the tears , were the mere cunning , he thought , of a dissolute woman who wished to make the most use of him .
it seemed to him now that at his last visit he had seen in her the symptoms of incorrigibility which were now evident .
all this flashed through his mind at the time he instinctively donned his hat and left the hospital .
but what to be done now ?
he asked himself .
am i bound to her ?
am i not released now by this , her act ?
but no sooner did he form the question than he understood that in considering himself released and leaving her to her fate he would be punishing not her , which he desired , but himself , and he was terrified .
no !
that will not alter my decision it will only strengthen it .
let her do whatever her soul prompts her to do ; if she would make love to the assistant , let her do so .
it is her business .
it is my business to do what my conscience demands , he said to himself .
and my conscience demands that i sacrifice my liberty in expiation of my sin , and my decision to marry her , although but fictitiously , and follow her wherever she may be sent , remains unaltered , he said to himself , with spiteful obstinacy , and , leaving the hospital , he made his way with resolute step to the prison gate .
coming to the gate , he asked the officer on duty to tell the inspector that he wished to see maslova .
the officer knew nekhludoff , and told him an important piece of prison news .
the captain had resigned , and another man , who was very strict , had taken his place .
the inspector , who was in the prison at the time , soon made his appearance .
he was tall , bony , very slow in his movements , and gloomy .
visitors are allowed only on certain days , he said , without looking at nekhludoff .
but i have a petition here which she must sign .
you may give it to me .
i must see the prisoner myself .
i was always permitted to see her before .
that was before , said the inspector , glancing at nekhludoff .
i have a pass from the governor , nekhludoff insisted , producing his .
let me see it , said the inspector , without looking in eyes , and taking the document with his skinny , long , white hand , on the index finger of which there was a gold ring , he slowly read it .
walk into the office , please , he said .
on this occasion there was no one in the office .
the inspector seated himself at the table , looking through the papers that lay on it , evidently intending to stay through the meeting .
when nekhludoff asked him if bogodukhovskaia could be seen , he answered visiting the politicals is not allowed , and again buried his head in the papers .
when maslova entered the room , the inspector raised his eyes , and , without looking either at maslova or nekhludoff , said you may go ahead , and continued to busy himself with his papers .
maslova was again dressed in a white skirt , waist and .
coming near nekhludoff and seeing his cold , angry face , her own turned a purple color , and , with downcast eyes , she began to pick a corner of her waist .
her confusion nekhludoff considered as confirmation of the hospital porter words .
so abhorent was she to him now that he extend his hand to her , as he desired .
illustration .
i bring you bad news , he said in an even voice , without looking at her .
the senate affirmed the verdict .
i knew it would be so , she said in a strange voice , as if choking .
if it had happened before , nekhludoff would have asked her why she knew it ; now he only looked at her .
her eyes were filled with tears , but this not only did not soften him , but made him even more inflamed against her .
the inspector rose and began to walk up and down the room .
notwithstanding the abhorence nekhludoff felt for maslova , he thought it proper to express his regret at the senate action .
do not despair , he said .
this petition may be more successful , and i hope that oh , it is not that , she said , looking at him with the tearful and squinting eyes .
what , then ?
you have been in the hospital , and they must have told you there about me .
what of it ?
that is your business , frowning , nekhludoff said with indifference .
the cruel feeling of offended pride rose in him with greater force at her mention of the hospital .
i , a man of the world , whom any girl of the upper class would be only too happy to marry , offered to become the husband of that woman , and she could not wait , but made love to the assistant surgeon , he thought , looking at her with hatred .
sign this petition , he said , and , taking from his pocket a large envelope , placed it on the table .
she wiped her tears with a corner of her , seated herself at the table , and asked him where to sign .
he showed her where , and she , seating herself , smoothed with her left hand the sleeve of the right .
he stood over her , silently looking at her back bent over the table , and now and then shaking from the sobs she tried to suppress , and his soul was convulsed by a struggle between good and evil , between offended pride and pity for her sufferings .
the feeling of pity conquered .
whether it was the feeling of pity that first asserted itself , or the recollection of his own deeds of the same character for which he reproached her , he scarcely knew , but suddenly he felt himself guilty and pitied her .
having signed the petition and wiped her soiled fingers on her skirt , she rose and glanced at him .
whatever the result , and no matter what happens , i shall keep my word , said nekhludoff .
the thought that he was forgiving her strengthened in him the feeling of pity and tenderness for her , and he wished to console her .
i will do what i said .
i will be with you wherever you may be .
that no use , she hastened to say , and her face became radiant .
make note of what you need for the road .
nothing particular , i think .
thank you .
the inspector approached them , and nekhludoff , without waiting to be told that the time was up , took leave of her , experiencing a new feeling of quiet happiness , calmness and love for all mankind .
it was the consciousness that no act of maslova could alter his love for her that raised his spirit and made him feel happy .
let her make love to the assistant that was her business .
he loved her not for himself , but for her and for god .
the for which maslova was expelled from the hospital , and to which nekhludoff gave credence , consisted only in that , when maslova , coming to the drug department for some pectoral herbs , prescribed by her superior , she found there an assistant , named ustinoff .
this ustinoff had been pursuing her with his attentions for a long time , and as he tried to embrace her she pushed him away with such force that he struck the shelving , and two bottles came crashing to the floor .
the chief physician was passing at the time , and , hearing the sound of the breaking glass , and seeing maslova running out , all flushed , he angrily shouted to her well , girl , if you begin to flirt here , i will send you back .
what is the matter ?
he turned to the assistant , sternly looking over his spectacles .
the assistant , smiling , began to apologize .
the doctor , without hearing him to the last , raised his head so that he began to look through the glasses , and walked into the ward .
on the same day he asked the inspector to send a more sedate nurse in place of maslova .
maslova expulsion from the hospital on the ground of flirting was particularly painful to her by reason of the fact that , after her meeting with nekhludoff , all association with men , which had so repugnant to her , became even more disgusting .
the fact that , judging her by her past and present condition , everybody , including the pimpled assistant , thought that they had the right to insult her , and were surprised when she refused their attentions , was very painful to her and called forth her tears and pity for herself .
now , coming out to see nekhludoff , she wished to explain the injustice of the charge which he had probably heard .
but as she attempted to do so , she felt that he would not believe her ; that her explanation would only tend to corroborate the suspicion , and her tears welled up in her throat , and she became silent .
maslova was still thinking , and continued to assure herself that , as she had told him on his second visit , she had not forgiven him ; that she hated him , but , in reality , she had long since begun to love him again , and loved him so that she involuntarily carried out his wishes .
she ceased to drink and smoke , she gave up flirting , and willingly went as servant to the hospital .
all this she did because she knew he wished it .
her repeated refusal to accept his sacrifice was partly due to the fact that she wished to repeat those proud words which she had once told him , and mainly because she knew that their marriage would make him unhappy .
she was firmly resolved not to accept his sacrifice , and yet it was painful for her to think that he despised her ; that he thought her to be the same as she had been , and did not see the change she was undergoing .
the fact that he was at that moment thinking that she did something wrong in the hospital pained her more than the news that she was finally sentenced to hard labor .
maslova might be sent away with the first party of exiles ; hence nekhludoff was preparing for departure .
but he had so many things to attend to that he felt that he could never get through with them , no matter how much time there might be left for preparations .
it was different in former times .
then it was necessary to devise something to do , and the interest in all his affairs centered in dmitri ivanovich nekhludoff .
but though all interest in life centered in dmitri ivanovich , he always suffered from ennui .
now , however , all his affairs related to people other than dmitri ivanovich , and were all interesting and attractive , as well as inexhaustible .
besides , formerly the occupation with the affairs of dmitri ivanovich always caused vexation and irritation ; while these affairs of others for the most part put him in a happy mood .
nekhludoff affairs were now divided into three parts .
he himself , in his habitual pedantism , thus divided them , and according placed them in three different portfolios .
the first was that of maslova .
this consisted in efforts to obtain a successful result in the pending petition , and preparations for departure to siberia .
the second part related to the settlement of his estates .
the panov land was granted to the peasants on condition of their paying a rent to be used for common necessities .
but , in order to complete that arrangement , it was necessary to sign an agreement and also make his will .
the arrangement made for the kusminskoie estate was to remain in force , only there remained to be determined what part of the rent he was to appropriate to himself , and what was to be left for the benefit of the peasants .
without knowing what his necessary disbursements would be on his trip to siberia , he could not make up his mind to deprive himself of his income , although he reduced it by .
the third part related to aid to prisoners , who were now applying to him more and more frequently .
at first , when written to for aid , he proceeded immediately to intercede for the applicants , endeavoring to relieve their condition , but in the end their number became so great that he found it impossible to help every one , and was involuntarily brought to a fourth matter , which had of late occupied him more than either of the others .
his fourth concern consisted in solving the question , why , how and whence came that remarkable institution called the criminal court , to which was due the existence of that prison , with the inmates of which he had become somewhat familiar , and all those places of confinement , beginning with the fortress dedicated to two saints , peter and paul , and ending with the island of saghalin , where hundreds and thousands of victims of that wonderful criminal law were languishing ?
from personal contact with prisoners , and from information received from the lawyer , the prison chaplain , the inspector , and from the prison register , nekhludoff came to the conclusion that the prisoners , criminals , could be divided into five classes .
the first class consisted of people entirely innocent , victims of judicial mistakes , such as that incendiary , menshov , or maslova , and others .
there were comparatively few people of this class , according to the observations of the chaplain about seven per but their condition attracted particular attention .
the second class consisted of people convicted for offenses committed under exceptional circumstances , such as anger , jealousy , drunkenness , offenses which , under similar circumstances , would almost invariably have been committed by all those who judged and punished them .
this class made up , according to nekhludoff observations , more than of all the prisoners .
to the third class belonged those who committed , according to their own ideas , the most indifferent or even good acts , but which were considered criminal by people entire strangers to them who were making the laws .
to this class belonged all those who carried on a secret trade in wine , or were bringing in contraband goods , or were picking herbs , or gathering wood , in private or government forests .
to this class also belonged the predatory mountaineers .
the fourth class consisted of people who , according to nekhludoff , were reckoned among the criminals only because they were morally above the average level of society .
among these the percentage of those who resisted interference with their affairs , or were sentenced for resisting the authorities , was very large .
the fifth class , finally , was composed of people who were more sinned against by society than they sinned themselves .
these were the helpless people , blunted by constant oppression and temptation , like that boy with the mats , and hundreds of others whom nekhludoff saw both in and out of prison , and the conditions of those whose lives systematically drove them to the necessity of committing those acts which are called crimes .
to these people belonged , according to nekhludoff observations , many thieves and murderers , with some of whom nekhludoff had come in contact .
among these nekhludoff found , on close acquaintance , those spoiled and depraved people whom the new school calls the criminal type , and the existence of which in society is given as the reason for the necessity of criminal law and punishment .
these depraved types , deviating from the normal , were , according to nekhludoff , none other than those very people who have sinned less against society than society has sinned against them , and against whom society has sinned , not directly , but through their ancestors .
nekhludoff attention was attracted by a habitual thief , okhotin , who came under this head .
he was the son of a fallen woman ; had grown up in , and till the age of thirty had never met a moral man .
in childhood he had fallen in with a gang of thieves , but he possessed a humorous vein which attracted people to him .
while asking nekhludoff for aid he jested at himself , the judges , the prison and all the laws , not only criminal , but even divine .
there was also a man , fedorff , who , in company with a gang of which he was the leader , had killed and robbed an old official .
this one was a peasant whose father house had been illegally taken from him , and who , while in the army , suffered for falling in love with an mistress .
he was attractive and passionate .
his sole desire in life was to enjoy himself , and he had never met any people who , out of any consideration , tempered their passions , nor had he ever heard that there was any other aim in life than personal enjoyment .
it was plain to nekhludoff that these two were richly endowed by nature , and were only neglected and mutilated as plants are sometimes neglected and mutilated .
he also came across a vagabond , and a woman , whose stupidity and apparent cruelty were repulsive , but he failed to find in them that criminal type spoken of by the italian school .
he only saw in them people who were disagreeable to him personally , like some he had met in , uniforms , and laces .
thus the investigation of the question why are people of such great variety of character confined in prisons , while others , no different than those , enjoy freedom and even judge those people ?
was the fourth concern of nekhludoff .
at first he hoped to find an answer to this question in books , and bought every book bearing on the subject .
he bought the works of lombroso , garofalo , ferri , mandsley and tard , and read them carefully .
but the more he read them , the greater was his disappointment .
the same thing happened with him that happens with people who appeal to science with direct , simple , vital questions , and not with a view of playing the part of an expounder , writer or teacher in it .
science solved a thousand and one various abstruse , complicated questions bearing on criminal law , but failed to give an answer to the question he had formed .
his question was very simple why and by what right do some people confine , torture , exile , flog and kill other people no different than they are themselves ?
and in answer they argued the questions whether or not man is a free agent ?
can a criminal be distinguished by the measurements of his cranium ?
to what extent is crime due to heredity ?
what is morality ?
what is insanity ?
what is degeneracy ?
what is temperament ?
how does climate , food , ignorance , emulation , hypnotism , passion affect crime ?
what is society ?
what are its duties ?
, etc .
these arguments reminded nekhludoff of an answer he had once received from a schoolboy .
he asked the boy whether he had learned the declension of nouns .
yes , answered the boy .
well , then decline . '
what paw ?
a dog paw ?
the boy answered , with a sly expression on his face .
similar answers in the form of questions nekhludoff found in scientific books to his one basic question .
he found there many wise , learned and interesting things , but there was no answer to his principal question by what right do some people punish others ?
not only was there no answer , but all reasoning tended to explain and justify punishment , the necessity of which was considered an axiom .
nekhludoff read much , but only by fits and starts , and the want of an answer he ascribed to such superficial reading .
he , therefore , refused to believe in the justice of the answer which constantly occurred to him .
the deportation of the party of convicts to which maslova belonged was set for the fifth of july , and nekhludoff was prepared to follow her on that day .
the day before his departure his sister , with her husband , arrived in town to see him .
nekhludoff sister , natalie ivanovna ragojhinsky , was ten years his senior .
he had grown up partly under her influence .
she loved him when he was a boy , and before her marriage they treated each other as equals ; she was and he was fifteen .
she had been in love then with his deceased friend , nikolenka irtenieff .
they both loved nikolenka , and loved in him and in themselves the good that was in them , and which unifies all people .
since that time they had both became corrupted he by the bad life he was leading ; she by her marriage to a man whom she loved sensually , but who not only did not love all that which she and dimitri at one time considered most holy and precious , but did not even understand it , and all those aspirations to moral perfection and to serving others , to which she had once devoted herself , he ascribed to selfishness and a desire to show off before people .
ragojhinsky was a man without reputation or fortune , but a clever fortune hunter , who , by skillful manoeuvering between liberalism and conservatism , availing himself of that dominating tendency which promised bitter results in life , but principally by something peculiar which attracted women to him , he succeeded in making a relatively brilliant judicial career .
he was already past his youth when he met nekhludoff abroad , made natalie , who was also not very young , to fall in love with him , and married her almost against the wish of her mother , who said that it would be a mésalliance .
nekhludoff , although he concealed it from himself and struggled against the feeling , hated his .
he disliked his vulgar feelings , his narrowness of mind , but , principally , because of his sister , who should so passionately , egotistically and sensually love such a poor nature , and to please whom she should stifle all her noble sentiments .
it was always painful to nekhludoff to think of natalie as the wife of that hairy , man , with shining bald head .
he could not even suppress his aversion to his children .
and whenever he heard that she was about to become a mother , he experienced a feeling of compassion for her being again infected with something bad by the man who was so unlike all of them .
the ragojhinskys arrived without their children , and engaged the best suite in the best hotel .
natalie ivanovna immediately went to the old home of her mother , and learning there that her brother had moved to furnished rooms , she went to his new home .
the dirty servant , meeting her in the dark , corridor , which was lit up by a lamp during the day , announced that the prince was away .
desiring to leave a note , natalie ivanovna was shown into his apartments .
she closely examined the two small rooms .
she noticed in every corner the familiar cleanliness and order , and she was struck by the modesty of the appointments .
on the writing table she saw a familiar , with the bronze figure of a dog , neatly arranged portfolios , papers , volumes of the criminal code and an english book of henry george , and a french one by tard , between the leaves of which was an ivory paper knife .
she left a note asking him to call on her the same evening , and , shaking her head in wonder at what she had seen , returned to her hotel .
there were two questions relating to her brother that interested natalie ivanovna his marriage to katiousha , of which she had heard in her city , where it was a matter of common gossip , and the distribution by him of his land to the peasants , upon which some people looked as something political and dangerous .
from one point of view , she rather liked the idea of his marrying katiousha .
she admired his resolution , seeing in it herself and him as they had been before her marriage .
at the same time , she was at the thought that her brother was to marry such an awful woman .
the latter feeling was the stronger , and she decided to dissuade him from marrying her , although she knew how hard that would be .
the other affair , that of his parting with his land , she did not take so close to heart , but her husband was indignant at such folly , and demanded that she influence her brother to abandon the attempt .
ignatius nikiforovitch said that it was the height of inconsistency , foolhardiness and pride ; that such an act could only be explained , if at all , by a desire to be odd , to have something to brag about , and to make people talk about one self .
what sense is there in giving the land to the peasants and making them pay rent to themselves ?
he said .
if his mind was set on doing it , he could sell them the land through the bank .
there would be some sense in that .
taking all in all , his act is very eccentric , said ignatius nikiforovitch , already considering the necessity of a guardianship , and he demanded that his wife should seriously speak to her brother of this , his strange intention .
in the evening nekhludoff went to his sister .
ignatius nikiforovitch was resting in another room , and natalie ivanovna alone met him .
she wore a black silk dress , with a knot of red ribbon , and her hair was done up according to the latest fashion .
she was evidently making herself look young for her husband .
seeing her brother , she quickly rose from the divan , and , rustling with her silk skirt , she went out to meet him .
they kissed and , smiling , looked at each other .
there was an exchange of those mysterious , significant glances in which everything was truth ; then followed an exchange of words in which that truth was lacking .
they had not met since the death of their mother .
you have grown stout and young , he said .
her lips contracted with pleasure .
and you have grown thin .
well , how is ignatius nikiforovitch ?
asked nekhludoff .
he is resting .
he has not slept all night .
a great deal should have been said here , but their words said nothing , and their glances said that that which interested them most was left unsaid .
i have been at your lodging .
yes , i know it .
i have moved from the house .
i am so lonely and weary .
i do not need any of those things , so you take them the furniture everything .
yes , agrippina petrovna told me .
i have been there .
i thank you very much .
but at that moment the servant brought in a silver tea service .
natalie ivanovna busied herself with making the tea .
nekhludoff was silent .
well , dimitri , i know everything , natalie said , resolutely , glancing at him .
i am very glad that you know .
do you think it possible to reform her after such a life ?
he was sitting erect on a small chair , attentively listening to her , prepared to answer satisfactorily her every question .
he was still in that frame of mind which , after his last meeting with maslova , filled his soul with tranquil happiness and love for all mankind .
it is not her that i intend to reform , but myself , he answered .
natalie ivanovna sighed .
there are other means besides marriage .
and i think that that is the best .
besides , that will bring me into that world in which i can be useful .
i do not think , said natalie ivanovna , that you could be happy .
it is not a question of my happiness .
of course ; but if she possesses a heart , she can not be happy she can not even desire it .
she does not .
i understand , but life demands something different .
life only demands that we do what is right , said nekhludoff , looking at her face , still beautiful , although covered with fine wrinkles around the eyes and mouth .
poor dear !
how she has changed !
thought nekhludoff , recalling natalie as she had been before her marriage , and a tender feeling , woven of countless recollections of their childhood , rose in his breast toward her .
at that moment ignatius nikiforovitch , as usual holding his head high and projecting his broad chest , entered the room , with shining , bald head and black beard .
how do you do ?
how do you do ?
he greeted nekhludoff , unnaturally accentuating his words .
they pressed each other hand , and ignatius nikiforovitch lowered himself into an .
am i disturbing you ?
no , i do not conceal anything i say or do from anybody .
as soon as nekhludoff saw that face , those hairy hands and heard that patronizing tone , his gentle disposition immediately disappeared .
yes , we have been speaking about his intention , said natalie ivanovna .
shall i pour out some tea for you ?
she added , taking the .
yes , if you please .
what intention do you refer to ?
my intention of going to siberia with that party of convicts , among whom there is a woman i have wronged , said nekhludoff .
i heard that you intended more than that .
yes , and marry her , if she only desires it .
i see !
and may i ask you to explain your motives , if it is not unpleasant to you ?
i do not understand them .
my motives are that that woman that the first step on her downward career nekhludoff became angry because he could not find the proper expression .
my motives are that i am guilty , while she is punished .
if she is punished , then she is also , probably , guilty .
she is perfectly innocent .
and , with unnecessary agitation , nekhludoff related the whole case .
yes , that was an omission by the presiding justice .
but in such cases there is the senate .
the senate sustained the verdict .
ah , then there were no grounds of appeal , said ignatius nikiforovitch , evidently sharing the opinion that truth is the product of court proceedings .
the senate can not go into the merits of a case .
but if there is really a judicial error , a petition should be made to the emperor .
that was done , but there is no chance of success .
inquiries will be made at the ministry , which will refer them to the senate , and the senate will repeat its decision , and , as usual , the innocent will be punished .
in the first place , the ministry will not refer to the senate , and ignatius nikiforovitch smiled condescendingly , but will call for all the documents in the case , and , if it finds an error , will so decide .
in the second place , an innocent person is never , or , at least , very seldom punished .
only the guilty is punished .
and i am convinced that the contrary is true , said nekhludoff , with an unkind feeling toward his .
i am convinced that the majority of the people convicted by courts are innocent .
how so ?
they are innocent in the ordinary sense of the word , as that woman was innocent of poisoning ; as that peasant is innocent of the murder which he has not committed ; as that mother and son are innocent of the arson which was committed by the owner himself , and for which they came near being convicted .
of course , there always have been and always will be judicial errors .
human institutions can not be perfect .
and , then , a large part of the innocent , because they have been brought up amid certain conditions , do not consider the acts committed by them criminal .
pardon me ; that is unfair .
every thief knows that stealing is wrong ; that theft is immoral , ignatius nikiforovitch said , with the calm , , and , at the same time , somewhat contemptuous , smile which particularly provoked nekhludoff .
no , he does not know .
he is told not to steal , but he sees and knows that the employers steal his labor , keep back his pay , and that the officials are constantly robbing him .
that is anarchism , ignatius calmly defined the meaning of his words .
i do not know what it is , but i am speaking of facts , nekhludoff continued .
he knows that the officials are robbing him .
he knows that we , the landlords , own the land which ought to be common property , and when he gathers some twigs for his oven we send him to jail and try to convince him that he is a thief .
i do not understand , and if i do , i can not agree with you .
the land can not be nobody property .
if you divide it , ignatius nikiforovitch began , being fully convinced that nekhludoff was a socialist , and that the theory of socialism demands that all the land should be divided equally ; that such division is foolish , and that he can easily refute it .
if you should divide the land , giving each inhabitant an equal share , it will again find its way into the hands of the more industrious and able among them nobody even thinks of dividing the land into equal shares .
there ought to be no property in land , and it ought not to be the subject of purchase and sale or renting .
the right of property is a natural right .
without property right there would be no interest in cultivating the land .
destroy property right and we will return to the condition of the savage , authoritatively said ignatius nikiforovitch .
on the contrary , only then will land not lie idle , as it is now .
but , dimitri ivanovich , it is perfect madness !
is it possible in our time to destroy property in land ?
i know it is your old hobby .
but permit me to tell you plainly ignatius nikiforovitch turned pale and his voice trembled .
the question was evidently of particular concern to him .
i would advise you to consider that question well before attempting its practical solution .
you are speaking of my personal affairs ?
yes .
i assume that we are all placed in a certain position , and must assume the duties that result from that position , must support those conditions of existence into which we were born , which we have inherited from our forefathers , and which we must hand over to our posterity .
i consider it my duty excuse me , continued ignatius nikiforovitch , who would not be interrupted .
i am not speaking of myself and my children .
the fortune of my children is secure , and i earn enough to live in easy circumstances , and , therefore , my protest against your , permit me to say , actions is not based on personal interest , but on principle .
and i would advise you to give it a little more thought , to read you had better let me decide my own affairs .
i think i know what to read and what not to read , said nekhludoff , turning pale , and , feeling that he could not control himself , became silent and began to drink his tea .
well , how are the children ?
nekhludoff asked his sister , having calmed down .
thus the unpleasant conversation was changed .
natalie became calm and talked about her children .
she would not speak , however , about those things which only her brother understood in the presence of her husband , and in order to continue the conversation she began to talk of the latest news , the killing of kanesky in the duel .
ignatius nikiforovitch expressed his disapproval of the condition of things which excluded the killing in a duel from the category of crimes .
his remark called forth nekhludoff reply , and a hot discussion followed on the same subject , neither expressing fully his opinion , and in the end they were again at loggerheads .
ignatius nikiforovitch felt that nekhludoff condemned him , hating all his activity , and he wished to prove the injustice of his reasoning .
nekhludoff , on the other hand , to say nothing of the vexation caused him by his interference in his affairs ( in the depth of his soul he felt that his , his sister and their children , as heirs , had the right to do so ) , was indignant at the calm and confident manner of that man who continued to consider legal and just that which to nekhludoff was undoubtedly foolish .
this irritated him .
what should the court do ?
asked nekhludoff .
sentence one of the duelists , as it would a common murderer , to hard labor .
nekhludoff hands again turned cold , and he continued with warmth well , what would be then ?
justice would be done .
as if the aim of courts was to do justice !
said nekhludoff .
what else ?
their aim is to support class interests .
courts , according to my idea , are only instruments for the perpetuation of conditions profitable to our class .
that is an entirely new view , said ignatius nikiforovitch , smiling calmly .
usually somewhat different aims are ascribed to courts .
in theory , but not in practice , as i have learned .
the only aim of the courts is to preserve the existing state of things , and for this reason they persecute and kill all those who are above the common level and who wish to raise it as well as those who are below it .
i can not agree with the view that criminals are executed because they are above the level of the average .
for the most part they are the excrescence of society , just as perverted , though in a different manner , as are those criminal types whom you consider below the level of the average .
and i know people who are far above their judges .
but ignatius nikiforovitch , not accustomed to being interrupted when speaking , did not listen to nekhludoff , which was particularly irritating to the latter , and continued to talk while nekhludoff was talking .
i can not agree with you that the aim of courts is to support the existing order of things .
the courts have their aims either the correction prisons are great places for correction , nekhludoff put in .
or the removal , persistently continued ignatius nikiforovitch , of those depraved and savage people who threaten the existence of society .
that is just where the trouble is .
courts can do neither the one nor the other .
society has no means of doing it .
how is that ?
i do understand asked ignatius nikiforovitch , with a forced smile .
i mean to say that there are only two sensible modes of punishment those that have been used in olden times corporal punishment and capital punishment .
but with the advance of civilization they have gone out of existence .
that is both new and surprising to hear from you .
yes , there is sense in inflicting pain on a man that he might not repeat that for which the pain was inflicted ; and it is perfectly sensible to cut the head off a harmful and dangerous member of society .
but what sense is there in imprisoning a man , who is depraved by idleness and bad example , and keeping him in secure and compulsory idleness in the society of the most depraved people ?
or to transport him , for some reason , at an expense to the government of five hundred roubles , from the district of tula to the district of irkutsk , or from kursk but people seem to fear these journeys at government expense .
and were it not for these journeys , we would not be sitting here as we are sitting now .
prisons can not secure our safety , because people are not imprisoned for life , but are released .
on the contrary , these institutions are the greatest breeders of vice and corruption .
, they increase the danger .
you mean to say that the penitentiary system ought to be perfected ?
it can not be perfected .
perfected prisons would cost more than is spent on popular education and would be a new burden on the populace .
but the deficiencies of the penitentiary system do not invalidate the judicial system , ignatius nikiforovitch again continued , without listening to his .
these deficiencies can not be corrected , said nekhludoff , raising his voice .
what then ?
would you kill ?
or , as a certain statesman suggested , pluck out their eyes ?
said ignatius nikiforovitch , smiling triumphantly .
yes ; that would be cruel , but expedient .
what we are doing now is both cruel and inexpedient .
and i am taking part in it , said ignatius nikiforovitch , paling .
that is your business .
but i do not understand it .
i think there are many things you do not understand , said ignatius nikiforovitch , with a quiver in his voice .
i saw a public prosecutor in court trying his utmost to convict an unfortunate boy , who could only arouse compassion in any unperverted man if i thought so , i should give up my position , said ignatius nikiforovitch , rising .
nekhludoff noticed a peculiar glitter under his .
can it be tears ?
thought nekhludoff .
they really were tears .
ignatius nikiforovitch was offended .
going toward the window , he drew a handkerchief from his pocket , coughed , and began to wipe his , and , removing them , he also wiped his eyes .
returning to the couch , ignatius nikiforovitch lit a cigar and spoke no more .
nekhludoff was pained and ashamed at the grief that he had caused his and sister , especially as he was leaving the next day and would not see them again .
in great agitation he took leave of them and departed .
it is quite possible that what i said was true .
at any rate , he did not refute me .
but it was wrong to speak that way .
little have i changed if i could insult him and grieve poor natalie , he thought .
the party of convicts , which included maslova , was to leave on the three train , and in order to see them coming out of the prison and follow them to the railroad station nekhludoff decided to get to the prison before twelve .
while packing his clothes and papers , nekhludoff came across his diary and began to read the entry he had made before leaving for petersburg .
katiusha does not desire my sacrifice , but is willing to sacrifice herself , it ran .
she has conquered , and i have conquered .
i am rejoicing at that inner change which she seems to me to be undergoing .
i fear to believe it , but it appears to me that she is awakening .
immediately after this was the following entry i have lived through a very painful and very joyous experience .
i was told that she had misbehaved in the hospital .
it was very painful to hear it .
did not think it would so affect me .
have spoken to her with contempt and hatred , but suddenly remembered how often i myself have been guilty am even now , although only in thought , of that for which i hated her , and suddenly i was seized with disgust for myself and pity for her , and i became very joyful .
if we would only see in time the beam in our own eye , how much kinder we would be .
then he made the following entry for the day have seen katiusha , and , because of my , was unkind and angry , and departed with a feeling of oppression .
but what can i do ?
a new life begins .
farewell to the old life !
my mind is filled with numberless impressions , but i can not yet reduce them to order .
on awakening the following morning , nekhludoff first feeling was one of sorrow for the unpleasant incident with his .
i must go to see them , he thought , and smooth it over .
but , looking at the clock , he saw that there was no time left , and that he must hasten to the prison to see the departure of the convicts .
hastily packing up his things and sending them to the depot , nekhludoff hired a trap and drove to the prison .
the hot july days had set in .
the stones of the street , the houses , and the tins of the roofs , failing to cool off during the suffocating night , exhaled their warmth into the hot , still air .
there was no breeze , and such as rose every now and then was laden with dust and the stench of oil paint .
the few people that were on the streets sought shelter in the shade of the houses .
only in bast shoes were sitting in the middle of the street , setting boulders into the hot sand ; gloomy policemen in unstarched blouses and carrying revolvers attached to yellow cords , were lazily shuffling about , and with drawn blinds on the sides exposed to the sun , and drawn by horses , were running up and down the street .
when nekhludoff arrived at the prison , the formal delivery and acceptance of the departing convicts , which began at four in the morning , were still going on .
the party consisted of six hundred and men and women ; all had to be counted , the weak and sick had to be separated , and they were to be delivered to the convoy .
the new inspector , two assistants , a physician , his assistant , the officer of the convoy and a clerk were sitting in the shade around a table with papers and documents , calling and examining each convict and making entries in their books .
of the table was already exposed to the sun .
it was getting warm and close from want of air , and from the breathing of the convicts standing near by .
will there ever be an end ?
said a tall , stout , captain of the convoy , incessantly smoking a cigarette and blowing the smoke through the moustache which covered his mouth .
i am exhausted .
where have you taken so many ?
how many more are there ?
the clerk consulted the books .
men and the women .
why are you standing there ?
come forward !
shouted the captain to the crowding convicts .
the convicts had already been standing three hours in a broiling sun , waiting their turn .
all this was taking place in the of the prison , while without the prison stood the usual armed soldier , about two dozen trucks for the baggage , and the infirm convicts , and on the corner a crowd of relatives and friends of the convicts , waiting for a chance to see the exiles as they emerged from the prison , and , if possible , to have a last few words with them , or deliver some things they had brought for them .
nekhludoff joined this crowd .
he stood there about an hour .
at the end of the hour , from behind the gates came the clatter of chains , the tramping of feet , voices of command , coughing and the low conversation of a large crowd .
this lasted about five minutes , during which time prison officers flitted in and out through the wicket .
finally there was heard a sharp command .
the gates were noisily flung open , the clatter of the chains became more distinct , and a detachment of guardsmen in white blouses and shouldering guns marched forth and arranged themselves , evidently as a customary manoeuvre , in a large before the gates .
again a command was heard , and the convicts , in pairs , began to pour out .
with caps on their shaved heads , and sacks on their shoulders , they dragged their fettered legs , holding up the sacks with one hand and waving the other .
first came the men convicts , all in gray trousers and long coats with diamond aces on their backs .
all of them young , old , slim , stout , pale , and , , moustached , bearded and beardless , russians , tartars , jews came , clanging their chains and briskly waving their hands as though going on a long journey ; but after making about ten steps they stopped and humbly arranged themselves in rows of four .
immediately behind these came another contingent , also with shaved heads and similarly dressed , without , but handcuffed to each other .
these were exiles .
they walked as briskly as the others , stopped , and formed in rows of four .
then came the women in the same order , in gray coats and , those sentenced to hard labor coming first ; then the exiles , and finally those voluntarily following their husbands , in their native costumes .
some of the women carried infants under the skirts of their coats .
children boys and girls followed them on foot , hanging on to the skirts of their mothers .
the men stood silently , coughing now and then , or exchanging remarks , while the women carried on incessant conversation .
nekhludoff thought that he saw maslova as she was coming out , but she was soon lost in the large crowd , and he only saw a lot of gray creatures almost deprived of all womanly features , with their children and sacks , grouping themselves behind the men .
although the convicts had been counted within the walls of the prison , the guard began to count them over again .
this counting took a long time , because the convicts , moving from one place to another , confused the count of the officers .
the officers cursed and pushed the humbly but angrily compliant convicts and counted them again .
when the counting was finally over , the officer of the guard gave some command , and suddenly all became confusion in the crowd .
infirm men , women and children hastened to the trucks , on which they first placed their sacks , then climbed in themselves , the infants crying in their mothers ' arms , the children quarreling about the places , the men looking gloomy and despondent .
some of the convicts , removing their caps , approached the officer and made some request .
as nekhludoff afterward learned , they were asking to be taken on the wagons .
the guard officer , without looking at the applicants , silently inhaled the smoke of his cigarette , then suddenly swung his short hand at one of the convicts that approached him , who dodged and sprang back .
i will elevate you to the nobility with a rope !
you can walk !
shouted the officer .
only a tall , staggering old man in irons was permitted to ride on a wagon .
the old man removed his cap , and making the sign of the cross , dragged himself to the wagon ; but his fettered legs prevented his climbing up until an old woman , sitting on the wagon , took his hand and helped him in .
when all the wagons were loaded with sacks and those that were permitted to ride , the guard officer uncovered his bald head , wiped with a handkerchief his pate , forehead and red , stout neck , made the sign of the cross , and gave command to proceed .
there was a clatter of weapons ; the convicts , removing their caps , began to make the sign of the cross , some with their left hands ; the escorting crowd shouted something , the convicts shouted in answer ; a great wailing arose among the women , and the party , surrounded by soldiers in white blouses moved forward , raising a cloud of dust with their fettered feet .
they marched in the order in which they formed at the prison gates , in rows of four , preceded by a detachment of soldiers .
the rear was brought up by the wagons loaded with the sacks and the infirm .
on top of one of the wagons , above all the others , sat a woman , wrapped up in her coat and sobbing incessantly .
when nekhludoff reached the railroad station the prisoners were already seated in the cars , behind grated windows .
there were a few people on the platform , come to see their departing relatives , but they were not allowed to come near the cars .
the guards were greatly troubled this day .
on the way from the prison to the station five men had died from sunstroke .
three of them had been taken to the nearest police station from the street , while two were stricken at the railroad station .
f they were troubled not because five men had died while under their guard .
that did not bother them ; but they were chiefly concerned with doing all that the law required them to do under the circumstances to make proper transfer of the dead , their papers and belongings , and to exclude them from the list of those that were to be transferred to nijhni , which was very troublesome , especially on such a warm day .
this it was that occupied the convoy , and this was the reason why nekhludoff and others were not permitted to approach the cars while the formalities were unfinished .
however , upon bribing one of the sergeants , nekhludoff was permitted to come near the cars , the sergeant asking him to do his errand so that the captain would not see him .
there were eighteen cars , and all , except the one reserved for the authorities , were literally packed with prisoners .
passing by the windows , nekhludoff listened to the sounds within .
everywhere he heard the rattling of chains , bustle , and the hum of conversation , interspersed with stupid profanity ; but nowhere did he hear , as he expected , any reference to the dead comrades .
their conversation related more to sacks , , and the choice of seats .
looking into the window of one of the cars , nekhludoff saw some guardsmen removing the handcuffs from the wrists of the prisoners .
the prisoners stretched out their hands , while one of the guards with a key opened the locks of the handcuffs , which were collected by another .
when nekhludoff reached the second car occupied by the women he heard a woman moan , oh , heavens !
oh , heavens !
nekhludoff passed by and approached one of the windows of the third car , pointed out to him by one of the guards .
overheated air , impregnated with a thick odor of perspiration , assailed his nostrils , and shrill women voices were distinctly heard .
all the benches were occupied by flushed , perspiring women in waists and coats , loudly conversing .
his approach attracted their attention .
those sitting nearest to the grated window became silent .
maslova , in a waist and without headgear , was sitting near the opposite window .
the smiling theodosia , who was sitting near maslova , seeing nekhludoff , pushed her with her elbow and pointed to nekhludoff .
maslova hurriedly rose , threw a over her black hair , and , with an animated , red , perspiring and smiling face , came near the window and placed her hands on the grating .
but how warm it is !
she said , smiling joyously .
did you get the things ?
i did , thank you .
do you need anything ?
asked nekhludoff , feeling the heat issuing from the window as from a steam bath .
i do not need anything .
thank you .
if we could only get some water , said theodosia .
yes , some water , repeated maslova .
i will ask one of the guards , said nekhludoff .
we will not meet now until we reach nijhni .
why , are you going there ?
she said , as if she did not know it , but joyously glancing at nekhludoff .
i am going on the next train .
maslova was silent for a few moments ; then sighed deeply .
is it true , master , that twelve people have died from the heat ?
said a churlish old woman in a hoarse voice .
it was korableva .
i do know that twelve have died .
i have seen two , said nekhludoff .
they say twelve .
they ought to be punished for it , the devils !
how is it with the women ?
asked nekhludoff .
women are stronger , said another prisoner , smiling .
only there is one who has taken it into her head to give birth to a child .
listen to her wailing , she said , pointing to the adjacent car , from which the moaning proceeded .
you asked if anything was needed , said maslova , endeavoring to restrain a happy smile .
could not that woman be taken off the train ?
she suffers so .
wo you tell the authorities ?
yes , i will .
another thing could you not get her to see her husband , tarass ?
she added , pointing to the smiling theodosia .
he is going with you , he ?
at this point the voice of a sergeant was heard reminding nekhludoff that talking with the prisoners was prohibited .
it was not the sergeant who passed nekhludoff .
nekhludoff walked off to find the captain , intending to see him about the sick woman and tarass , but for a long time could not find him , the guards being too busy to answer his inquiries .
some were leading away one of the convicts ; others were hurrying away to buy their provisions ; still others were attending a lady who was traveling with the captain of the convoy .
nekhludoff found the captain after the second bell .
the captain , wiping his thick moustache with his short hand and raising his shoulders , was reprimanding one of the sergeants .
what is it you want ?
he asked nekhludoff .
there is a woman giving birth to a child , so i thought it would be well well , let her .
when the child is born we will see to it , said the captain , passing to his car .
the conductor came with a whistle in his hand .
the third bell sounded , and a loud wailing rose among the female prisoners and their friends and relatives on the platform .
nekhludoff was standing beside tarass , and watched the cars passing before him , with the grated windows and the shaved heads seen through them .
as the one in which maslova was passed , he saw her standing with others at the window , looking at him and smiling piteously .
footnote f early in the eighties five prisoners died from sunstroke while being transferred from the boutyr prison to the nijhni railroad l .
the passenger train which was to carry away nekhludoff was to start in two hours .
nekhludoff at first thought of utilizing these two hours in visiting his sister , but after the impressions of the morning he felt so excited and exhausted that he seated himself on a sofa in the saloon for passengers .
but he unexpectedly felt so drowsy that he turned on his side , placed his palm under his cheek , and immediately fell asleep .
he was awakened by a servant in holding a napkin in his hand .
mister , mister , are you not prince nekhludoff ?
a lady is looking for you .
nekhludoff quickly raised himself , rubbing his eyes , and the incidents of the morning passed before his mind eye the procession of the convicts , the men who had died from the heat , the grated windows of the cars , and the women huddled behind them , one of whom was laboring in without aid , and another piteously smiling to him from behind the iron grating .
but in reality he saw a table covered with bottles , vases , chandeliers , and fruit stands ; nimble servants bustling around the table , and in the depth of the saloon , before the , loaded with viands and fruits , the backs of passengers leisurely eating their luncheon .
while nekhludoff was raising himself and shaking off the slumber , he noticed that everybody in the saloon was curiously watching the entrance .
he turned his eyes in the same direction , and saw a procession of people who bore an in which was seated a lady , her head covered with tulle .
the first bearer was a lackey who seemed familiar to nekhludoff .
the one behind was also a familiar porter , with white crown lace around his cap .
behind the came an elegantly dressed with curly hair , carrying a round leather box and a sunshade .
further behind came the prince korchagin , his shoulders thrown back ; then missy , misha , their cousin , and a diplomat osten , unfamiliar to nekhludoff , with his long neck and prominent adam apple and an ever cheerful appearance .
he walked impressively , but evidently jestingly talking to the smiling missy .
behind them came the doctor , angrily smoking a cigarette .
the korchagins were moving from their estate to the prince sister , whose estate was situated on the nijhni road .
the procession passed into the ladies ' room .
the old prince , however , seating himself at the table , immediately called over a waiter and began to order something .
missy with osten also stopped in the , and were about to sit down when they saw an acquaintance in the doorway and went to meet her .
it was natalia ivanovna .
she was escorted by agrippina petrovna , and as she entered the she looked around .
at almost the same moment she noticed missy and her brother .
she first approached missy , only nodding her head to nekhludoff .
but after kissing missy she immediately turned to him .
at last i have found you , she said .
after greeting his sister , nekhludoff entered into conversation with missy , who told him that their house had burned down , necessitating their removal to her aunt .
osten began to relate a droll anecdote anent the fire .
nekhludoff , without listening to osten , turned to his sister how glad i am that you came !
in the course of their conversation he told her how sorry he felt for having fallen out with her husband ; that he had intended to return and confess that he was at fault , but that he knew not how her husband would take it .
i spoke improperly to him , and it tortured me , he said .
i knew it .
i was sure you did intend it , said his sister .
you know the tears welled up in her eyes , and she touched her brother hand .
it was spoken tenderly ; he understood her , and was affected .
the meaning of her words was that , besides her love for her husband , her love for her brother was dear and important to her , and that any disagreement with him caused her suffering .
thank you , thank you .
oh , what i have seen !
he said , suddenly recalling the two dead convicts .
two convicts have been killed .
how killed ?
so , simply killed .
they have been brought here in this heat , and two of them died from sunstroke .
impossible !
how ?
?
just now ?
yes , just now .
i have seen their corpses .
why were they killed ?
who killed them ?
asked natalia ivanovna .
those who forcibly brought them here , said nekhludoff excitedly , feeling that she took the same view of this as her husband .
oh , my god !
said agrippina petrovna , coming nearer to them .
yes , we have no conception of the life these unfortunates are leading , and it is necessary to know it , nekhludoff added , looking at the old prince , who , sitting at the table with a napkin tucked under his chin and a large glass before him , at that moment glanced at nekhludoff .
nekhludoff , he shouted .
wo you take sauce to cool off ?
it is excellent stuff .
nekhludoff refused and turned away .
but what will you do ?
continued natalia ivanovna .
i will do what i can .
i do not know what , but i feel that i must do something .
and i will do what i can .
yes , yes , i understand that .
and what about him ?
she said , smiling and nodding in the direction of korchagin .
is it really all over ?
yes , it is and i think without regret on either side .
i am very sorry .
i like her .
but i suppose it must be so .
but why should you bind yourself ?
why are you following her ?
because it is proper that i should , nekhludoff said dryly , as though desiring to change the subject .
but he immediately felt ashamed of his coldness to his sister .
why should i not tell her what i think ?
he thought ; and let agrippina petrovna also know it , he said to himself , looking at the old servant .
the presence of agrippina petrovna only encouraged him to repeat his decision to his sister .
you are speaking of my intention to marry katiusha .
you see , i have decided to do it , but she firmly and decidedly refused me , he said , and his voice trembled , as it always did when he spoke of it .
she does not desire my sacrifice , and in her position she sacrifices very much , and i could not accept her sacrifice , even if it were only momentary .
that is why i am following her , and i will be near her , and will endeavor to relieve her condition as far as i am able .
natalia ivanovna was silent .
agrippina petrovna looked inquiringly at natalia ivanovna , shaking her head .
at that moment the procession started again from the ladies ' room .
the same handsome phillip and the porter were bearing the princess .
she stopped the bearers , beckoned nekhludoff to her side , and in a piteously languid manner extended her white , hand , with horror anticipating the hard pressure of his .
! she said of the heat .
it is unbearable .
climat me and having said a few words of the horrors of the russian climate , and invited nekhludoff to visit them , she gave a sign to the bearers .
do fail to come , now , she added , turning her long face to nekhludoff .
nekhludoff went out on the platform .
the procession turned to the right , toward the coaches .
nekhludoff , with a porter who carried his baggage , and tarass , with his bags , turned to the left .
that is my comrade , nekhludoff said to his sister , pointing to tarass , whose story he had told her before .
what , are you taking the third class ?
asked natalia ivanovna , when nekhludoff stopped before a car and the porter , with tarass , entered it .
yes , i will have it more convenient then .
tarass is with me .
another thing , he added .
i have not yet given the kusminskoie land to the peasants .
so that , in case of my death , your children will inherit it .
dmitri , do talk that way , said natalia ivanovna .
and if i do give it away , then all i have to tell you is that the remainder will be theirs , for i shall hardly marry .
and if i do , there will be no children so that dmitri , please stop it , said natalia ivanovna ; but nekhludoff saw that she was glad to hear what he was saying .
the time for parting had come .
the conductors were closing the doors , inviting the passengers to take seats , others to leave the cars .
nekhludoff entered the heated and car and immediately appeared on its platform .
natalia ivanovna was standing opposite , and evidently wished to say something , but could not find words .
she could not say , because they had long been ridiculing the customary phrase of parting friends .
the conversation about financial affairs and the inheritance at once destroyed the tender relations they had resumed .
they now felt themselves estranged from each other .
so that natalia ivanovna was glad when the train began to move and she could say , with a smile well , dmitri , !
as soon as the train left she began to think how to tell her husband of her conversation with her brother , and her face became grave and worried .
and though nekhludoff entertained the best sentiments toward his sister , and he concealed nothing from her , he now felt estranged from her , and was glad to be rid of her .
he felt that the natasha of old was no more ; that there was only a slave of an unpleasant , dark , hairy man with whom he had nothing in common .
he plainly saw this , because her face became illumined with peculiar animation only when he spoke of that which interested her husband of the distribution of the land among the peasants , and of the inheritance .
this made him sad .
the heat in the large car of the third class , due to its exposure to the scorching sun rays and the large crowd within , was so suffocating that nekhludoff remained on the platform .
but there was no relief even there , and he drew in long breaths when the train rolled out beyond the houses and the movement of the train created a draught .
yes , killed , he repeated to himself .
and to his imagination appeared with unusual vividness the beautiful face of the second dead convict , with a smile on his lips , the forbidding expression of his forehead , and the small , strong ear under the shaved , bluish scalp .
and the worst part of it is that he was killed , and no one knows who killed him .
yet he was killed .
he was forwarded , like the others , at the order of maslenikoff .
maslenikoff probably signed the usual order with his foolish flourish , on a printed , and , of course , does not consider himself guilty .
the prison physician , who inspected the convicts , has still less reason for considering himself guilty .
he carefully fulfilled his duties , separated the weak ones , and could not possibly foresee either the terrible heat , or that they would be taken away so late and in such a crowd .
the inspector ?
but the inspector only carried out the order that on such a day so many men and women prisoners should be sent away .
no more guilty was the officer of the convoy , whose duty consisted in receiving so many people at such a place and delivering them at another place .
he led the party in the usual way , according to instructions , and could not possibly foresee that such strong men , like the two whom nekhludoff had seen , would succumb and die .
no one was guilty , and yet the men were killed by these very people who were innocent of their death .
all this happened , thought nekhludoff , because all those people the governor , inspector and the other officers saw before them , not human beings and their duties toward them , but the service and its requirements .
therein lies the difficulty .
in his meditation nekhludoff did not notice how the weather had changed .
the sun had hidden behind a low strip of cloud , and from the southern sky a mass , from which a slanting rain was already pouring in the distance over the fields and forests , was coming on .
now and then a flash of lightning rent the clouds , and the rattle of the train mingled with the rattle of thunder .
the clouds came nearer and nearer , the slanting drops of rain , driven by the wind , pattered on the platform of the car and stained nekhludoff overcoat .
he moved to the other side , and drawing in the fresh , humid air and the odor of the wheat coming from the parched ground , he looked on the passing gardens , forests ; the rye fields just turning yellow , the emerald streaks of oats , and the furrows of the , flowering potato .
everything looked as if covered with varnish the green and yellow colors became brighter ; the black became blacker .
more , more , said nekhludoff , rejoicing at the reviving fields and gardens under the abundant rain .
the heavy rain did not last long .
the clouds partly dissipated , and the last fine shower fell straight on the wet ground .
the sun came forth again , the earth brightened , and a low but brilliant violet tinged rainbow , broken at one end , appeared in the eastern horizon .
what was i thinking of ?
nekhludoff asked himself , when all these changes of nature came to an end and the train descended into a vale .
yes , i was thinking that all those people the inspector , the guard and all those servants , for the most part gentle , kind people have become wicked .
he recalled the indifference of maslenikoff when he told the latter of what was going on in the prison , of the severity of the inspector , the cruelty of the sergeant who refused the use of the wagons to the weak convicts and paid no attention to the suffering of the woman in .
all those people were evidently proof against the feeling of sympathy , as is this paved ground against rain , he thought , looking at the incline paved with stone , from which the water streamed off .
may be it is necessary to lay the stones on the incline , but it is sad to see the soil deprived of vegetation when it could be made to grow grain , grass , shrubs and trees like those seen on those heights .
it is the same with people , thought nekhludoff .
the whole trouble lies in that people think that there are conditions excluding the necessity of love in their intercourse with man , but such conditions do not exist .
things may be treated without love ; one may chop wood , make bricks , forge iron without love , but one can no more deal with people without love than one can handle bees without care .
the nature of bees is such that if you handle them carelessly you will harm them as well as yourself .
it is the same with people .
and it can not be different , because mutual love is the basic law of human life .
true , man can not compel himself to love , as he can compel himself to work , but it does not follow from this that in his dealings with men he can leave love out of consideration , especially if he wants something from them .
if you feel no love for people , then keep away from them , nekhludoff said to himself .
occupy yourself with things , yourself anything ; only keep away from people .
as it is harmful to eat except when one is hungry , so is it harmful to have intercourse with people when one does not love them .
if one permits himself to deal with people without having any love for them , as i did yesterday with my , there is no limit to the cruelty and brutality one is liable to display toward others , as i have seen , and there is no limit to one own suffering , as i have learned from all the experiences of my own life .
yes , yes , that is so , thought nekhludoff , experiencing the double pleasure of a cool breeze after the intolerable heat , and the consciousness of having reached the highest degree of lucidity in the question which had so long occupied him .
.
the party of convicts to which maslova belonged had gone about hundred miles .
it was not until perm was reached that nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining maslova transfer to the contingent of politicals , as he was advised to do by bogodukhovskaia , who was among them .
the journey to perm was very burdensome to maslova , both physically and morally physically because of the crowded condition of their quarters , the uncleanliness and disgusting insects , which gave her no rest ; morally because of the equally loathsome men who , though they changed at every stopping place , were like the insects , always insolent , intrusive and gave her little rest .
the cynicism prevailing among the convicts and their overseers was such that every woman , especially the young women , had to be on the alert .
maslova was particularly subject to these attacks because of her attractive looks and her past .
this condition of constant dread and struggle was very burdensome to her .
the firm repulse with which she met the impertinent advances of the men was taken by them as an insult and exasperated them .
her condition in this respect was somewhat relieved by the presence of theodosia and tarass , who , learning that his wife was subjected to these insults , had himself included among the prisoners , and riding as such from nijhni , was able to protect her to some extent .
maslova transfer to the division of the politicals bettered her situation in every respect .
besides the improvement in the quarters , food and treatment , her condition was also made easier by the fact that the persecution of the men ceased and she was no longer reminded of her past , which she was so anxious to forget now .
the principal advantage of the transfer , however , lay in the acquaintance she made of some people who exerted a decisive influence over her .
at stopping places she was permitted to mingle with the politicals , but , being a strong woman , she was compelled to walk with the other prisoners .
she thus walked from tomsk .
there were two politicals who traveled on foot with her maria pablovna stchetinina , the same pretty girl with the sheepish eyes who had attracted nekhludoff attention when visiting bogodukhovskaia , and one simonson , banished to yakoutsk that same shaggy man with eyes whom nekhludoff had noticed on the same occasion .
maria pablovna walked , because she yielded her place on the wagon to a pregnant woman ; simonson , because he would not profit by class advantages .
these three started on foot with the other convicts in the early morning , the politicals following them later in wagons .
it was at the last stopping place , near a large city , where the party was handed over to another convoy officer .
it was a chill september morning .
snow and rain fell alternately between cold blasts of wind .
all the prisoners men and women were already in the , some crowding around the chief officer of the convoy , who was paying out money to the overseers for the day rations ; others were buying food of the hucksters who had been admitted into the .
there were a din of voices counting money and the shrill conversation of the hucksters .
katiousha and maria pablovna , both in boots and short fur coats and girdled with , came into the from the house and walked toward the hucksters , who were sitting under the northern wall and calling out their wares fresh , fish , boiled shred paste , buckwheat mush , meat , eggs , milk ; one woman even offered roasted pig .
simonson , in rubber jacket and similar galoshes , bound with over woolen socks ( he was a vegetarian and did not use the skin of animals ) , was also awaiting the departure of the party .
he stood near the entrance of the house , writing down in a a thought that occurred to him .
if , he wrote , a bacterium were to observe and analyze the nail of a man , it would declare him an inorganic being .
similarly , from an observation of the earth surface , we declare it to be inorganic .
that is wrong .
having bought eggs , buns , fish and fresh wheat bread , maslova packed them away in a bag while maria pablovna settled for the food , when among the prisoners there arose a commotion .
every one became silent , and the prisoners began to form into ranks .
an officer came forth and gave final orders .
everything proceeded as usual the prisoners were counted over , the chains were examined and men were handcuffed in pairs .
after six years of luxurious and pampered life in the city and two months in prison among the politicals , her present life , notwithstanding the hard conditions , seemed to katiousha very satisfactory .
the journeys of fifteen or twenty miles on foot between stopping places , the food and day rest after two days ' tramp , strengthened her physically , while her association with her new comrades opened up to her new phases of life of which she had formerly no conception .
she was charmed with all her new comrades .
but above all , with maria pablovna nay , she even came to love her with a respectful and exulting love .
she was struck by the fact that a beautiful girl of a rich and noble family , and speaking three languages , should conduct herself like a common workingwoman , distribute everything sent her by her rich brother , dress herself not only simply , but poorly , and pay no attention to her appearance .
this entire absence of coquetry surprised and completely captivated maslova .
she saw that maria pablovna knew , and that it even pleased her to know , that she was pretty , but that so far from rejoicing at the impression she was making on the men , she only feared it , and rather looked at love with disgust and dread .
if her male comrades , who knew her , felt any attraction toward her they never showed it .
but strangers often attempted familiarities with her , and in such cases her great physical strength stood her in good stead .
once , she laughingly related , i was approached by a stranger on the street , whom i could not get rid of .
i then gave him such a shaking up that he ran away in fright .
she also said that from childhood she had felt an aversion for the life of the gentry , but loved the common folks , and was often chidden for staying in the servants ' quarters , the kitchen and the stable , instead of the parlor .
but among the cooks and drivers i was always cheerful , while our ladies and gentlemen used to worry me .
afterward , when i began to understand , i saw that we were leading a wicked life .
i had no mother , and i did not like my father .
at nineteen i left the house with a girl friend and went to work in a factory , she said .
from the factory she went to the country , then returned to the city , where she was arrested and sentenced to hard labor .
maria pablovna never related it herself , but katiousha learned from others that she was sentenced to hard labor because she assumed the guilt of another .
since katiousha came to know her she saw that maria pablovna , everywhere and under all circumstances , never thought of herself , but was always occupied in helping some one else .
one of her present comrades , jesting , said of her that she had given herself up to the sport of charity .
and that was true .
like a sportsman looking for game , her entire activity consisted in finding occasion for serving others .
and this sport became a habit with her , her life aim .
and she did it so naturally that all those that knew her ceased to appreciate it , and demanded it as by right .
when maslova entered their ranks , maria pablovna felt a disgust and loathing for her .
katiousha noticed it .
but she also noticed afterward that maria pablovna , making some effort , became particularly kind and gentle toward her .
the kindness and gentleness of such an uncommon person so affected maslova that she gave herself up to her with her whole soul , unconsciously acquired her glance and involuntarily imitated her in everything .
they were also drawn together by that disgust which both felt toward physical love .
the one hated it , because she had experienced all the horror of it ; the other , because not having experienced it , she looked upon it as something strange and at the same time disgusting and offensive to human dignity .
the influence exerted by maria pablovna over katiousha was due to the fact that katiousha loved maria pablovna .
there was another influence that of simonson , and that was due to the fact that simonson loved katiousha .
simonson decided everything by the light of his reason , and having once decided upon a thing , he never swerved .
while yet a student he made up his mind that the wealth of his father , who was an officer of the commissary department , was dishonestly accumulated .
he then declared to him that his wealth ought to be returned to the people .
and when he was reprimanded he left the house and refused to avail himself of his father means .
having come to the conclusion that all evil can be traced to the people ignorance , he joined the democrats , on leaving the university , and obtaining the position of village teacher , he boldly preached before his pupils and the peasants that which he considered to be just , and denounced that which he considered unjust and false .
he was arrested and prosecuted .
during the trial he decided that the court had no right to judge him , and said so .
the judges disagreeing with him and proceeding with the trial , he concluded not to answer their questions and remained silent .
he was sentenced to exile in the government of archangel .
there he formulated a religious creed defining all his actions .
according to this religious teaching nothing in the world is dead , there is life in everything ; all those things which we consider dead , inorganic , are but parts of a huge organic body which we can not embrace , and that , as a part of a huge organism , man aim should be to conserve the life of that organism and the lives of all its parts .
he therefore considered it a crime to destroy life ; was against war , executions , the killing in any manner not only of human beings , but of animals .
he also had his theory of marriage , according to which the breeding of people was man lower function , his higher function consisting in conserving life already existing .
he found confirmation of this idea in the existence of phagocites in the blood .
bachelors , according to him , were the same phagocites whose function was to help the weak , sickly parts of the organism .
and true to his convictions , he had been performing this function since he became convinced of the truth of the theory , although as a youth he had led a different life .
he called himself , as well as maria pablovna , a phagocite of the world .
his love for katiousha did not violate this theory , since it was purely platonic .
he assumed that such love not only did not prevent his phagocite activity , but aided it .
and it was this man who , falling in love with katiousha , had a decisive influence over her .
with the instincts of a woman , maslova soon discovered it , and the consciousness that she could arouse the feeling of love in such a remarkable man raised her in her own estimation .
nekhludoff offered to marry her out of magnanimity , and the obligation for the past , but simonson loved her as she was now , and loved her simply because he loved her .
she felt , besides , that he considered her an unusual woman , distinguished from all other women , and possessing high moral qualities .
she did not know exactly what those qualities were , but , at all events , not to deceive him , she endeavored with all her power to call forth her best qualities and , necessarily , be as good as she could be .
nekhludoff managed to see maslova only twice between nijhni and perm once in nijhni while the prisoners were being placed on a lighter , and again in the office of the perm prison .
on both occasions he found her secretive and unkind .
when he asked her about her prison conditions , or whether she wanted anything , she became confused and answered evasively and , as it seemed to him , with that hostile feeling of reproach which she had manifested before .
and this gloomy temper , due only to the persecutions to which she was being subjected by the men , tormented him .
but at their very first meeting in tomsk she became again as she was before her departure .
she no longer frowned or became confused when she saw him , but , on the contrary , met him cheerfully and simply , thanking him for what he had done for her , especially for bringing her in contact with her present company .
after two months of journey from prison to prison , this change also manifested itself in her appearance .
she became thin , and apparently older ; wrinkles appeared on her temples and around her mouth ; she no longer curled her hair on her forehead , but wore a on her head , and neither in her dress , coiffure , nor in her conduct were there any signs of her former coquetry .
and this change called forth in nekhludoff a particularly joyous feeling .
the feeling he now experienced toward her was unlike any he had experienced before .
it had nothing in common with his first poetic impulse , nor with that sentimental love which he felt afterward , nor even with that consciousness of a duty performed , coupled with , which impelled him , after the trial , to resolve on marrying her .
it was that same simple feeling of pity and contrition which he experienced at their first meeting in the prison and afterward , with greater force , when he conquered his disgust and forgave her conduct with the physician assistant in the hospital ( the injustice he had done her had subsequently become plain ) .
it was the same feeling with the difference that , while it was temporary then , now it was permanent .
during this period , because of maslova transfer to the politicals , nekhludoff became acquainted with many political prisoners .
on closer acquaintance he was convinced that they were not all villains , as many people imagined them to be , nor all heroes , as some of them considered the members of their party , but that they were ordinary people , among whom , as in other parties , some were good , some bad , the others indifferent .
he became particularly attached to a consumptive young man who was on his way to a life term at hard labor .
the story of the young man was a very short one .
his father , a rich southern landlord , died while he was a child .
he was the only son , and was brought up by his mother .
he was the best scholar in the university , making his specialty mathematics .
he was offered a chair in the university and a course abroad .
but he hesitated .
there was a girl of whom he became enamored , so he contemplated marriage and political activity .
he wished everything , but resolved on nothing .
at that time his college chums asked him for money for a common cause .
he knew what that common cause was , and at the time took no interest in it whatever , but from a feeling of fellowship and egoism gave the money , that it might not be thought that he was afraid .
those who took the money were arrested ; a note was found from which it was learned that the money had been given by kryltzoff .
he was arrested , taken to the police station , then to the prison .
after his discharge he traveled now south , now to petersburg , then abroad , and again to kieff and to odessa .
he was denounced by a man in whom he placed great faith .
he was arrested , tried , kept in prison two years and finally death sentence was imposed on him , but was afterward commuted to hard labor for life .
he was stricken with consumption while in prison , and under the present circumstances had but a few months to live , and he knew it .
at last nekhludoff succeeded in obtaining permission to visit maslova in her cell among the politicals .
while passing the from the headquarters to no .
, escorted by a messenger , he heard a stir and buzzing of voices coming from the dwelling occupied by the prisoners .
and when he came nearer and the door was opened , the buzzing increased and turned into a babel of shouting , cursing and laughing .
a rattling of chains was heard , and a familiar noisome air was wafted from the doorway .
the din of voices with the rattle of chains , and the dreadful odor always produced in nekhludoff the tormenting feeling of some moral nausea , turning into physical nausea .
these two impressions , mingling , strengthened each other .
the apartment occupied by the political prisoners consisted of two small cells , the doors of which opened into the corridor , partitioned off from the rest .
as nekhludoff got beyond the partition he noticed simonson feeding a billet of pine wood into the oven .
spying nekhludoff he looked up without rising and extended his hand .
i am glad you came ; i want to see you !
he said , with a significant glance , looking nekhludoff straight in the eyes .
what is it ?
asked nekhludoff .
i will tell you later ; i am busy now .
and simonson again occupied himself with making the fire , which he did according to his special theory of the greatest conservation of heat energy .
nekhludoff was about to enter the first door when maslova , broom in hand , and sweeping a heap of dirt and dust toward the oven , emerged from the second door .
she wore a white waist and white stockings and her skirt was tucked up under the waist .
a white covered her head to her very eyebrows .
seeing nekhludoff , she unbent herself and , all red and animated , put aside the broom , and wiping her hands on her skirt , she stood still .
you are putting things in order ?
asked nekhludoff , extending his hand .
yes , my old occupation , she answered and smiled .
there is such dirt here ; there is no end to our cleaning .
well , is the plaid dry ?
she turned to simonson .
almost , said simonson , glancing at her in a manner which struck nekhludoff as very peculiar .
then i will fetch the furs to dry .
all our people are there , she said to nekhludoff , going to the further room and pointing to the nearest door .
nekhludoff opened the door and walked into a small cell , dimly lighted by a little metallic lamp standing on a low bunk .
the cell was cold and there was an odor of dust , dampness and tobacco .
the tin lamp threw a bright light on those around it , but the bunks were in the shade and vacillating shadows moved along the walls .
in the small room were all the prisoners , except two men who had gone for boiling water and provisions .
there was an old acquaintance of nekhludoff , the and thin vera efremovna , with her large , frightened eyes and a big vein on her forehead .
she was sitting nervously rolling cigarettes from a heap of tobacco lying on a newspaper in front of her .
in the far corner there was also maria pablovna .
how opportune your coming !
how you seen katia ?
she asked nekhludoff .
there was also anatolie kryltzoff .
pale and wasted , his legs crossed under him , bending forward and shivering , he sat in the far corner , his hands hidden in the sleeves of his fur jacket , and with feverish eyes looked at nekhludoff .
nekhludoff was about to approach him , but to the right of the entrance , sorting something in a bag and talking to the pretty and smiling grabetz , sat a man with curly red hair , in a rubber jacket and with spectacles .
his name was novodvoroff , and nekhludoff hastened to greet him .
of all political prisoners , nekhludoff liked him best .
novodvoroff glanced over his spectacles at nekhludoff and , frowning , he extended his thin hand .
well , are you enjoying your journey ?
he said , evidently in irony .
yes , there are many interesting things , answered nekhludoff , pretending not to see the irony , and treating it as a civility .
then he went over to kryltzoff .
in appearance nekhludoff seemed to be indifferent , but in reality he was far from being so to novodvoroff .
these words of novodvoroff , and his evident desire to say something unpleasant , jarred upon his kindly sentiments , and he became gloomy and despondent .
well , how is your health ?
he said , pressing kryltzoff cold and trembling hand .
pretty fair , only i can not get warm ; i am all wet , said kryltzoff , hastily hiding his hand in the sleeve of his coat .
those windows are broken .
he pointed to the windows behind the iron gratings .
why did you not come before ?
expecting to have a private conversation with katiousha , nekhludoff sat conversing with kryltzoff .
kryltzoff listened attentively , fixedly gazing at nekhludoff .
yes , he said , suddenly , i have often thought that we were going into exile with those very people on account of whom we were banished .
and yet we not only do not know them , but do not wish to know them .
and , worse of all , they hate us and consider us their enemies .
this is dreadful .
there is nothing dreadful about it , said novodvoroff , overhearing the conversation .
the masses are always churlish and ignorant .
at that moment there was an outburst of curses behind the partition wall , followed by a jostling and banging against walls , a clatter of chains , screaming and shouting .
some one was being beaten ; some one shouted help !
see those beasts !
what have they in common with us ?
calmly asked novodvoroff .
you call them beasts , but you should have heard nekhludoff telling of the conduct of one of them , kryltzoff said excitedly .
you are sentimental !
novodvoroff said , ironically .
it is hard for us to understand the emotions of these people and the motives of their acts .
where you see magnanimity , there may only be envy .
why is it you do not wish to see good in others ?
said maria pablovna , suddenly becoming excited .
i can not see that which does not exist .
how can you say it does not exist when a man risks a terrible death ?
i think , said novodvoroff , that if we wish to serve our cause effectively it is necessary that we stop dreaming and look at things as they are .
we must do everything for the masses , and expect nothing from them .
the masses are the object of our activity , but they can not be our collaborators while they are as inert as they are now .
and it is , therefore , perfectly illusive to expect aid from them before they have gone through the process of development that process of development for which we are preparing them .
what process of development ?
said kryltzoff , becoming red in the face .
we say that we are against the use of force , but is this not force in its worst form ?
there is no force here , calmly said novodvoroff .
i only said that i know the path the people must follow , and can point it out .
but how do you know that yours is the right path ?
is it not the same despotism which gave rise to the inquisition and the executions of the great revolution ?
they , too , knew the only scientific path .
the fact that people erred does not prove that i am erring .
besides , there is a great difference between the ravings of ideologists and the data of positive economic science .
novodvoroff voice filled the entire cell .
he alone was speaking ; all the others were silent .
those eternal discussions !
said maria pablovna at a momentary lull .
and what do you think of it ?
nekhludoff asked maria pablovna .
i think that anatolie is right that we have no right to force our ideas on the people .
that is a strange conception of our ideas , said novodvoroff , and he began to smoke angrily .
i can not talk to them , kryltzoff said in a whisper , and became silent .
and it is much better not to talk , said nekhludoff .
an officer entered the cell and announced that the time for departing had arrived .
he counted every prisoner , pointing at every one with his finger .
when he reached nekhludoff he said , familiarly it is too late to remain now , prince ; it is time to go .
nekhludoff , knowing what that meant , approached him and thrust three rubles into his hand .
nothing can be done with you stay here a while longer .
simonson , who was all the while silently sitting on his bunk , his hands clasped behind his head , firmly arose , and carefully making his way through those sitting around the bunk , went over to nekhludoff .
can you hear me now ?
asked simonson .
certainly , said nekhludoff , also rising to follow him .
maslova saw nekhludoff rising , and their eyes meeting , she turned red in the face and doubtfully , as it seemed , shook her head .
my business with you is the following , began simonson , when they reached the corridor .
knowing your relations toward catherine michaelovna , and he looked straight into nekhludoff face , i consider it my duty but at the very door two voices were shouting at the same time .
i tell you , heathen , they are not mine , shouted one voice .
choke yourself , you devil !
the other said , hoarsely .
at that moment maria pablovna entered the corridor .
you can not talk here , she said .
walk in here ; only verotchka is there .
and she opened the door of a tiny cell , evidently intended for solitary confinement , and now at the disposal of the political prisoners .
on one of the bunks lay vera efremovna , with her head covered .
she is ill and asleep ; she can not hear you , and i will go , said maria pablovna .
on the contrary , stay here , said simonson .
i keep nothing secret , especially from you .
very well , said maria pablovna , and childishly moving her whole body from side to side , and thus getting into a snug corner of the bunks , she prepared to listen , at the same time looking somewhere in the distance with her beautiful , sheepish eyes .
well , then , knowing your relations toward catherine michaelovna , i consider it my duty to let you know my relations to her .
well , go on , said nekhludoff , involuntarily admiring simplicity and straightforwardness .
i wished to tell you that i would like to marry catherine michaelovna remarkable !
exclaimed maria pablovna , fixing her gaze on simonson .
and i have decided to ask her to be my wife , continued simonson .
what , then , can i do ?
it depends on her , said nekhludoff .
yes ; but she would not decide the matter without you .
why ?
because , while the question of your relations remains undecided , she can not choose .
on my part the question is definitely decided .
i only wished to do that which i considered it my duty to do , and also to relieve her condition , but in no case did i intend to influence her choice .
yes ; but she does not wish your sacrifice .
there is no sacrifice .
and i also know that her decision is irrevocable .
why , then , talk to me ?
said nekhludoff .
it is necessary for her that you should also approve of it .
i can only say that i am not free , but she is free to do what she wishes .
simonson began to ponder .
very well , i will tell her so .
do not think that i am in love with her , he continued .
i admire her as a good , rare person who has suffered much .
i wish nothing from her , but i would very much like to help her , to relieve her simonson trembling voice surprised nekhludoff .
to relieve her condition , continued simonson .
if she does not wish to accept your help , let her accept mine .
if she consented , i would ask permission to join her in prison .
four years is not an eternity .
i would live near her , and perhaps lighten her fate his emotion again compelled him to stop .
what can i say ?
said nekhludoff .
i am glad that she has found such a protector .
that is just what i wanted to know , continued simonson .
i wished to know whether you , loving her and seeking her good , could approve of her marrying me ?
oh , yes , nekhludoff answered , decisively .
it is all for her ; all i wish is that that woman , who had suffered so much , should have some rest , said simonson , with a childlike gentleness that no one would expect from a man of such gloomy aspect .
simonson rose , took nekhludoff hand , smiled bashfully and embraced him .
well , i will so tell her , he said , and left the room .
what do you think of him ?
said maria pablovna .
in love , and earnestly in love !
i never thought that vladimir simonson could fall in love in such a very stupid , childish fashion .
it is remarkable , and to tell the truth , sad , she concluded , sighing .
but katia ?
how do you think she will take it ?
asked nekhludoff .
she ?
maria pablovna stopped , evidently desiring to give a precise answer .
she ?
you see , notwithstanding her past , she is naturally of a most moral character .
and her feelings are so refined .
she loves you very much so and is happy to be able to do you the negative good of not binding you to herself .
marriage with you would be a dreadful fall to her , worse than all her past .
for this reason she would never consent to it .
at the same time , your presence perplexes her .
ought i then to disappear ?
asked nekhludoff .
maria pablovna smiled in her pleasant , childish way .
yes , partly .
how can i partly disappear ?
i take it back .
but i will tell you that she probably sees the absurdity of that exalted love of his ( he has not spoken to her about it ) , is flattered by it , and fears it .
you know that i am not competent in these matters , but i think that his love is that of the ordinary man , although it is masked .
he says that it rouses his energy and that it is a platonic love ; but it has nothing but nastiness for its basis .
but what am i to do ?
asked nekhludoff .
i think it is best that you have a talk with her .
it is always better to make everything clear .
shall i call her ?
said maria pablovna .
if you please , answered nekhludoff , and maria pablovna went out .
nekhludoff was seized with a strange feeling when , alone in the small cell , he listened to the quiet breathing of vera efremovna , interrupted by an occasional moan , and the constant din coming from the cells of the convicts .
that which simonson had told him freed him from his obligation , which , in a moment of weakness , seemed to him burdensome and dreadful ; and yet it was not only unpleasant , but painful .
the offer of simonson destroyed the exclusiveness of his act , minimized in his own and other people eyes the value of the sacrifice he was making .
if such a good man as simonson , who was under no obligation to her , wished to join his fate to hers , then his own sacrifice was no longer so important .
maybe there was also the ordinary feeling of jealousy ; he was so used to her love that he could not think that she was capable of loving any one else .
besides , his plans were now shattered , especially the plan of living near her while she served her sentence .
if she married simonson , his presence was no longer necessary , and that required a rearrangement of his projects .
he could scarcely collect his thoughts , when katiousha entered the cell .
with quick step she approached him .
maria pablovna sent me , she said , stopping near him .
yes , i would like to talk with you .
take a seat .
vladimir ivanovitch spoke to me .
she seated herself , crossed her hands on her knees , and seemed calm .
but as soon as nekhludoff pronounced simonson name , her face turned a purple color .
what did he tell you ?
she asked .
he told me that he wishes to marry you .
her face suddenly became wrinkled , evidencing suffering , but she remained silent , only looking at the floor .
he asked my consent or advice .
i told him that it all rests with you ; that you must decide .
oh , what is it all for ?
she said , and looked at nekhludoff with that squinting glance that always peculiarly affected him .
for a few seconds they looked silently at each other .
that glance was significant to both .
you must decide , repeated nekhludoff .
decide what ?
she said .
it has all been decided long ago .
it is you who must decide whether you will accept the offer of vladimir ivanovitch , she continued , frowning .
but if a pardon should come ?
said nekhludoff .
oh , leave me alone .
it is useless to talk any more , she answered , and , rising , left the cell .
gaining the street , nekhludoff stopped , and , expanding his chest , drew in the frosty air .
the following morning a soldier brought him a note from maria pablovna , in which she said that kryltzoff condition was worse than they thought it to be .
at one time we intended to remain here with him , but they would not allow it .
so we are taking him with us , but we fear the worst .
try to so arrange in town that if he is left behind some one of us shall remain with him .
if it is necessary for that purpose that i should marry him , then , of course , i am ready to do it .
nekhludoff obtained horses and hastened to catch up with the party of prisoners .
he stopped his team near the wagon carrying kryltzoff on a bed of hay and pillows .
beside kryltzoff sat maria pablovna .
kryltzoff , in a fur coat and lambskin cap , seemed thinner and more pale than before .
his beautiful eyes seemed particularly larger and sparkling .
weakly rolling from side to side from the jostling of the wagon , he steadily looked at nekhludoff , and in answer to questions about his health , he only closed his eyes and angrily shook his head .
it required all his energy to withstand the jostling of the wagon .
maria pablovna exchanged glances with nekhludoff , expressing apprehension concerning kryltzoff condition .
the officer seems to have some shame in him , she shouted , so as to be heard above the rattling of the wheels .
he removed the handcuffs from bouzovkin , who is now carrying his child .
with him are katia , simonson and , in my place , verotchka .
kryltzoff , pointing at maria pablovna , said something which could not , however , be heard .
nekhludoff leaned over him in order to hear him .
then kryltzoff removed the handkerchief , which was tied around his mouth , and whispered now i am better .
if i could only keep from catching cold .
nekhludoff nodded affirmatively and glanced at maria pablovna .
have you received my note , and will you do it ?
asked maria pablovna .
without fail , said nekhludoff , and seeing the dissatisfied face of kryltzoff , went over to his own team , climbed into the wagon , and holding fast to the sides of it , drove along the line of and fettered prisoners which stretched for almost a mile .
nekhludoff crossed the river to a town , and his driver took him to a hotel , where , notwithstanding the poor appointments , he found a measure of comfort entirely wanting in the inns of his stopping places .
he took a bath , dressed himself in city clothes and drove to the governor of the district .
he alighted at a large , handsome building , in front of which stood a sentry and a policeman .
the general was ill , and did not receive .
nekhludoff , nevertheless , asked the porter to take his card to the general , and the porter returned with a favorable answer you are asked to step in .
the vestibule , the porter , the messenger , the shining floor of the hall everything reminded him of petersburg , only it was somewhat dirtier and more majestic .
nekhludoff was admitted to the cabinet .
the general , bloated , with a potato nose and prominent bumps on his forehead , hairless pate and bags under his eyes , a man of sanguine temperament , was reclining in a silk morning gown , and with a cigarette in his hand , was drinking tea from a silver saucer .
how do you do , sir ?
excuse my receiving you in a morning gown ; it is better than not receiving at all , he said , covering his stout , wrinkled neck with the collar of his gown .
i am not quite well , and do not go out .
what brought you into these wilds ?
i was following a party of convicts , among whom is a person near to me , said nekhludoff .
and now i come to see your excellency about that person , and also another affair .
the general inhaled the smoke of his cigarette , took a sip of tea , placed his cigarette in a malachite , and steadily gazing with his watery , shining eyes at nekhludoff , listened gravely .
he only interrupted nekhludoff to ask him if he wished to smoke .
nekhludoff told the general that the person in whom he was interested was a woman , that she was unjustly convicted , and that his clemency had been appealed to .
yes .
well ?
said the general .
i was promised in petersburg that the news of this woman fate would be sent to this place not later than this month .
looking steadily at nekhludoff , the general asked anything else ?
my second request would be concerning the political prisoner who is going to siberia with this detachment .
is that so ?
said the general .
he is very sick he is a dying man .
and he will probably be left here in the hospital ; for this reason one of the female prisoners would like to remain with him .
is she a relative of his ?
no .
but she wishes to marry him , if it will allow her to stay with him .
the general looked sharply at nekhludoff from his shining eyes , and , smoking continually , he kept silence , as if wishing to confound his companion .
when nekhludoff had finished he took a book from the table , and frequently wetting the fingers with which he turned the leaves , he lighted on the chapter treating of marriage and perused it .
what her sentence ?
he asked , lifting his eyes from the book .
hers ?
hard labor .
if this is the case , the sentence can not be changed by marriage .
but i beg your pardon !
if a free man would marry her she would have to serve her sentence all the same .
whose sentence is harder , his or hers ?
both are sentenced to hard labor .
so they are quits , the general said , laughing .
an equal share for both of them .
he may be left here on account of his sickness , he continued , and , of course , everything will be done to ameliorate his condition , but she , even if she should marry him , can not remain here .
anyhow , i will think it over .
what are their names ?
write them down here .
nekhludoff did as he was asked .
and this i can not do either , said the general , concerning his request to see the patient .
of course i do suspect you , but you are interested in them and in others .
you have money , and the people here are corrupt .
how , then , is it possible for me to watch a person who is five thousand miles distant from me ?
there he is king , as i am here , and he began to laugh .
you have surely seen the political prisoners .
you have surely given them money , he added , smiling .
is it so ?
yes , it is true .
i understand that you must act in this way .
you want to see the political prisoner , and you all sorrow for him , and the soldier on guard will surely take money , because he has a family , and his salary amounts to something less than nothing ; he can not afford to refuse .
i would do the same were i in yours or his place .
but , being situated as i am now , i can not permit myself to disobey one iota of the law , for the very reason that i , too , am no more than a man , and am liable to yield to pity .
they confide in me under certain conditions , and i , by my actions , must prove that i am trustworthy .
so this question is settled .
well , now tell me what is going on at the metropolis ?
then the general put various questions , as if he would like to learn some news .
well , tell me now whom you are stopping with at duke ?
it is unpleasant there .
come to us to dinner , he said , finally , dismissing nekhludoff , at five .
do you speak english ?
yes , sir .
well , that is good .
you see , there is an english traveler here .
he is studying the exile system , and the prisons in siberia .
so he will dine with us , and you come , too .
we dine at five , and madam wants us to be punctual .
i will let you know what will be done with that woman , and also with the patient .
maybe it will be possible to leave somebody with him .
having taken leave of the general , nekhludoff drove to the postoffice .
receiving his mail , he walked up to a wooden bench , on which a soldier was sitting , probably waiting for something ; he sat down beside him , and started to look through the letters .
among them he found a registered letter in a beautiful , large envelope , with a large seal of red wax on it .
he tore open the envelope , and , seeing a letter from selenin with some official document , he felt the blood mounting to his cheeks , and his heart grow weak .
this document was the decision concerning katiousha trial .
what was it ?
was it possible that it contained a refusal ?
nekhludoff hastily ran over the letter , written in small , hardly legible , broken handwriting , and breathed freely .
the decision was a favorable one .
dear friend , wrote selenin , our last conversation made a strong impression upon me .
you were right concerning maslova .
i have looked through the accusation .
this could be corrected only through the commission for petitions , to which you sent your petition .
they let me have a copy of the pardon , and here i send it to you , to the address which the countess catherine ivanovna gave me .
i press your hand in friendship .
the news was pleasant and important .
all that nekhludoff could wish for katiousha and himself was realized .
true , those changes in his life changed his relations to her .
but now , he thought , all that was most important was to see her as quick as possible and bring her the good news of her freedom .
he thought that the copy he had in his hand was sufficient for that .
so he bade the cabman drive at once to the prison .
the superintendent of the prison told him that he could not admit him without a permit from the general .
the copy of the petition from their majesty bureau also did not prevail with the superintendent .
he positively refused admittance .
he also refused to admit him to see kryltzoff .
after the disappointment at the prison , nekhludoff drove down to the governor bureau to find out whether they had received there any news concerning the pardon of maslova .
there was no news there , so he drove back to his hotel , and wrote at once to the lawyer and to selenin concerning it .
having finished the letters , he glanced at his watch ; it was already time to go to the general .
on the way he thought again of how he might hand over the pardon to katiousha ; of the place she would be sent to , and how he would live with her .
at dinner in the general house all were not only very friendly to nekhludoff , but , as it seemed , very favorably inclined to him , as he was a new , interesting personality .
the general , who came in to dinner with a white cross on his breast , greeted nekhludoff like an old friend .
on the general inquiry as to what he had done since he saw him in the morning , nekhludoff answered that he had been at the postoffice , that he had found out the facts concerning the pardoning of the person they were talking of in the morning , and he asked permission to visit her .
the general seemed displeased , began to frown and said nothing .
will you have some whisky ?
he said in french to the englishman who had walked up to him .
the englishman took some , and related that he had been to see the cathedral of the city , and the factory , and expressed the desire to see the great jail in which criminals were confined on their way to siberia .
this idea is excellent !
exclaimed the general , turning to nekhludoff .
you may go together .
give them a pass !
he added , turning to his lieutenant .
what time do you wish to go ?
nekhludoff asked the englishman .
i prefer to visit prisons in the evening , the englishman replied .
all are then at home , and there are no preparations .
after dinner , nekhludoff followed her into the , where the englishman was already waiting for him to visit the prison , as they had agreed .
having taken leave of the whole family , he walked out , followed by the englishman .
the sombre looking prison , the soldier on guard , the lantern behind the gate , notwithstanding the pure white layer of snow which had covered everything the sidewalk , the roof and the walls made a gloomy impression .
the proud looking superintendent , walking out to the gate and glancing at nekhludoff pass in the light of the lantern , shrugged his broad shoulders , but obeyed the order and invited the visitors to follow him .
he first led them to the yard , and then to a door on the right hand and up the stairs leading to the office .
offering them seats , he asked them in what way he could serve them , and learning from nekhludoff that he wished to see maslova , he sent the jailer for her and prepared himself to answer the questions which the englishman wished to ask him , before going to the cell .
nekhludoff translated the englishman questions .
while they were conversing they heard approaching footsteps , the door opened and the jailer entered , followed by katiousha in her prison garb , with a scarf tied around her head .
nekhludoff rose and made a few steps toward her .
she said nothing , but her excited expression surprised him .
her face was lit up with a wonderful decision .
he had never seen her look like that .
now the blood rushed to her face , and now she turned pale ; now her fingers twisted convulsively the edges of her jacket , now she looked at him , and now she dropped her eyes .
you know what i called you for ?
asked nekhludoff .
yes , he told me .
but now i am decided .
i will ask permission to go with vladimir ivanovitch .
she said this quickly , as if she had made up her mind before what to say .
how with vladimir ivanovitch ?
asked nekhludoff .
but she interrupted him .
but if he wants me to live with him ?
here she stopped in fear , and added , i mean to stay with him .
i could expect nothing better , and perhaps i may be useful to him and others .
what difference does it make to me ?
one of the two things had happened either she had fallen in love with simonson and did not wish his sacrifice , which weighed so heavily on him , or she was still in love with nekhludoff and renounced him for his own good , burning all bridges behind her , and throwing her fortunes in the same scale with those of simonson .
nekhludoff understood it , and felt ashamed .
if you are in love with him , he said .
i never knew such people , you know .
it is impossible not to love them .
and vladimir is entirely unlike any person i have ever known .
yes , certainly , said nekhludoff .
he is an excellent man , and i think here she interrupted him , as if she were afraid that he would speak too much , or she would not say everything .
you will forgive me for doing that which you did not wish .
you , too , must love .
she said the very thing that he had just said to himself .
but now he was no longer thinking so , but felt altogether different .
he felt not only shame , but pity .
is it possible that all is at an end between us ?
he said .
yes , it looks like it , she answered , with a strange smile .
but nevertheless i would like to be useful to you .
to us , she said , glancing at nekhludoff .
we do need anything .
i am very much obliged to you .
if it were not for you she wished to say something , but her voice began to tremble .
i do know which of us is under greater obligation to the other .
god will settle our accounts , said nekhludoff .
yes , god will settle them , she whispered .
are you ready ?
asked the englishman .
directly , answered nekhludoff , and then he inquired of her what she knew of kryltzoff .
she quieted down and calmly told him kryltzoff became very weak on the road and was taken to the hospital .
maria pablovna wanted to become a nurse , but there is no answer yet .
well , may i go ?
she asked , noticing the englishman who was waiting for him .
i am not yet taking leave of you , said nekhludoff , holding out his hand to her .
pardon me , she said in a low tone .
their eyes met , and in that strange , stern look , and in that pitiful smile , with which she said not , but pardon me , nekhludoff understood , that of the two suppositions concerning her decision the latter was the right one .
she still loved him and thought she would mar his life by a union with him , and would free him by living with simonson .
she pressed his hand , turned quickly , and left the room .
passing through the hall and the corridors , the superintendent passed into the first building of the prison in which those condemned to hard labor were confined .
entering the first room in that building they found the prisoners stretched on their berths , which occupied the middle of the room .
hearing the visitors enter they all jumped down , and , clinking their chains , placed themselves beside their berths , while their heads were distinctly set off against the gloom of the prison .
only two of the prisoners remained at their places .
one of them was a young man whose face was evidently heated with fever ; the other was an old man , who never left off groaning .
the englishman asked whether the young man had been sick for a long time .
the superintendent replied that he had been taken sick that very same morning , that the old man had had convulsions for a long time , and that they kept him in prison because there was no place for him in the hospital .
the englishman shook his head discontentedly , said that he would like to say a few words to the prisoners , and asked nekhludoff to translate his remarks .
it turned out that , besides the aim of his journey , which was the description of the exile system he had another one the preaching of the gospel , of salvation through faith .
tell them that christ pitied and loved them , he said to nekhludoff , and that he died for them .
he who will believe in him will be saved .
while he was saying this , all the prisoners were standing erect with their hands by their sides .
tell them , continued the englishman , that all i said will be found in this book .
are there any among them who can read ?
it turned out that there were more than twenty who could .
the englishman took out a few bibles from his traveling bag , and soon a number of muscular hands , terminating in long black nails , were stretched out toward him , pushing each other aside in order to reach the testaments .
he left two testaments in this room , and went to the next one .
there the same thing occurred .
there prevailed the same dampness and .
but in this room , between the windows , an image of the virgin , before which a small lamp burned dimly , was hung up .
to the left side of the door stood the large vat .
here the prisoners were stretched out on their berths , and in the same way they rose and placed themselves in a row .
three of them remained in their places .
two of these three lifted themselves and sat up , but the third one remained stretched out , and did not even look at the visitors .
these latter ones were sick .
the englishman addressed them in the same manner , and left two testaments .
from the cells in which those condemned to hard labor were imprisoned , they passed over to the cells of the exiles , and finally those in which the relatives who escorted the prisoners to siberia were awaiting the day appointed to start hence .
everywhere the same cold , hungry , idling , sickly , degraded , brutalized human beings could be seen .
the englishman distributed his bibles , and , being tired out , he walked through the rooms saying all right to whatever the superintendent told him concerning the prisons .
they went out into the corridor .
the englishman , pointing to an open door , asked what that room was for .
this is the prison morgue .
oh !
exclaimed the englishman , and he expressed a desire to enter .
this room was an ordinary room .
a small lamp , fastened to the wall , lit up the four bodies which were stretched on berths , with their heads toward the wall and the feet protruding toward the door .
the first body , in a plain shirt , was that of a tall young man , with a small , pointed beard and head .
the corpse was already chilled , and its blue hands were folded over the breast .
beside him , in a white dress and jacket , lay a old woman , with thin hair and wrinkled , yellowish face .
beside this old woman lay a corpse , attired in blue .
this color recalled something in nekhludoff memory .
and who is this third one ?
he asked , mistrusting his own eyesight .
this one is a gentleman who was sent hither from the hospital , replied the superintendent .
nekhludoff walked up to the body and touched the icy cold feet of kryltzoff .
nekhludoff , after parting with the englishman , went straight to his hotel , and walked about his room for a long time .
the affair with katiousha was at an end .
there was something ugly in the very memory of it .
but it was not that which grieved him .
some other affair of his was yet unsettled an affair which tortured him and required his attention .
in his imagination rose the gloomy scenes of the hundreds and thousands of human beings pent up in the pestiferous air .
the laughter of the prisoners resounded in his ears .
he saw again among the dead bodies the beautiful , angry , waxen face of the dead kryltzoff ; and the question whether he was mad , or all those who commit those evils and think themselves wise were mad , bore in upon his mind with renewed power , and he found no answer to it .
the principal difficulty consisted in finding an answer to the principal question , which was what should be done with those who became brutalized in the struggle for life ?
when he became tired walking about the room he sat down on the lounge , close by the lamp , and mechanically opened the bible which the englishman had presented him , and which he had thrown on the table while emptying his pockets .
they say , he thought , that this bible contains the solution to all questions .
so , opening it , he began to read at the place at which it opened itself matt .
, .
after a while he inclined close to the lamp and became like one petrified .
an exultation , the like of which he had not experienced for a long time , took possession of his soul , as though , after long suffering and weariness , he found at last liberty and rest .
he did not sleep the whole night .
as is the case with many who read the bible for the first time , he now , on reading it again , grasped the full meaning of words which he had known long ago , but which he had not understood before .
like a sponge that absorbs everything , so he absorbed everything that was important , necessary and joyful .
that is the principal thing , thought nekhludoff .
we all live in the silly belief that we ourselves are the lords of our world , that this world has been given us for our enjoyment .
but this is evidently untrue .
somebody must have sent us here for some reason .
and for this reason it is plain that we will suffer like those laborers suffer who do not fulfill the wishes of their master .
the will of the lord is expressed in the teachings of christ .
let man obey him , and the kingdom of the lord will come on earth , and man will derive the greatest possible good .
the truth and the kingdom of god , and the rest will come of we seek that which is to come , and do not find it , and not only do we not build the kingdom of god , but we destroy it .
so this will henceforth be the task of my life !
and indeed , from that night a new life began for nekhludoff ; not so much because he had risen into a new stage of existence , but because all that had happened to him till then assumed for him an altogether new meaning .

) how did you come to know it ?
asked nekhludoff , and his face showed disquietude and displeasure .
i was visiting a prisoner , and these people surrounded me and asked what prisoner were you visiting ?
the peasant who is innocently accused , and for whom i have obtained counsel .
but that is not to the point .
is it possible that these innocent people are kept in prison only because they failed to renew their passports ?
- - - - - - well , prince , so genoa and lucca are now just family estates of the buonapartes .
but i warn you , if you don t tell me that this means war , if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that really believe he is will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend , no longer my faithful slave , as you call yourself !
but how do you do ?
i see i have frightened down and tell me all the it was in july , , and the speaker was the anna pávlovna schérer , maid of honor and favorite of the empress márya fëdorovna .
with these words she greeted prince vasíli kurágin , a man of high rank and importance , who was the first to arrive at her reception .
anna pávlovna had had a cough for some days .
she was , as she said , suffering from la grippe ; grippe being then a new word in petersburg , used only by the elite .
all her invitations without exception , written in french , and delivered by a footman that morning , ran as follows if you have nothing better to do , count ( or prince ) , and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible , i shall be very charmed to see you tonight between and heavens !
what a virulent attack ! replied the prince , not in the least disconcerted by this reception .
he had just entered , wearing an embroidered court uniform , knee breeches , and shoes , and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face .
he spoke in that refined french in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought , and with the gentle , patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court .
he went up to anna pávlovna , kissed her hand , presenting to her his bald , scented , and shining head , and complacently seated himself on the sofa .
first of all , dear friend , tell me how you are .
set your friend s mind at rest , said he without altering his tone , beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned .
can one be well while suffering morally ?
can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling ? said anna pávlovna .
you are staying the whole evening , i hope ? and the fete at the english ambassador s ?
today is wednesday .
i must put in an appearance there , said the prince .
my daughter is coming for me to take me i thought today s fete had been canceled .
i confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming if they had known that you wished it , the entertainment would have been put off , said the prince , who , like a clock , by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed .
don t tease !
well , and what has been decided about novosíltsev s dispatch ?
you know what can one say about it ? replied the prince in a cold , listless tone .
what has been decided ?
they have decided that buonaparte has burnt his boats , and i believe that we are ready to burn prince vasíli always spoke languidly , like an actor repeating a stale part .
anna pávlovna schérer on the contrary , despite her forty years , overflowed with animation and impulsiveness .
to be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and , sometimes even when she did not feel like it , she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her .
the subdued smile which , though it did not suit her faded features , always played round her lips expressed , as in a spoiled child , a continual consciousness of her charming defect , which she neither wished , nor could , nor considered it necessary , to correct .
in the midst of a conversation on political matters anna pávlovna burst out oh , don t speak to me of austria .
perhaps i don t understand things , but austria never has wished , and does not wish , for war .
she is betraying us !
russia alone must save europe .
our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it .
that is the one thing i have faith in !
our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth , and he is so virtuous and noble that god will not forsake him .
he will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution , which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain !
we alone must avenge the blood of the just one
whom , i ask you , can we rely on ?
england with her commercial spirit will not and can not understand the emperor alexander s loftiness of soul .
she has refused to evacuate malta .
she wanted to find , and still seeks , some secret motive in our actions .
what answer did novosíltsev get ?
none .
the english have not understood and can not understand the of our emperor who wants nothing for himself , but only desires the good of mankind .
and what have they promised ?
nothing !
and what little they have promised they will not perform !
prussia has always declared that buonaparte is invincible , and that all europe is powerless before him and i don t believe a word that hardenburg says , or haugwitz either .
this famous prussian neutrality is just a trap .
i have faith only in god and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch .
he will save europe ! she suddenly paused , smiling at her own impetuosity .
i think , said the prince with a smile , that if you had been sent instead of our dear wintzingerode you would have captured the king of prussia s consent by assault .
you are so eloquent .
will you give me a cup of tea ? in a moment .
à propos , she added , becoming calm again , i am expecting two very interesting men tonight , le vicomte de mortemart , who is connected with the montmorencys through the rohans , one of the best french families .
he is one of the genuine émigrés , the good ones .
and also the abbé morio .
do you know that profound thinker ?
he has been received by the emperor .
had you heard ? i shall be delighted to meet them , said the prince .
but tell me , he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him , though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit , is it true that the dowager empress wants baron funke to be appointed first secretary at vienna ?
the baron by all accounts is a poor prince vasíli wished to obtain this post for his son , but others were trying through the dowager empress márya fëdorovna to secure it for the baron .
anna pávlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the empress desired or was pleased with .
baron funke has been recommended to the dowager empress by her sister , was all she said , in a dry and mournful tone .
as she named the empress , anna pávlovna s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness , and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness .
she added that her majesty had deigned to show baron funke beaucoup d estime , and again her face clouded over with sadness .
the prince was silent and looked indifferent .
but , with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her , anna pávlovna wished both to rebuke him ( for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the empress ) and at the same time to console him , so she said now about your family .
do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her ?
they say she is amazingly the prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude .
i often think , she continued after a short pause , drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate i often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed .
why has fate given you two such splendid children ?
i don t speak of anatole , your youngest .
i don t like him , she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows .
two such charming children .
and really you appreciate them less than anyone , and so you don t deserve to have and she smiled her ecstatic smile .
i can t help it , said the prince .
lavater would have said i lack the bump of don t joke ; i mean to have a serious talk with you .
do you know i am dissatisfied with your younger son ?
between ourselves ( and her face assumed its melancholy expression ) , he was mentioned at her majesty s and you were pitied the prince answered nothing , but she looked at him significantly , awaiting a reply .
he frowned .
what would you have me do ? he said at last .
you know i did all a father could for their education , and they have both turned out fools .
hippolyte is at least a quiet fool , but anatole is an active one .
that is the only difference between he said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual , so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant .
and why are children born to such men as you ?
if you were not a father there would be nothing i could reproach you with , said anna pávlovna , looking up pensively .
i am your faithful slave and to you alone i can confess that my children are the bane of my life .
it is the cross i have to bear .
that is how i explain it to myself .
it can t be helped ! he said no more , but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture .
anna pávlovna meditated .
have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son anatole ? she asked .
they say old maids have a mania for matchmaking , and though i don t feel that weakness in myself as yet , i know a little person who is very unhappy with her father .
she is a relation of yours , princess mary prince vasíli did not reply , though , with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world , he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information .
do you know , he said at last , evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts , that anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year ?
and , he went on after a pause , what will it be in five years , if he goes on like this ? presently he added that s what we fathers have to put up with is this princess of yours rich ? her father is very rich and stingy .
he lives in the country .
he is the prince bolkónski who had to retire from the army under the late emperor , and was nicknamed the king of he is very clever but eccentric , and a bore .
the poor girl is very unhappy .
she has a brother ; i think you know him , he married lise meinen lately .
he is an of kutúzov s and will be here listen , dear annette , said the prince , suddenly taking anna pávlovna s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards .
arrange that affair for me and i shall always be your most devoted with an f , as a village elder of mine writes in his reports .
she is rich and of good family and that s all i and with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him , he raised the maid of honor s hand to his lips , kissed it , and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair , looking in another direction .
attendez , said anna pávlovna , reflecting , i ll speak to lise , young bolkónski s wife , this very evening , and perhaps the thing can be arranged .
it shall be on your family s behalf that i ll start my apprenticeship as old anna pávlovna s drawing room was gradually filling .
the highest petersburg society was assembled there people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged .
prince vasíli s daughter , the beautiful hélène , came to take her father to the ambassador s entertainment ; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor .
the youthful little princess bolkónskaya , known as la femme la plus séduisante de pétersbourg , was also there .
she had been married during the previous winter , and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings , but only to small receptions .
prince vasíli s son , hippolyte , had come with mortemart , whom he introduced .
the abbé morio and many others had also come .
the most fascinating woman in petersburg .
to each new arrival anna pávlovna said , you have not yet seen my aunt , or you do not know my aunt ? and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady , wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap , who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive ; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt , anna pávlovna mentioned each one s name and then left them .
each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew , not one of them wanted to know , and not one of them cared about ; anna pávlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval .
the aunt spoke to each of them in the same words , about their health and her own , and the health of her majesty , who , thank god , was better and each visitor , though politeness prevented his showing impatience , left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening .
the young princess bolkónskaya had brought some work in a velvet bag .
her pretty little upper lip , on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible , was too short for her teeth , but it lifted all the more sweetly , and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip .
as is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman , her shortness of her upper lip and her to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty .
everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman , so soon to become a mother , so full of life and health , and carrying her burden so lightly .
old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her , after being in her company and talking to her a little while , felt as if they too were becoming , like her , full of life and health .
all who talked to her , and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth , thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day .
the little princess went round the table with quick , short , swaying steps , her workbag on her arm , and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar , as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her .
i have brought my work , said she in french , displaying her bag and addressing all present .
mind , annette , i hope you have not played a wicked trick on me , she added , turning to her hostess .
you wrote that it was to be quite a small reception , and just see how badly i am and she spread out her arms to show her , , dainty gray dress , girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast .
soyez tranquille , lise , you will always be prettier than anyone else , replied anna pávlovna .
you know , said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in french , turning to a general , my husband is deserting me ?
he is going to get himself killed .
tell me what this wretched war is for ? she added , addressing prince vasíli , and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter , the beautiful hélène .
what a delightful woman this little princess is ! said prince vasíli to anna pávlovna .
one of the next arrivals was a stout , heavily built young man with hair , spectacles , the breeches fashionable at that time , a very high ruffle , and a brown dress coat .
this stout young man was an illegitimate son of count bezúkhov , a grandee of catherine s time who now lay dying in moscow .
the young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service , as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated , and this was his first appearance in society .
anna pávlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room .
but in spite of this greeting , a look of anxiety and fear , as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place , came over her face when she saw pierre enter .
though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room , her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy , but observant and natural , expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room .
it is very good of you , monsieur pierre , to come and visit a poor invalid , said anna pávlovna , exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her .
pierre murmured something unintelligible , and continued to look round as if in search of something .
on his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile , as to an intimate acquaintance .
anna pávlovna s alarm was justified , for pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about her majesty s health .
anna pávlovna in dismay detained him with the words do you know the abbé morio ?
he is a most interesting yes , i have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace , and it is very interesting but hardly you think so ? rejoined anna pávlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess .
but pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness .
first he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him , and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away .
with his head bent , and his big feet spread apart , he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abbé s plan chimerical .
we will talk of it later , said anna pávlovna with a smile .
and having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave , she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch , ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag .
as the foreman of a spinning mill , when he has set the hands to work , goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should , and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion , so anna pávlovna moved about her drawing room , approaching now a silent , now a group , and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady , proper , and regular motion .
but amid these cares her anxiety about pierre was evident .
she kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round mortemart to listen to what was being said there , and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abbé .
pierre had been educated abroad , and this reception at anna pávlovna s was the first he had attended in russia .
he knew that all the intellectual lights of petersburg were gathered there and , like a child in a toyshop , did not know which way to look , afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard .
seeing the and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound .
at last he came up to morio .
here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views , as young people are fond of doing .
anna pávlovna s reception was in full swing .
the spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides .
with the exception of the aunt , beside whom sat only one elderly lady , who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society , the whole company had settled into three groups .
one , chiefly masculine , had formed round the abbé .
another , of young people , was grouped round the beautiful princess hélène , prince vasíli s daughter , and the little princess bolkónskaya , very pretty and rosy , though rather too plump for her age .
the third group was gathered round mortemart and anna pávlovna .
the vicomte was a young man with soft features and polished manners , who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself .
anna pávlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests .
as a clever maître d hôtel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat , so anna pávlovna served up to her guests , first the vicomte and then the abbé , as peculiarly choice morsels .
the group about mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the duc d enghien .
the vicomte said that the duc d enghien had perished by his own magnanimity , and that there were particular reasons for buonaparte s hatred of him .
ah , yes !
do tell us all about it , vicomte , said anna pávlovna , with a pleasant feeling that there was something à la louis in the sound of that sentence contez nous çela , the vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply .
anna pávlovna arranged a group round him , inviting everyone to listen to his tale .
the vicomte knew the duc personally , whispered anna pávlovna to one of the guests .
the vicomte is a wonderful raconteur , said she to another .
how evidently he belongs to the best society , said she to a third ; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style , like a joint of roast beef on a hot dish .
the vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile .
come over here , hélène , dear , said anna pávlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off , the center of another group .
the princess smiled .
she rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman .
with a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy , with a gleam of white shoulders , glossy hair , and sparkling diamonds , she passed between the men who made way for her , not looking at any of them but smiling on all , as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders , back , and in the fashion of those days were very much she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward anna pávlovna .
hélène was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry , but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty .
she seemed to wish , but to be unable , to diminish its effect .
how lovely ! said everyone who saw her ; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile .
madame , i doubt my ability before such an audience , said he , smilingly inclining his head .
the princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary .
she smilingly waited .
all the time the story was being told she sat upright , glancing now at her beautiful round arm , altered in shape by its pressure on the table , now at her still more beautiful bosom , on which she readjusted a diamond necklace .
from time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress , and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at anna pávlovna , at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor s face , and again relapsed into her radiant smile .
the little princess had also left the tea table and followed hélène .
wait a moment , i ll get my work now then , what are you thinking of ? she went on , turning to prince hippolyte .
fetch me my there was a general movement as the princess , smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once , sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat .
now i am all right , she said , and asking the vicomte to begin , she took up her work .
prince hippolyte , having brought the workbag , joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her .
le charmant hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister , but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly .
his features were like his sister s , but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous , , youthful , and constant smile of animation , and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure , his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen , while his body was thin and weak .
his eyes , nose , and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant , wearied grimace , and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions .
it s not going to be a ghost story ? said he , sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette , as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak .
why no , my dear fellow , said the astonished narrator , shrugging his shoulders .
because i hate ghost stories , said prince hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them .
he spoke with such that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid .
he was dressed in a dress coat , knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayée , as he called it , shoes , and silk stockings .
the vicomte told his tale very neatly .
it was an anecdote , then current , to the effect that the duc d enghien had gone secretly to paris to visit mademoiselle george ; that at her house he came upon bonaparte , who also enjoyed the famous actress favors , and that in his presence napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject , and was thus at the duc s mercy .
the latter spared him , and this magnanimity bonaparte subsequently repaid by death .
the story was very pretty and interesting , especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another ; and the ladies looked agitated .
charming ! said anna pávlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess .
charming ! whispered the little princess , sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it .
the vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue , but just then anna pávlovna , who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her , noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbé , so she hurried to the rescue .
pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbé about the balance of power , and the latter , evidently interested by the young man s eagerness , was explaining his pet theory .
both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally , which was why anna pávlovna disapproved .
the means are the balance of power in europe and the rights of the people , the abbé was saying .
it is only necessary for one powerful nation like as she is said to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of europe , and it would save the world ! but how are you to get that balance ? pierre was beginning .
at that moment anna pávlovna came up and , looking severely at pierre , asked the italian how he stood russian climate .
the italian s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected , sugary expression , evidently habitual to him when conversing with women .
i am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society , more especially of the feminine society , in which i have had the honor of being received , that i have not yet had time to think of the climate , said he .
not letting the abbé and pierre escape , anna pávlovna , the more conveniently to keep them under observation , brought them into the larger circle .
just then another visitor entered the drawing room prince andrew bolkónski , the little princess husband .
he was a very handsome young man , of medium height , with firm , clearcut features .
everything about him , from his weary , bored expression to his quiet , measured step , offered a most striking contrast to his quiet , little wife .
it was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room , but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them .
and among all these faces that he found so tedious , none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife .
he turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face , kissed anna pávlovna s hand , and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company .
you are off to the war , prince ? said anna pávlovna .
general kutúzov , said bolkónski , speaking french and stressing the last syllable of the general s name like a frenchman , has been pleased to take me as an and lise , your wife ? she will go to the are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife ? andré , said his wife , addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men , the vicomte has been telling us such a tale about mademoiselle george and buonaparte ! prince andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away .
pierre , who from the moment prince andrew entered the room had watched him with glad , affectionate eyes , now came up and took his arm .
before he looked round prince andrew frowned again , expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm , but when he saw pierre s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile .
there now !
so you , too , are in the great world ? said he to pierre .
i knew you would be here , replied pierre .
i will come to supper with you .
may i ? he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story .
no , impossible ! said prince andrew , laughing and pressing pierre s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question .
he wished to say something more , but at that moment prince vasíli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass .
you must excuse me , dear vicomte , said prince vasíli to the frenchman , holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising .
this unfortunate fete at the ambassador s deprives me of a pleasure , and obliges me to interrupt you .
i am very sorry to leave your enchanting party , said he , turning to anna pávlovna .
his daughter , princess hélène , passed between the chairs , lightly holding up the folds of her dress , and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face .
pierre gazed at her with rapturous , almost frightened , eyes as she passed him .
very lovely , said prince andrew .
very , said pierre .
in passing prince vasíli seized pierre s hand and said to anna pávlovna educate this bear for me !
he has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time i have seen him in society .
nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever anna pávlovna smiled and promised to take pierre in hand .
she knew his father to be a connection of prince vasíli s .
the elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook prince vasíli in the anteroom .
all the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear .
how about my son borís , prince ? said she , hurrying after him into the anteroom .
i can t remain any longer in petersburg .
tell me what news i may take back to my poor although prince vasíli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady , even betraying some impatience , she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile , and took his hand that he might not go away .
what would it cost you to say a word to the emperor , and then he would be transferred to the guards at once ? said she .
believe me , princess , i am ready to do all i can , answered prince vasíli , but it is difficult for me to ask the emperor .
i should advise you to appeal to rumyántsev through prince golítsyn .
that would be the best the elderly lady was a princess drubetskáya , belonging to one of the best families in russia , but she was poor , and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections .
she had now come to petersburg to procure an appointment in the guards for her only son .
it was , in fact , solely to meet prince vasíli that she had obtained an invitation to anna pávlovna s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte s story .
prince vasíli s words frightened her , an embittered look clouded her once handsome face , but only for a moment ; then she smiled again and clutched prince vasíli s arm more tightly .
listen to me , prince , said she .
i have never yet asked you for anything and i never will again , nor have i ever reminded you of my father s friendship for you ; but now i entreat you for god s sake to do this for my i shall always regard you as a benefactor , she added hurriedly .
no , don t be angry , but promise !
i have asked golítsyn and he has refused .
be the kindhearted man you always were , she said , trying to smile though tears were in her eyes .
papa , we shall be late , said princess hélène , turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door .
influence in society , however , is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last .
prince vasíli knew this , and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him , he would soon be unable to ask for himself , he became chary of using his influence .
but in princess drubetskáya s case he felt , after her second appeal , something like qualms of conscience .
she had reminded him of what was quite true ; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career .
moreover , he could see by her manners that she was one of those , having once made up their minds , will not rest until they have gained their end , and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour , and even to make scenes .
this last consideration moved him .
my dear anna mikháylovna , said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone , it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask ; but to prove my devotion to you and how i respect your father s memory , i will do the son shall be transferred to the guards .
here is my hand on it .
are you satisfied ? my dear benefactor !
this is what i expected from knew your kindness ! he turned to go .
a word !
when he has been transferred to the guards she faltered .
you are on good terms with michael ilariónovich kutúzov recommend borís to him as adjutant !
then i shall be at rest , and then prince vasíli smiled .
no , i won t promise that .
you don t know how kutúzov is pestered since his appointment as commander in chief .
he told me himself that all the moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as no , but do promise !
i won t let you go !
my dear benefactor papa , said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before , we shall be well , au revoir !
!
you hear her ? then tomorrow you will speak to the emperor ? certainly ; but about kutúzov , i don t do promise , do promise , vasíli ! cried anna mikháylovna as he went , with the smile of a coquettish girl , which at one time probably came naturally to her , but was now very to her careworn face .
apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts .
but as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold , artificial expression .
she returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking , and again pretended to listen , while waiting till it would be time to leave .
her task was accomplished .
and what do you think of this latest comedy , the coronation at milan ? asked anna pávlovna , and of the comedy of the people of genoa and lucca laying their petitions before monsieur buonaparte , and monsieur buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations ?
adorable !
it is enough to make one s head whirl !
it is as if the whole world had gone prince andrew looked anna pávlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile .
dieu me la donne , gare à qui la touche ! they say he was very fine when he said that , he remarked , repeating the words in italian dio mi l ha dato .
guai a chi la tocchi ! god has given it to me , let him who touches it beware !
i hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over , anna pávlovna continued .
the sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to the sovereigns ?
i do not speak of russia , said the vicomte , polite but hopeless the sovereigns , madame what have they done for louis , for the queen , or for madame elizabeth ?
nothing ! and he became more animated .
and believe me , they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the bourbon cause .
the sovereigns !
why , they are sending ambassadors to compliment the and sighing disdainfully , he again changed his position .
prince hippolyte , who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette , suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess , and having asked for a needle began tracing the condé coat of arms on the table .
he explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it .
bâton de gueules , engrêlé de gueules d condé , said he .
the princess listened , smiling .
if buonaparte remains on the throne of france a year longer , the vicomte continued , with the air of a man who , in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else , does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts , things will have gone too far .
by intrigues , violence , exile , and executions , french mean good french have been forever destroyed , and then he shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands .
pierre wished to make a remark , for the conversation interested him , but anna pávlovna , who had him under observation , interrupted the emperor alexander , said she , with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the imperial family , has declared that he will leave it to the french people themselves to choose their own form of government ; and i believe that once free from the usurper , the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king , she concluded , trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant .
that is doubtful , said prince andrew .
monsieur le vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far .
i think it will be difficult to return to the old from what i have heard , said pierre , blushing and breaking into the conversation , almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to bonaparte s it is the buonapartists who say that , replied the vicomte without looking at pierre .
at the present time it is difficult to know the real state of french public bonaparte has said so , remarked prince andrew with a sarcastic smile .
it was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him , though without looking at him .
i showed them the path to glory , but they did not follow it , prince andrew continued after a short silence , again quoting napoleon s words .
i opened my antechambers and they crowded i do not know how far he was justified in saying not in the least , replied the vicomte .
after the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero .
if to some people , he went on , turning to anna pávlovna , he ever was a hero , after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on before anna pávlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte s epigram , pierre again broke into the conversation , and though anna pávlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate , she was unable to stop him .
the execution of the duc d enghien , declared monsieur pierre , was a political necessity , and it seems to me that napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that dieu !
mon dieu ! muttered anna pávlovna in a terrified whisper .
what , monsieur pierre do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul ? said the little princess , smiling and drawing her work nearer to her .
oh !
oh ! exclaimed several voices .
capital ! said prince hippolyte in english , and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand .
the vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders .
pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued .
i say so , he continued desperately , because the bourbons fled from the revolution leaving the people to anarchy , and napoleon alone understood the revolution and quelled it , and so for the general good , he could not stop short for the sake of one man s won t you come over to the other table ? suggested anna pávlovna .
but pierre continued his speech without heeding her .
no , cried he , becoming more and more eager , napoleon is great because he rose superior to the revolution , suppressed its abuses , preserved all that was good in of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the only for that reason did he obtain yes , if having obtained power , without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king , i should have called him a great man , remarked the vicomte .
he could not do that .
the people only gave him power that he might rid them of the bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man .
the revolution was a grand thing ! continued monsieur pierre , betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind .
what ?
revolution and regicide a grand thing ?
well , after that
but won t you come to this other table ? repeated anna pávlovna .
rousseau s contrat social , said the vicomte with a tolerant smile .
i am not speaking of regicide , i am speaking about yes ideas of robbery , murder , and regicide , again interjected an ironical voice .
those were extremes , no doubt , but they are not what is most important .
what is important are the rights of man , emancipation from prejudices , and equality of citizenship , and all these ideas napoleon has retained in full liberty and equality , said the vicomte contemptuously , as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were , words which have long been discredited .
who does not love liberty and equality ?
even our saviour preached liberty and equality .
have people since the revolution become happier ?
on the contrary .
we wanted liberty , but buonaparte has destroyed prince andrew kept looking with an amused smile from pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess .
in the first moment of pierre s outburst anna pávlovna , despite her social experience , was .
but when she saw that pierre s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte , and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him , she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator .
but , my dear monsieur pierre , said she , how do you explain the fact of a great man executing a even an ordinary man innocent and untried ? i should like , said the vicomte , to ask how monsieur explains the brumaire ; was not that an imposture ?
it was a swindle , and not at all like the conduct of a great man ! and the prisoners he killed in africa ?
that was horrible ! said the little princess , shrugging her shoulders .
he s a low fellow , say what you will , remarked prince hippolyte .
pierre , not knowing whom to answer , looked at them all and smiled .
his smile was unlike the of other people .
when he smiled , his grave , even rather gloomy , look was instantaneously replaced by childlike , kindly , even rather silly look , which seemed to ask forgiveness .
the vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested .
all were silent .
how do you expect him to answer you all at once ? said prince andrew .
besides , in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person , as a general , and as an emperor .
so it seems to yes , yes , of course ! pierre chimed in , pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement .
one must admit , continued prince andrew , that napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of arcola , and in the hospital at jaffa where he gave his hand to the ; but but there are other acts which it is difficult to prince andrew , who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of pierre s remarks , rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go .
suddenly prince hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend , and asking them all to be seated began i was told a charming moscow story today and must treat you to it .
excuse me , must tell it in russian or the point will be lost and prince hippolyte began to tell his story in such russian as a frenchman would speak after spending about a year in russia .
everyone waited , so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story .
there is in moscow a lady , une dame , and she is very stingy .
she must have two footmen behind her carriage , and very big ones .
that was her taste .
and she had a lady s maid , also big .
she said here prince hippolyte paused , evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty .
she said oh yes !
she said , girl , to the maid , put on a livery , get up behind the carriage , and come with me while i make some here prince hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience , which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator .
several persons , among them the elderly lady and anna pávlovna , did however smile .
she went .
suddenly there was a great wind .
the girl lost her hat and her long hair came down here he could contain himself no longer and went on , between gasps of laughter and the whole world knew and so the anecdote ended .
though it was unintelligible why he had told it , or why it had to be told in russian , still anna pávlovna and the others appreciated prince hippolyte s social tact in so agreeably ending pierre s unpleasant and unamiable outburst .
after the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls , about theatricals , and who would meet whom , and when and where .
having thanked anna pávlovna for her charming soiree , the guests began to take their leave .
pierre was ungainly .
stout , about the average height , broad , with huge red hands ; he did not know , as the saying is , how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one ; that is , how to say something particularly agreeable before going away .
besides this he was .
when he rose to go , he took up instead of his own , the general s hat , and held it , pulling at the plume , till the general asked him to restore it .
all his and inability to enter a room and converse in it was , however , redeemed by his kindly , simple , and modest expression .
anna pávlovna turned toward him and , with a christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion , nodded and said i hope to see you again , but i also hope you will change your opinions , my dear monsieur when she said this , he did not reply and only bowed , but again everybody saw his smile , which said nothing , unless perhaps , opinions are opinions , but you see what a capital , fellow i and everyone , including anna pávlovna , felt this .
prince andrew had gone out into the hall , and , turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak , listened indifferently to his wife s chatter with prince hippolyte who had also come into the hall .
prince hippolyte stood close to the pretty , pregnant princess , and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass .
go in , annette , or you will catch cold , said the little princess , taking leave of anna pávlovna .
it is settled , she added in a low voice .
anna pávlovna had already managed to speak to lise about the match she contemplated between anatole and the little princess .
i rely on you , my dear , said anna pávlovna , also in a low tone .
write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter .
au revoir !
she left the hall .
prince hippolyte approached the little princess and , bending his face close to her , began to whisper something .
two footmen , the princess and his own , stood holding a shawl and a cloak , waiting for the conversation to finish .
they listened to the french sentences which to them were meaningless , with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so .
the princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh .
i am very glad i did not go to the ambassador s , said prince hippolyte .
it has been a delightful evening , has it not ?
delightful ! they say the ball will be very good , replied the princess , drawing up her downy little lip .
all the pretty women in society will be not all , for you will not be there ; not all , said prince hippolyte smiling joyfully ; and snatching the shawl from the footman , whom he even pushed aside , he began wrapping it round the princess .
either from awkwardness or intentionally ( no one could have said which ) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time , as though embracing her .
still smiling , she gracefully moved away , turning and glancing at her husband .
prince andrew s eyes were closed , so weary and sleepy did he seem .
are you ready ? he asked his wife , looking past her .
prince hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak , which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels , and , stumbling in it , ran out into the porch following the princess , whom a footman was helping into the carriage .
princesse , au revoir , cried he , stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet .
the princess , picking up her dress , was taking her seat in the dark carriage , her husband was adjusting his saber ; prince hippolyte , under pretense of helping , was in everyone s way .
allow me , sir , said prince andrew in russian in a cold , disagreeable tone to prince hippolyte who was blocking his path .
i am expecting you , pierre , said the same voice , but gently and affectionately .
the postilion started , the carriage wheels rattled .
prince hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home .
well , mon cher , said the vicomte , having seated himself beside hippolyte in the carriage , your little princess is very nice , very nice indeed , quite french , and he kissed the tips of his fingers .
hippolyte burst out laughing .
do you know , you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs , continued the vicomte .
i pity the poor husband , that little officer who gives himself the airs of a hippolyte spluttered again , and amid his laughter said , and you were saying that the russian ladies are not equal to the french ?
one has to know how to deal with pierre reaching the house first went into prince andrew s study like one quite at home , and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa , took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand ( it was caesar s commentaries ) , and resting on his elbow , began reading it in the middle .
what have you done to mlle schérer ?
she will be quite ill now , said prince andrew , as he entered the study , rubbing his small white hands .
pierre turned his whole body , making the sofa creak .
he lifted his eager face to prince andrew , smiled , and waved his hand .
that abbé is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light
in my opinion perpetual peace is possible do not know how to express it not by a balance of political power it was evident that prince andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation .
one can t everywhere say all one thinks , mon cher .
well , have you at last decided on anything ?
are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist ? asked prince andrew after a momentary silence .
pierre sat up on the sofa , with his legs tucked under him .
really , i don t yet know .
i don t like either the one or the but you must decide on something !
your father expects pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbé as tutor , and had remained away till he was twenty .
when he returned to moscow his father dismissed the abbé and said to the young man , now go to petersburg , look round , and choose your profession .
i will agree to anything .
here is a letter to prince vasíli , and here is money .
write to me all about it , and i will help you in pierre had already been choosing a career for three months , and had not decided on anything .
it was about this choice that prince andrew was speaking .
pierre rubbed his forehead .
but he must be a freemason , said he , referring to the abbé whom he had met that evening .
that is all prince andrew again interrupted him , let us talk business .
have you been to the horse guards ? no , i have not ; but this is what i have been thinking and wanted to tell you .
there is a war now against napoleon .
if it were a war for freedom i could understand it and should be the first to enter the army ; but to help england and austria against the greatest man in the world is not prince andrew only shrugged his shoulders at pierre s childish words .
he put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense , but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one prince andrew gave to this naïve question .
if no one fought except on his own conviction , there would be no wars , he said .
and that would be splendid , said pierre .
prince andrew smiled ironically .
very likely it would be splendid , but it will never come about well , why are you going to the war ? asked pierre .
what for ?
i don t know .
i must .
besides that i am going he paused .
i am going because the life i am leading here does not suit me ! the rustle of a woman s dress was heard in the next room .
prince andrew shook himself as if waking up , and his face assumed the look it had had in anna pávlovna s drawing room .
pierre removed his feet from the sofa .
the princess came in .
she had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other .
prince andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her .
how is it , she began , as usual in french , settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair , how is it annette never got married ?
how stupid you men all are not to have married her !
excuse me for saying so , but you have no sense about women .
what an argumentative fellow you are , monsieur pierre ! and i am still arguing with your husband .
i can t understand why he wants to go to the war , replied pierre , addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women .
the princess started .
evidently pierre s words touched her to the quick .
ah , that is just what i tell him ! said she .
i don t understand it ; i don t in the least understand why men can t live without wars .
how is it that we women don t want anything of the kind , don t need it ?
now you shall judge between us .
i always tell him here he is uncle s , a most brilliant position .
he is so well known , so much appreciated by everyone .
the other day at the apráksins i heard a lady asking , is that the famous prince andrew ? i did she laughed .
he is so well received everywhere .
he might easily become to the emperor .
you know the emperor spoke to him most graciously .
annette and i were speaking of how to arrange it .
what do you think ? pierre looked at his friend and , noticing that he did not like the conversation , gave no reply .
when are you starting ? he asked .
oh , don t speak of his going , don t !
i won t hear it spoken of , said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly to the family circle of which pierre was almost a member .
today when i remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off and then you know , andré ( she looked significantly at her husband ) i m afraid , i m afraid ! she whispered , and a shudder ran down her back .
her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides pierre and himself was in the room , and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness .
what is it you are afraid of , lise ?
i don t understand , said he .
there , what egotists men all are all , all egotists !
just for a whim of his own , goodness only knows why , he leaves me and locks me up alone in the with my father and sister , remember , said prince andrew gently .
alone all the same , without my friends and he expects me not to be her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up , giving her not a joyful , but an animal , expression .
she paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before pierre , though the gist of the matter lay in that .
i still can t understand what you are afraid of , said prince andrew slowly , not taking his eyes off his wife .
the princess blushed , and raised her arms with a gesture of despair .
no , andrew , i must say you have changed .
oh , how you have your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier , said prince andrew .
you had better the princess said nothing , but suddenly her short downy lip quivered .
prince andrew rose , shrugged his shoulders , and walked about the room .
pierre looked over his spectacles with naïve surprise , now at him and now at her , moved as if about to rise too , but changed his mind .
why should i mind monsieur pierre being here ? exclaimed the little princess suddenly , her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace .
i have long wanted to ask you , andrew , why you have changed so to me ?
what have i done to you ?
you are going to the war and have no pity for me .
why is it ? lise ! was all prince andrew said .
but that one word expressed an entreaty , a threat , and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words .
but she went on hurriedly you treat me like an invalid or a child .
i see it all !
did you behave like that six months ago ? lise , i beg you to desist , said prince andrew still more emphatically .
pierre , who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this , rose and approached the princess .
he seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself .
calm yourself , princess !
it seems so to you because
i assure you i myself have experienced and so because no , excuse me !
an outsider is out of place here no , don t distress yourself ! prince andrew caught him by the hand .
no , wait , pierre !
the princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with no , he thinks only of himself , muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears .
lise ! said prince andrew dryly , raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted .
suddenly the angry , expression of the princess pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear .
her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband s face , and her own assumed the timid , deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail .
mon dieu , mon dieu ! she muttered , and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead .
good night , lise , said he , rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger .
the friends were silent .
neither cared to begin talking .
pierre continually glanced at prince andrew ; prince andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand .
let us go and have supper , he said with a sigh , going to the door .
they entered the elegant , newly decorated , and luxurious dining room .
everything from the table napkins to the silver , china , and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married .
halfway through supper prince andrew leaned his elbows on the table and , with a look of nervous agitation such as pierre had never before seen on his face , began to one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out .
never , never marry , my dear fellow !
that s my advice never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of , and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is , or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake .
marry when you are old and good for all that is good and noble in you will be lost .
it will all be wasted on trifles .
yes !
yes !
yes !
don t look at me with such surprise .
if you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future , you will feel at every step that for you all is ended , all is closed except the drawing room , where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot !
but what s the good ? and he waved his arm .
pierre took off his spectacles , which made his face seem different and the expression still more apparent , and gazed at his friend in amazement .
my wife , continued prince andrew , is an excellent woman , one of those rare women with whom a man s honor is safe ; but , o god , what would i not give now to be unmarried !
you are the first and only one to whom i mention this , because i like as he said this prince andrew was less than ever like that bolkónski who had lolled in anna pávlovna s easy chairs and with eyes had uttered french phrases between his teeth .
every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement ; his eyes , in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished , now flashed with brilliant light .
it was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times , the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation .
you don t understand why i say this , he continued , but it is the whole story of life .
you talk of bonaparte and his career , said he ( though pierre had not mentioned bonaparte ) , but bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal .
he was free , he had nothing but his aim to consider , and he reached it .
but tie yourself up with a woman and , like a chained convict , you lose all freedom !
and all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret .
drawing rooms , gossip , balls , vanity , and are the enchanted circle i can not escape from .
i am now going to the war , the greatest war there ever was , and i know nothing and am fit for nothing .
i am very amiable and have a caustic wit , continued prince andrew , and at anna pávlovna s they listen to me .
and that stupid set without whom my wife can not exist , and those women
if you only knew what those society women are , and women in general !
my father is right .
selfish , vain , stupid , trivial in s what women are when you see them in their true colors !
when you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them , but there s nothing , nothing , nothing !
no , don t marry , my dear fellow ; don t marry ! concluded prince andrew .
it seems funny to me , said pierre , that you , you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life .
you have everything before you , everything .
and you he did not finish his sentence , but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future .
how can he talk like that ? thought pierre .
he considered his friend a model of perfection because prince andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities pierre lacked , and which might be best described as strength of will .
pierre was always astonished at prince andrew s calm manner of treating everybody , his extraordinary memory , his extensive reading ( he had read everything , knew everything , and had an opinion about everything ) , but above all at his capacity for work and study .
and if pierre was often struck by andrew s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation ( to which he himself was particularly addicted ) , he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength .
even in the best , most friendly and simplest relations of life , praise and commendation are essential , just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly .
my part is played out , said prince andrew .
what s the use of talking about me ?
let us talk about you , he added after a silence , smiling at his reassuring thoughts .
that smile was immediately reflected on pierre s face .
but what is there to say about me ? said pierre , his face relaxing into a careless , merry smile .
what am i ?
an illegitimate son ! he suddenly blushed crimson , and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this .
without a name and without means and it really but he did not say what it really was .
for the present i am free and am all right .
only i haven t the least idea what i am to do ; i wanted to consult you prince andrew looked kindly at him , yet his and affectionate as it a sense of his own superiority .
i am fond of you , especially as you are the one live man among our whole set .
yes , you re all right !
choose what you will ; it s all the same .
you ll be all right anywhere .
but look here give up visiting those kurágins and leading that sort of life .
it suits you so this debauchery , dissipation , and the rest of it ! what would you have , my dear fellow ? answered pierre , shrugging his shoulders .
women , my dear fellow ; women ! i don t understand it , replied prince andrew .
women who are comme il faut , that s a different matter ; but the kurágins set of women , women and wine i don t understand ! pierre was staying at prince vasíli kurágin s and sharing the dissipated life of his son anatole , the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to prince andrew s sister .
do you know ? said pierre , as if suddenly struck by a happy thought , seriously , i have long been thinking of it
leading such a life i can t decide or think properly about anything .
one s head aches , and one spends all one s money .
he asked me for tonight , but i won t you give me your word of honor not to go ? on my honor ! it was past one o clock when pierre left his friend .
it was a cloudless , northern , summer night .
pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home .
but the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night .
it was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night .
on the way pierre remembered that anatole kurágin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening , after which there was generally a drinking bout , finishing with visits of a kind pierre was very fond of .
i should like to go to kurágin s , thought he .
but he immediately recalled his promise to prince andrew not to go there .
then , as happens to people of weak character , he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go .
the thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to prince andrew was of no account , because before he gave it he had already promised prince anatole to come to his gathering ; besides , thought he , all such words of honor are conventional things with no definite meaning , especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead , or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same ! pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort , nullifying all his decisions and intentions .
he went to kurágin s .
reaching the large house near the horse guards barracks , in which anatole lived , pierre entered the lighted porch , ascended the stairs , and went in at the open door .
there was no one in the anteroom ; empty bottles , cloaks , and overshoes were lying about ; there was a smell of alcohol , and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance .
cards and supper were over , but the visitors had not yet dispersed .
pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room , in which were the remains of supper .
a footman , thinking no one saw him , was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses .
from the third room came sounds of laughter , the shouting of familiar voices , the growling of a bear , and general commotion .
some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window .
three others were romping with a young bear , one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others .
i bet a hundred on stevens ! shouted one .
mind , no holding on ! cried another .
i bet on dólokhov ! cried a third .
kurágin , you part our there , leave bruin alone ; here s a bet at one draught , or he loses ! shouted a fourth .
jacob , bring a bottle ! shouted the host , a tall , handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group , without a coat , and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front .
wait a bit , you fellows
here is pétya !
good man ! cried he , addressing pierre .
another voice , from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes , particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring , cried from the window come here ; part the bets ! this was dólokhov , an officer of the semënov regiment , a notorious gambler and duelist , who was living with anatole .
pierre smiled , looking about him merrily .
i don t understand .
what s it all about ? wait a bit , he is not drunk yet !
a bottle here , said anatole , and taking a glass from the table he went up to pierre .
first of all you must drink ! pierre drank one glass after another , looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window , and listening to their chatter .
anatole kept on refilling pierre s glass while explaining that dólokhov was betting with stevens , an english naval officer , that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out .
go on , you must drink it all , said anatole , giving pierre the last glass , or i won t let you go ! no , i won t , said pierre , pushing anatole aside , and he went up to the window .
dólokhov was holding the englishman s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet , addressing himself particularly to anatole and pierre .
dólokhov was of medium height , with curly hair and eyes .
he was about .
like all infantry officers he wore no mustache , so that his mouth , the most striking feature of his face , was clearly seen .
the lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved .
the middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one , and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth ; this , together with the resolute , insolent intelligence of his eyes , produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face .
dólokhov was a man of small means and no connections .
yet , though anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles , dólokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them , including anatole himself , respected him more than they did anatole .
dólokhov could play all games and nearly always won .
however much he drank , he never lost his clearheadedness .
both kurágin and dólokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of petersburg .
the bottle of rum was brought .
the window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen , who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around .
anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window .
he wanted to smash something .
pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame , but could not move it .
he smashed a pane .
you have a try , hercules , said he , turning to pierre .
pierre seized the crossbeam , tugged , and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash .
take it right out , or they ll think i m holding on , said dólokhov .
is the englishman bragging ?
eh ?
is it all right ? said anatole .
, said pierre , looking at dólokhov , who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window , from which the light of the sky , the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset , was visible .
dólokhov , the bottle of rum still in his hand , jumped onto the window sill .
listen ! cried he , standing there and addressing those in the room .
all were silent .
i bet fifty imperials spoke french that the englishman might understand him , but he did not speak it very i bet fifty imperials or do you wish to make it a hundred ? added he , addressing the englishman .
no , fifty , replied the latter .
all right .
fifty imperials that i will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth , sitting outside the window on this spot ( he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window ) and without holding on to anything .
is that right ? quite right , said the englishman .
anatole turned to the englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at englishman was repeating the terms of the wager to him in english .
wait ! cried dólokhov , hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention .
wait a bit , kurágin .
listen !
if anyone else does the same , i will pay him a hundred imperials .
do you understand ? the englishman nodded , but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not .
anatole did not release him , and though he kept nodding to show that he understood , anatole went on translating dólokhov s words into english .
a thin young lad , an hussar of the life guards , who had been losing that evening , climbed on the window sill , leaned over , and looked down .
oh !
oh !
oh ! he muttered , looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement .
shut up ! cried dólokhov , pushing him away from the window .
the lad jumped awkwardly back into the room , tripping over his spurs .
placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily , dólokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs .
pressing against both sides of the window , he adjusted himself on his seat , lowered his hands , moved a little to the right and then to the left , and took up the bottle .
anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill , though it was already quite light .
dólokhov s back in his white shirt , and his curly head , were lit up from both sides .
everyone crowded to the window , the englishman in front .
pierre stood smiling but silent .
one man , older than the others present , suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of dólokhov s shirt .
i say , this is folly !
he ll be killed , said this more sensible man .
anatole stopped him .
don t touch him !
you ll startle him and then he ll be killed .
eh ?
what then ?
eh ? dólokhov turned round and , again holding on with both hands , arranged himself on his seat .
if anyone comes meddling again , said he , emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips , i will throw him down there .
now then ! saying this he again turned round , dropped his hands , took the bottle and lifted it to his lips , threw back his head , and raised his free hand to balance himself .
one of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from dólokhov s back .
anatole stood erect with staring eyes .
the englishman looked on sideways , pursing up his lips .
the man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall .
pierre hid his face , from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear .
all were still .
pierre took his hands from his eyes .
dólokhov still sat in the same position , only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar , and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort .
the bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back .
why is it so long ? thought pierre .
it seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed .
suddenly dólokhov made a backward movement with his spine , and his arm trembled nervously ; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge .
as he began slipping down , his head and arm wavered still more with the strain .
one hand moved as if to clutch the window sill , but refrained from touching it .
pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again .
suddenly he was aware of a stir all around .
he looked up dólokhov was standing on the window sill , with a pale but radiant face .
it s he threw the bottle to the englishman , who caught it neatly .
dólokhov jumped down .
he smelt strongly of rum .
well done !
fine fellow !
there s a bet for you !
devil take you ! came from different sides .
the englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money .
dólokhov stood frowning and did not speak .
pierre jumped upon the window sill .
gentlemen , who wishes to bet with me ?
i ll do the same thing ! he suddenly cried .
even without a bet , there !
tell them to bring me a bottle .
i ll do it bring a bottle ! let him do it , let him do it , said dólokhov , smiling .
what next ?
have you gone mad ?
no one would let you !
why , you go giddy even on a staircase , exclaimed several voices .
i ll drink it !
let s have a bottle of rum ! shouted pierre , banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window .
they seized him by his arms ; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying .
no , you ll never manage him that way , said anatole .
wait a bit and i ll get round him
listen !
i ll take your bet tomorrow , but now we are all going to come on then , cried pierre .
come on !
and we ll take bruin with and he caught the bear , took it in his arms , lifted it from the ground , and began dancing round the room with it .
prince vasíli kept the promise he had given to princess drubetskáya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son borís on the evening of anna pávlovna s soiree .
the matter was mentioned to the emperor , an exception made , and borís transferred into the regiment of semënov guards with the rank of cornet .
he received , however , no appointment to kutúzov s staff despite all anna mikháylovna s endeavors and entreaties .
soon after anna pávlovna s reception anna mikháylovna returned to moscow and went straight to her rich relations , the rostóvs , with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling bóry , who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the guards as a cornet , had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time .
the guards had already left petersburg on the tenth of august , and her son , who had remained in moscow for his equipment , was to join them on the march to radzivílov .
it was natalia s day and the name day of two of the mother and the youngest named nataly .
ever since the morning , carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually , bringing visitors to the countess rostóva s big house on the povarskáya , so well known to all moscow .
the countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate , and who constantly succeeded one another in relays .
the countess was a woman of about , with a thin oriental type of face , evidently worn out with had had twelve .
a languor of motion and speech , resulting from weakness , gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect .
princess anna mikháylovna drubetskáya , who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room , helped to receive and entertain the visitors .
the young people were in one of the inner rooms , not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors .
the count met the guests and saw them off , inviting them all to dinner .
i am very , very grateful to you , mon cher , or ma chère called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone , my dear , whether they were above or below him in i thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping .
but mind you come to dinner or i shall be offended , ma chère !
on behalf of the whole family i beg you to come , mon cher ! these words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation , and with the same expression on his full , cheerful , face , the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick , repeated bows .
as soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room , drew a chair toward him or her , and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live , he swayed to and fro with dignity , offered surmises about the weather , or touched on questions of health , sometimes in russian and sometimes in very bad but french ; then again , like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty , he rose to see some visitors off and , stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch , also asked them to dinner .
sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall , where tables were being set out for eighty people ; and looking at the footmen , who were bringing in silver and china , moving tables , and unfolding damask table linen , he would call dmítri vasílevich , a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs , and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say well , dmítri , you ll see that things are all as they should be ?
that s right !
the great thing is the serving , that s and with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room .
márya lvóvna karágina and her daughter ! announced the countess gigantic footman in his bass voice , entering the drawing room .
the countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband s portrait on it .
i m quite worn out by these callers .
however , i ll see her and no more .
she is so affected .
ask her in , she said to the footman in a sad voice , as if saying very well , finish me a tall , stout , and woman , with a smiling daughter , entered the drawing room , their dresses rustling .
dear countess , what an age she has been laid up , poor child at the razumóvski s ball and countess apráksina
i was so delighted came the sounds of animated feminine voices , interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs .
then one of those conversations began which last out until , at the first pause , the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say , i am so delighted mamma s health and countess apráksina and then , again rustling , pass into the anteroom , put on cloaks or mantles , and drive away .
the conversation was on the chief topic of the day the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of catherine s day , count bezúkhov , and about his illegitimate son pierre , the one who had behaved so improperly at anna pávlovna s reception .
i am so sorry for the poor count , said the visitor .
he is in such bad health , and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him ! what is that ? asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to , though she had already heard about the cause of count bezúkhov s distress some fifteen times .
that s what comes of a modern education , exclaimed the visitor .
it seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked , now in petersburg i hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the you don t say so ! replied the countess .
he chose his friends badly , interposed anna mikháylovna .
prince vasíli s son , he , and a certain dólokhov have , it is said , been up to heaven only knows what !
and they have had to suffer for it .
dólokhov has been degraded to the ranks and bezúkhov s son sent back to moscow .
anatole kurágin s father managed somehow to get his son s affair hushed up , but even he was ordered out of but what have they been up to ? asked the countess .
they are regular brigands , especially dólokhov , replied the visitor .
he is a son of márya ivánovna dólokhova , such a worthy woman , but there , just fancy !
those three got hold of a bear somewhere , put it in a carriage , and set off with it to visit some actresses !
the police tried to interfere , and what did the young men do ?
they tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the moyka canal .
and there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back ! what a nice figure the policeman must have cut , my dear ! shouted the count , dying with laughter .
oh , how dreadful !
how can you laugh at it , count ? yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing .
it was all they could do to rescue the poor man , continued the visitor .
and to think it is cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner !
and he was said to be so well educated and clever .
this is all that his foreign education has done for him !
i hope that here in moscow no one will receive him , in spite of his money .
they wanted to introduce him to me , but i quite declined i have my daughters to why do you say this young man is so rich ? asked the countess , turning away from the girls , who at once assumed an air of inattention .
his children are all illegitimate .
i think pierre also is the visitor made a gesture with her hand .
i should think he has a score of princess anna mikháylovna intervened in the conversation , evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society .
the fact of the matter is , said she significantly , and also in a half whisper , everyone knows count cyril s reputation
he has lost count of his children , but this pierre was his how handsome the old man still was only a year ago ! remarked the countess .
i have never seen a handsomer he is very much altered now , said anna mikháylovna .
well , as i was saying , prince vasíli is the next heir through his wife , but the count is very fond of pierre , looked after his education , and wrote to the emperor about him ; so that in the case of his he is so ill that he may die at any moment , and lorrain has come from one knows who will inherit his immense fortune , pierre or prince vasíli .
forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles !
i know it all very well for prince vasíli told me himself .
besides , cyril vladímirovich is my mother s second cousin .
he s also my bóry s godfather , she added , as if she attached no importance at all to the fact .
prince vasíli arrived in moscow yesterday .
i hear he has come on some inspection business , remarked the visitor .
yes , but between ourselves , said the princess , that is a pretext .
the fact is he has come to see count cyril vladímirovich , hearing how ill he but do you know , my dear , that was a capital joke , said the count ; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening , he turned to the young ladies .
i can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut ! and as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman , his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh , the laugh of one who always eats well and , in particular , drinks well .
so do come and dine with us ! he said .
silence ensued .
the countess looked at her callers , smiling affably , but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave .
the visitor s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother , when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over , and a girl of thirteen , hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock , darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room .
it was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far .
behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar , an officer of the guards , a girl of fifteen , and a plump boy in a short jacket .
the count jumped up and , swaying from side to side , spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in .
ah , here she is ! he exclaimed laughing .
my pet , whose name day it is .
my dear pet ! ma chère , there is a time for everything , said the countess with feigned severity .
you spoil her , ilyá , she added , turning to her husband .
how do you do , my dear ?
i wish you many happy returns of your name day , said the visitor .
what a charming child , she added , addressing the mother .
this , girl , not pretty but full of childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice , with black curls tossed backward , thin bare arms , little legs in drawers , and feet in low just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child , though the child is not yet a young woman .
escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother s paying the least attention to her severe began to laugh .
she laughed , and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock .
do you see ?
my doll mimi you see was all natásha managed to utter ( to her everything seemed funny ) .
she leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud , ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in .
now then , go away and take your monstrosity with you , said the mother , pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness , and turning to the visitor she added she is my youngest natásha , raising her face for a moment from her mother s mantilla , glanced up at her through tears of laughter , and again hid her face .
the visitor , compelled to look on at this family scene , thought it necessary to take some part in it .
tell me , my dear , said she to natásha , is mimi a relation of yours ?
a daughter , i suppose ? natásha did not like the visitor s tone of condescension to childish things .
she did not reply , but looked at her seriously .
meanwhile the younger generation borís , the officer , anna mikháylovna s son ; nicholas , the undergraduate , the count s eldest son ; sónya , the count s niece , and little pétya , his youngest boy , had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces .
evidently in the back rooms , from which they had dashed out so impetuously , the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals , the weather , and countess apráksina .
now and then they glanced at one another , hardly able to suppress their laughter .
the two young men , the student and the officer , friends from childhood , were of the same age and both handsome fellows , though not alike .
borís was tall and fair , and his calm and handsome face had regular , delicate features .
nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression .
dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip , and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm .
nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room .
he evidently tried to find something to say , but failed .
borís on the contrary at once found his footing , and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll mimi when she was still quite a young lady , before her nose was broken ; how she had aged during the five years he had known her , and how her head had cracked right across the skull .
having said this he glanced at natásha .
she turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother , who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter , and unable to control herself any longer , she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her .
borís did not laugh .
you were meaning to go out , weren t you , mamma ?
do you want the carriage ? he asked his mother with a smile .
yes , yes , go and tell them to get it ready , she answered , returning his smile .
borís quietly left the room and went in search of natásha .
the plump boy ran after them angrily , as if vexed that their program had been disturbed .
the only young people remaining in the drawing room , not counting the young lady visitor and the countess eldest daughter ( who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a person ) , were nicholas and sónya , the niece .
sónya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes , thick black plaits coiling twice round her head , and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck .
by the grace of her movements , by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs , and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner , she reminded one of a pretty , kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat .
she evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling , but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army , with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone , and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could , like natásha and borís , escape from the drawing room .
ah yes , my dear , said the count , addressing the visitor and pointing to nicholas , his friend borís has become an officer , and so for friendship s sake he is leaving the university and me , his old father , and entering the military service , my dear .
and there was a place and everything waiting for him in the archives department !
isn t that friendship ? remarked the count in an inquiring tone .
but they say that war has been declared , replied the visitor .
they ve been saying so a long while , said the count , and they ll say so again and again , and that will be the end of it .
my dear , there s friendship for you , he repeated .
he s joining the the visitor , not knowing what to say , shook her head .
it s not at all from friendship , declared nicholas , flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion .
it is not from friendship at all ; i simply feel that the army is my he glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor ; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation .
schubert , the colonel of the pávlograd hussars , is dining with us today .
he has been here on leave and is taking nicholas back with him .
it can t be helped ! said the count , shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him .
i have already told you , papa , said his son , that if you don t wish to let me go , i ll stay .
but i know i am no use anywhere except in the army ; i am not a diplomat or a government don t know how to hide what i as he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at sónya and the young lady visitor .
the little kitten , feasting her eyes on him , seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature .
all right , all right ! said the old count .
he always flares up !
this buonaparte has turned all their heads ; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became emperor .
well , well , god grant it , he added , not noticing his visitor s sarcastic smile .
the elders began talking about bonaparte .
julie karágina turned to young rostóv .
what a pity you weren t at the arkhárovs on thursday .
it was so dull without you , said she , giving him a tender smile .
the young man , flattered , sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile , and engaged the smiling julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of sónya , who blushed and smiled unnaturally .
in the midst of his talk he glanced round at her .
she gave him a passionately angry glance , and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips , she got up and left the room .
all nicholas animation vanished .
he waited for the first pause in the conversation , and then with a distressed face left the room to find sónya .
how plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves ! said anna mikháylovna , pointing to nicholas as he went out .
voisinage , she added .
cousinhood is a dangerous neighborhood .
yes , said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished ; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind , and how much suffering , how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now !
and yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy .
one is always , always anxious !
especially just at this age , so dangerous both for girls and it all depends on the bringing up , remarked the visitor .
yes , you re quite right , continued the countess .
till now i have always , thank god , been my children s friend and had their full confidence , said she , repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them .
i know i shall always be my daughters first confidante , and that if nicholas , with his impulsive nature , does get into mischief ( a boy can t help it ) , he will all the same never be like those petersburg young yes , they are splendid , splendid youngsters , chimed in the count , who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid .
just fancy wants to be an hussar .
what s one to do , my dear ? what a charming creature your younger girl is , said the visitor ; a little volcano ! yes , a regular volcano , said the count .
takes after me !
and what a voice she has ; though she s my daughter , i tell the truth when i say she ll be a singer , a second salomoni !
we have engaged an italian to give her isn t she too young ?
i have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that oh no , not at all too young ! replied the count .
why , our mothers used to be married at twelve or and she s in love with borís already .
just fancy ! said the countess with a gentle smile , looking at borís and went on , evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her now you see if i were to be severe with her and to forbid it goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly ( she meant that they would be kissing ) , but as it is , i know every word she utters .
she will come running to me of her own accord in the evening and tell me everything .
perhaps i spoil her , but really that seems the best plan .
with her elder sister i was yes , i was brought up quite differently , remarked the handsome elder daughter , countess véra , with a smile .
but the smile did not enhance véra s beauty as smiles generally do ; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural , and therefore unpleasant , expression .
véra was , not at all stupid , quick at learning , was well brought up , and had a pleasant voice ; what she said was true and appropriate , yet , strange to say , visitors and countess to look at her as if wondering why she had said it , and they all felt awkward .
people are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them , said the visitor .
what s the good of denying it , my dear ?
our dear countess was too clever with véra , said the count .
well , what of that ?
she s turned out splendidly all the same , he added , winking at véra .
the guests got up and took their leave , promising to return to dinner .
what manners !
i thought they would never go , said the countess , when she had seen her guests out .
when natásha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory .
there she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room , waiting for borís to come out .
she was already growing impatient , and stamped her foot , ready to cry at his not coming at once , when she heard the young man s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly .
at this natásha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there .
borís paused in the middle of the room , looked round , brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform , and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face .
natásha , very still , peered out from her ambush , waiting to see what he would do .
he stood a little while before the glass , smiled , and walked toward the other door .
natásha was about to call him but changed her mind .
let him look for me , thought she .
hardly had borís gone than sónya , flushed , in tears , and muttering angrily , came in at the other door .
natásha checked her first impulse to run out to her , and remained in her hiding place , under an invisible see what went on in the world .
she was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure .
sónya , muttering to herself , kept looking round toward the drawing room door .
it opened and nicholas came in .
sónya , what is the matter with you ?
how can you ? said he , running up to her .
it s nothing , nothing ; leave me alone ! sobbed sónya .
ah , i know what it well , if you do , so much the better , and you can go back to her ! !
look here !
how can you torture me and yourself like that , for a mere fancy ? said nicholas taking her hand .
sónya did not pull it away , and left off crying .
natásha , not stirring and scarcely breathing , watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes .
what will happen now ? thought she .
sónya !
what is anyone in the world to me ?
you alone are everything ! said nicholas .
and i will prove it to i don t like you to talk like well , then , i won t ; only forgive me , sónya ! he drew her to him and kissed her .
oh , how nice , thought natásha ; and when sónya and nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called borís to her .
borís , come here , said she with a sly and significant look .
i have something to tell you .
here , here ! and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding .
borís followed her , smiling .
what is the something ? asked he .
she grew confused , glanced round , and , seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs , picked it up .
kiss the doll , said she .
borís looked attentively and kindly at her eager face , but did not reply .
don t you want to ?
well , then , come here , said she , and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll .
closer , closer ! she whispered .
she caught the young officer by his cuffs , and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face .
and me ?
would you like to kiss me ? she whispered almost inaudibly , glancing up at him from under her brows , smiling , and almost crying from excitement .
borís blushed .
how funny you are ! he said , bending down to her and blushing still more , but he waited and did nothing .
suddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he , embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck , and , tossing back her hair , kissed him full on the lips .
then she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood , hanging her head .
natásha , he said , you know that i love you , but you are in love with me ? natásha broke in .
yes , i am , but please don t let us do like that
in another four years then i will ask for your natásha considered .
thirteen , fourteen , fifteen , sixteen , she counted on her slender little fingers .
all right !
then it s settled ? a smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face .
settled ! replied borís .
forever ? said the little girl .
till death itself ? she took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room .
after receiving her visitors , the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more , but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came to the countess wished to have a talk with the friend of her childhood , princess anna mikháylovna , whom she had not seen properly since she returned from petersburg .
anna mikháylovna , with her but pleasant face , drew her chair nearer to that of the countess .
with you i will be quite frank , said anna mikháylovna .
there are not many left of us old friends !
that s why i so value your anna mikháylovna looked at véra and paused .
the countess pressed her friend s hand .
véra , she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite , how is it you have so little tact ?
don t you see you are not wanted here ?
go to the other girls , or the handsome véra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt .
if you had told me sooner , mamma , i would have gone , she replied as she rose to go to her own room .
but as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting , one pair at each window .
she stopped and smiled scornfully .
sónya was sitting close to nicholas who was copying out some verses for her , the first he had ever written .
borís and natásha were at the other window and ceased talking when véra entered .
sónya and natásha looked at véra with guilty , happy faces .
it was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love ; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in véra .
how often have i asked you not to take my things ? she said .
you have a room of your own , and she took the inkstand from nicholas .
in a minute , in a minute , he said , dipping his pen .
you always manage to do things at the wrong time , continued véra .
you came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of though what she said was quite just , perhaps for that very reason no one replied , and the four simply looked at one another .
she lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand .
and at your age what secrets can there be between natásha and borís , or between you two ?
it s all nonsense ! now , véra , what does it matter to you ? said natásha in defense , speaking very gently .
she seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone .
very silly , said véra .
i am ashamed of you .
secrets indeed ! all have secrets of their own , answered natásha , getting warmer .
we don t interfere with you and i should think not , said véra , because there can never be anything wrong in my behavior .
but i ll just tell mamma how you are behaving with natálya ilyníchna behaves very well to me , remarked borís .
i have nothing to complain don t , borís !
you are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome , said natásha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly .
( she used the word diplomat , which was just then much in vogue among the children , in the special sense they attached to it . )
why does she bother me ? and she added , turning to véra , you ll never understand it , because you ve never loved anyone .
you have no heart !
you are a madame de genlis and nothing more ( this nickname , bestowed on véra by nicholas , was considered very stinging ) , and your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people !
go and flirt with berg as much as you please , she finished quickly .
i shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors well , now you ve done what you wanted , put in said unpleasant things to everyone and upset them .
let s go to the all four , like a flock of scared birds , got up and left the room .
the unpleasant things were said to me , remarked véra , i said none to madame de genlis !
madame de genlis ! shouted laughing voices through the door .
the handsome véra , who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone , smiled and , evidently unmoved by what had been said to her , went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf .
looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer .
in the drawing room the conversation was still going on .
ah , my dear , said the countess , my life is not all roses either .
don t i know that at the rate we are living our means won t last long ?
it s all the club and his easygoing nature .
even in the country do we get any rest ?
theatricals , hunting , and heaven knows what besides !
but don t let s talk about me ; tell me how you managed everything .
i often wonder at you , at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to moscow , to petersburg , to those ministers and great people , and know how to deal with them all !
it s quite astonishing .
how did you get things settled ?
i couldn t possibly do ah , my love , answered anna mikháylovna , god grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction !
one learns many things then , she added with a certain pride .
that lawsuit taught me much .
when i want to see one of those big people i write a note princess desires an interview with so , and then i take a cab and go myself two , three , or four i get what i want .
i don t mind what they think of well , and to whom did you apply about bóry ? asked the countess .
you see yours is already an officer in the guards , while my nicholas is going as a cadet .
there s no one to interest himself for him .
to whom did you apply ? to prince vasíli .
he was so kind .
he at once agreed to everything , and put the matter before the emperor , said princess anna mikháylovna enthusiastically , quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end .
has prince vasíli aged much ? asked the countess .
i have not seen him since we acted together at the rumyántsovs theatricals .
i expect he has forgotten me .
he paid me attentions in those days , said the countess , with a smile .
he is just the same as ever , replied anna mikháylovna , overflowing with amiability .
his position has not turned his head at all .
he said to me , i am sorry i can do so little for you , dear princess .
i am at your yes , he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation .
but , nataly , you know my love for my son i would do anything for his happiness !
and my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one , continued anna mikháylovna , sadly , dropping her voice .
my wretched lawsuit takes all i have and makes no progress .
would you believe it , i have literally not a penny and don t know how to equip she took out her handkerchief and began to cry .
i need five hundred rubles , and have only one note .
i am in such a state my only hope now is in count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov .
if he will not assist his know he is bóry s allow him something for his maintenance , all my trouble will have been thrown away
i shall not be able to equip the countess eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence .
i often think , though , perhaps it s a sin , said the princess , that here lives count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov so rich , all alone that tremendous fortune and what is his life worth ?
it s a burden to him , and bóry s life is only just beginning surely he will leave something to borís , said the countess .
heaven only knows , my dear !
these rich grandees are so selfish .
still , i will take borís and go to see him at once , and i shall speak to him straight out .
let people think what they will of me , it s really all the same to me when my son s fate is at the princess rose .
it s now two o clock and you dine at four .
there will just be and like a practical petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time , anna mikháylovna sent someone to call her son , and went into the anteroom with him .
, my dear , said she to the countess who saw her to the door , and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear , wish me good are you going to count cyril vladímirovich , my dear ? said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom , and he added if he is better , ask pierre to dine with us .
he has been to the house , you know , and danced with the children .
be sure to invite him , my dear .
we will see how tarás distinguishes himself today .
he says count orlóv never gave such a dinner as ours will be ! my dear borís , said princess anna mikháylovna to her son as countess rostóva s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov s house .
my dear borís , said the mother , drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son s arm , be affectionate and attentive to him .
count cyril vladímirovich is your godfather after all , and your future depends on him .
remember that , my dear , and be nice to him , as you so well know how to if only i knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it answered her son coldly .
but i have promised and will do it for your although the hall porter saw someone s carriage standing at the entrance , after scrutinizing the mother and son ( who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches ) and looking significantly at the lady s old cloak , he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses , and , hearing that they wished to see the count , said his excellency was worse today , and that his excellency was not receiving anyone .
we may as well go back , said the son in french .
my dear ! exclaimed his mother imploringly , again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him .
borís said no more , but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak .
my friend , said anna mikháylovna in gentle tones , addressing the hall porter , i know count cyril vladímirovich is very ill that s why i have come
i am a relation .
i shall not disturb him , my friend
i only need see prince vasíli sergéevich he is staying here , is he not ?
please announce the hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs , and turned away .
princess drubetskáya to see prince vasíli sergéevich , he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches , shoes , and a coat , who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing .
the mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large venetian mirror in the wall , and in her shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs .
my dear , she said to her son , once more stimulating him by a touch , you promised me ! the son , lowering his eyes , followed her quietly .
they entered the large hall , from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to prince vasíli .
just as the mother and son , having reached the middle of the hall , were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered , the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and prince vasíli came a velvet coat with a single star on his breast , as was his custom when at leave of a , man .
this was the celebrated petersburg doctor , lorrain .
then it is certain ? said the prince .
prince , humanum est errare , but replied the doctor , swallowing his r s , and pronouncing the latin words with a french accent .
to err is human .
very well , very well seeing anna mikháylovna and her son , prince vasíli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry .
the son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother s face , and he smiled slightly .
ah , prince !
in what sad circumstances we meet again !
and how is our dear invalid ? said she , as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her .
prince vasíli stared at her and at borís questioningly and perplexed .
borís bowed politely .
prince vasíli without acknowledging the bow turned to anna mikháylovna , answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient .
is it possible ? exclaimed anna mikháylovna .
oh , how awful !
it is terrible to think
this is my son , she added , indicating borís .
he wanted to thank you borís bowed again politely .
believe me , prince , a mother s heart will never forget what you have done for i am glad i was able to do you a service , my dear anna mikháylovna , said prince vasíli , arranging his lace frill , and in tone and manner , here in moscow to anna mikháylovna whom he had placed under an obligation , assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in petersburg at anna schérer s reception .
try to serve well and show yourself worthy , added he , addressing borís with severity .
i am glad are you here on leave ? he went on in his usual tone of indifference .
i am awaiting orders to join my new regiment , your excellency , replied borís , betraying neither annoyance at the prince s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation , but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance .
are you living with your mother ? i am living at countess rostóva s , replied borís , again adding , your that is , with ilyá rostóv who married nataly shinshiná , said anna mikháylovna .
i know , i know , answered prince vasíli in his monotonous voice .
i never could understand how nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear !
a perfectly absurd and stupid fellow , and a gambler too , i am but a very kind man , prince , said anna mikháylovna with a pathetic smile , as though she too knew that count rostóv deserved this censure , but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man .
what do the doctors say ? asked the princess after a pause , her worn face again expressing deep sorrow .
they give little hope , replied the prince .
and i should so like to thank uncle once for all his kindness to me and borís .
he is his godson , she added , her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give prince vasíli much satisfaction .
prince vasíli became thoughtful and frowned .
anna mikháylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for count bezúkhov s fortune , and hastened to reassure him .
if it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to uncle , said she , uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern , i know his character noble , upright but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses
they are still young she bent her head and continued in a whisper has he performed his final duty , prince ?
how priceless are those last moments !
it can make things no worse , and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so we women , prince , and she smiled tenderly , always know how to say these things .
i absolutely must see him , however painful it may be for me .
i am used to evidently the prince understood her , and also understood , as he had done at anna pávlovna s , that it would be difficult to get rid of anna mikháylovna .
would not such a meeting be too trying for him , dear anna mikháylovna ? said he .
let us wait until evening .
the doctors are expecting a but one can not delay , prince , at such a moment !
consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake .
ah , it is awful the duties of a christian a door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses , the count s niece , entered with a cold , stern face .
the length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs .
prince vasíli turned to her .
well , how is he ? still the same ; but what can you expect , this noise said the princess , looking at anna mikháylovna as at a stranger .
ah , my dear , i hardly knew you , said anna mikháylovna with a happy smile , ambling lightly up to the count s niece .
i have come , and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle .
i imagine what you have gone through , and she sympathetically turned up her eyes .
the princess gave no reply and did not even smile , but left the room as anna mikháylovna took off her gloves and , occupying the position she had conquered , settled down in an armchair , inviting prince vasíli to take a seat beside her .
borís , she said to her son with a smile , i shall go in to see the count , my uncle ; but you , my dear , had better go to pierre meanwhile and don t forget to give him the rostóvs invitation .
they ask him to dinner .
i suppose he won t go ? she continued , turning to the prince .
on the contrary , replied the prince , who had plainly become depressed , i shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man
here he is , and the count has not once asked for he shrugged his shoulders .
a footman conducted borís down one flight of stairs and up another , to pierre s rooms .
pierre , after all , had not managed to choose a career for himself in petersburg , and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to moscow .
the story told about him at count rostóv s was true .
pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear .
he had now been for some days in moscow and was staying as usual at his father s house .
though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in moscow and that the ladies about his were never favorably disposed toward have used it to turn the count against him , he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father s part of the house .
entering the drawing room , where the princesses spent most of their time , he greeted the ladies , two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud .
it was the eldest who was one who had met anna mikháylovna .
the two younger ones were embroidering both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier .
pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper .
the eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes ; the second assumed precisely the same expression ; while the youngest , the one with the mole , who was of a cheerful and lively disposition , bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw .
she drew her wool down through the canvas and , scarcely able to refrain from laughing , stooped as if trying to make out the pattern .
how do you do , cousin ? said pierre .
you don t recognize me ? i recognize you only too well , too how is the count ?
can i see him ? asked pierre , awkwardly as usual , but unabashed .
the count is suffering physically and mentally , and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental can i see the count ? pierre again asked .
hm
if you wish to kill him , to kill him outright , you can see him olga , go and see whether uncle s beef tea is is almost time , she added , giving pierre to understand that they were busy , and busy making his father comfortable , while evidently he , pierre , was only busy causing him annoyance .
olga went out .
pierre stood looking at the sisters ; then he bowed and said then i will go to my rooms .
you will let me know when i can see and he left the room , followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole .
next day prince vasíli had arrived and settled in the count s house .
he sent for pierre and said to him my dear fellow , if you are going to behave here as you did in petersburg , you will end very badly ; that is all i have to say to you .
the count is very , very ill , and you must not see him at since then pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs .
when borís appeared at his door pierre was pacing up and down his room , stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall , as if running a sword through an invisible foe , and glaring savagely over his spectacles , and then again resuming his walk , muttering indistinct words , shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating .
england is done for , said he , scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen .
mr .
pitt , as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man , is sentenced to but before at that moment imagined himself to be napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the straits of dover and captured pronounce pitt s sentence , he saw a and handsome young officer entering his room .
pierre paused .
he had left moscow when borís was a boy of fourteen , and had quite forgotten him , but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took borís by the hand with a friendly smile .
do you remember me ? asked borís quietly with a pleasant smile .
i have come with my mother to see the count , but it seems he is not yes , it seems he is people are always disturbing him , answered pierre , trying to remember who this young man was .
borís felt that pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself , and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked pierre straight in the face .
count rostóv asks you to come to dinner today , said he , after a considerable pause which made pierre feel uncomfortable .
ah , count rostóv ! exclaimed pierre joyfully .
then you are his son , ilyá ?
only fancy , i didn t know you at first .
do you remember how we went to the sparrow hills with madame jacquot ?
it s such an age you are mistaken , said borís deliberately , with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile .
i am borís , son of princess anna mikháylovna drubetskáya .
rostóv , the father , is ilyá , and his son is nicholas .
i never knew any madame pierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees .
oh dear , what am i thinking about ?
i ve mixed everything up .
one has so many relatives in moscow !
so you are borís ?
of course .
well , now we know where we are .
and what do you think of the boulogne expedition ?
the english will come off badly , you know , if napoleon gets across the channel .
i think the expedition is quite feasible .
if only villeneuve doesn t make a mess of things ! borís knew nothing about the boulogne expedition ; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard villeneuve s name .
we here in moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics , said he in his quiet ironical tone .
i know nothing about it and have not thought about it .
moscow is chiefly busy with gossip , he continued .
just now they are talking about you and your pierre smiled in his way as if afraid for his companion s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret .
but borís spoke distinctly , clearly , and dryly , looking straight into pierre s eyes .
moscow has nothing else to do but gossip , borís went on .
everybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune , though he may perhaps outlive us all , as i sincerely hope he will yes , it is all very horrid , interrupted pierre , very pierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself .
and it must seem to you , said borís flushing slightly , but not changing his tone or attitude , it must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man ? so it does , thought pierre .
but i just wish to say , to avoid misunderstandings , that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people .
we are very poor , but for my own part at any rate , for the very reason that your father is rich , i don t regard myself as a relation of his , and neither i nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from for a long time pierre could not understand , but when he did , he jumped up from the sofa , seized borís under the elbow in his quick , clumsy way , and , blushing far more than borís , began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation .
well , this is strange !
do you suppose i who could think ?
i know very well but borís again interrupted him .
i am glad i have spoken out fully .
perhaps you did not like it ?
you must excuse me , said he , putting pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him , but i hope i have not offended you .
i always make it a rule to speak out well , what answer am i to take ?
will you come to dinner at the rostóvs ? and borís , having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it , became quite pleasant again .
no , but i say , said pierre , calming down , you are a wonderful fellow !
what you have just said is good , very good .
of course you don t know me .
we have not met for such a long time not since we were children .
you might think that i
i understand , quite understand .
i could not have done it myself , i should not have had the courage , but it s splendid .
i am very glad to have made your acquaintance .
it s queer , he added after a pause , that you should have suspected me ! he began to laugh .
well , what of it !
i hope we ll get better acquainted , and he pressed borís hand .
do you know , i have not once been in to see the count .
he has not sent for me
i am sorry for him as a man , but what can one do ? and so you think napoleon will manage to get an army across ? asked borís with a smile .
pierre saw that borís wished to change the subject , and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the boulogne expedition .
a footman came in to summon princess was going .
pierre , in order to make borís better acquaintance , promised to come to dinner , and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into borís eyes .
after he had gone pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time , no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword , but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant , intelligent , and resolute young man .
as often happens in early youth , especially to one who leads a lonely life , he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends .
prince vasíli saw the princess off .
she held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful .
it is dreadful , dreadful ! she was saying , but cost me what it may i shall do my duty .
i will come and spend the night .
he must not be left like this .
every moment is precious .
i can t think why his nieces put it off .
perhaps god will help me to find a way to prepare him !
adieu , prince !
may god support you adieu , ma bonne , answered prince vasíli turning away from her .
oh , he is in a dreadful state , said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage .
he hardly recognizes i don t understand , is his attitude to pierre ? asked the son .
the will will show that , my dear ; our fate also depends on but why do you expect that he will leave us anything ? ah , my dear !
he is so rich , and we are so poor ! well , that is hardly a sufficient reason , mamma oh , heaven !
how ill he is ! exclaimed the mother .
after anna mikháylovna had driven off with her son to visit count cyril vladímirovich bezúkhov , countess rostóva sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes .
at last she rang .
what is the matter with you , my dear ? she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes .
don t you wish to serve me ?
then i ll find you another the countess was upset by her friend s sorrow and humiliating poverty , and was therefore out of sorts , a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid my dear and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness .
i am very sorry , ma am , answered the maid .
ask the count to come to the count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual .
well , little countess ?
what a sauté of game au madère we are to have , my dear !
i tasted it .
the thousand rubles i paid for tarás were not .
he is worth it ! he sat down by his wife , his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair .
what are your commands , little countess ? you see , my dear what s that mess ? she said , pointing to his waistcoat .
it s the sauté , most likely , she added with a smile .
well , you see , count , i want some her face became sad .
oh , little countess ! and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook .
i want a great deal , count !
i want five hundred rubles , and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband s waistcoat .
yes , immediately , immediately !
hey , who s there ? he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons .
send dmítri to me ! dmítri , a man of good family who had been brought up in the count s house and now managed all his affairs , stepped softly into the room .
this is what i want , my dear fellow , said the count to the deferential young man who had entered .
bring me he reflected a moment , yes , bring me seven hundred rubles , yes !
but mind , don t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time , but nice clean ones for the yes , dmítri , clean ones , please , said the countess , sighing deeply .
when would you like them , your excellency ? asked dmítri .
allow me to inform you
but , don t be uneasy , he added , noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger .
i was forgetting do you wish it brought at once ? yes , yes ; just so !
bring it .
give it to the what a treasure that dmítri is , added the count with a smile when the young man had departed .
there is never any impossible with him .
that s a thing i hate !
everything is ah , money , count , money !
how much sorrow it causes in the world , said the countess .
but i am in great need of this you , my little countess , are a notorious spendthrift , said the count , and having kissed his wife s hand he went back to his study .
when anna mikháylovna returned from count bezúkhov s the money , all in clean notes , was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess little table , and anna mikháylovna noticed that something was agitating her .
well , my dear ? asked the countess .
oh , what a terrible state he is in !
one would not know him , he is so ill !
i was only there a few moments and hardly said a word annette , for heaven s sake don t refuse me , the countess began , with a blush that looked very strange on her thin , dignified , elderly face , and she took the money from under the handkerchief .
anna mikháylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment .
this is for borís from me , for his anna mikháylovna was already embracing her and weeping .
the countess wept too .
they wept because they were friends , and because they were kindhearted , and because from to think about such a base thing as money , and because their youth was over
but those tears were pleasant to them both .
countess rostóva , with her daughters and a large number of guests , was already seated in the drawing room .
the count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of turkish pipes .
from time to time he went out to ask hasn t she come yet ? they were expecting márya dmítrievna akhrosímova , known in society as le terrible dragon , a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank , but for common sense and frank plainness of speech .
márya dmítrievna was known to the imperial family as well as to all moscow and petersburg , and both cities wondered at her , laughed privately at her rudenesses , and told good stories about her , while none the less all without exception respected and feared her .
in the count s room , which was full of tobacco smoke , they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto , and about the recruiting .
none of them had yet seen the manifesto , but they all knew it had appeared .
the count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking .
he neither smoked nor talked , but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors , whom he egged on against each other .
one of them was a sallow , civilian with a thin and wrinkled face , already growing old , though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man .
he sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and , having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth , was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes .
this was an old bachelor , shinshín , a cousin of the countess , a man with a sharp tongue as they said in moscow society .
he seemed to be condescending to his companion .
the latter , a fresh , rosy officer of the guards , irreproachably washed , brushed , and buttoned , held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke , letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings .
this was lieutenant berg , an officer in the semënov regiment with whom borís was to travel to join the army , and about whom natásha had teased her elder sister véra , speaking of berg as her the count sat between them and listened attentively .
his favorite occupation when not playing boston , a card game he was very fond of , was that of listener , especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another .
well , then , old chap , mon très honorable alphonse kárlovich , said shinshín , laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary russian expressions with the choicest french was a peculiarity of his speech .
vous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l état ; you want to make something out of your company ? you expect to make an income out of the government .
no , peter nikoláevich ; i only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry .
just consider my own position now , peter nikoláevich berg always spoke quietly , politely , and with great precision .
his conversation always related entirely to himself ; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself .
he could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable , but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction .
consider my position , peter nikoláevich .
were i in the cavalry i should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months , even with the rank of lieutenant ; but as it is i receive two hundred and thirty , said he , looking at shinshín and the count with a joyful , pleasant smile , as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else .
besides that , peter nikoláevich , by exchanging into the guards i shall be in a more prominent position , continued berg , and vacancies occur much more frequently in the foot guards .
then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles !
i even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father , he went on , emitting a smoke ring .
la balance y est a german knows how to skin a flint , as the proverb says , remarked shinshín , moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count .
so that squares matters .
the count burst out laughing .
the other guests seeing that shinshín was talking came up to listen .
berg , oblivious of irony or indifference , continued to explain how by exchanging into the guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the cadet corps ; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he , as senior in the company , might easily succeed to the post ; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment , and how satisfied his father was with him .
berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this , and did not seem to suspect that others , too , might have their own interests .
but all he said was so prettily sedate , and the naïveté of his youthful egotism was so obvious , that he disarmed his hearers .
well , my boy , you ll get along wherever you or i ll warrant , said shinshín , patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa .
berg smiled joyously .
the count , followed by his guests , went into the drawing room .
it was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests , expecting the summons to zakúska , avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk , in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food .
the host and hostess look toward the door , and now and then glance at one another , and the visitors try to guess from these glances who , or what , they are waiting important relation who has not yet arrived , or a dish that is not yet ready .
hors d oeuvres .
pierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across , blocking the way for everyone .
the countess tried to make him talk , but he went on naïvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables .
he was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact .
most of the guests , knowing of the affair with the bear , looked with curiosity at this big , stout , quiet man , wondering how such a clumsy , modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman .
you have only lately arrived ? the countess asked him .
oui , madame , replied he , looking around him .
you have not yet seen my husband ? non , he smiled quite inappropriately .
you have been in paris recently , i believe ?
i suppose it s very very the countess exchanged glances with anna mikháylovna .
the latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man , and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father ; but he answered her , as he had the countess , only in monosyllables .
the other guests were all conversing with one another .
the razumóvskis
it was charming you are very kind countess apráksina was heard on all sides .
the countess rose and went into the ballroom .
márya dmítrievna ? came her voice from there .
herself , came the answer in a rough voice , and márya dmítrievna entered the room .
all the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose .
márya dmítrievna paused at the door .
tall and stout , holding high her head with its gray curls , she stood surveying the guests , and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up .
márya dmítrievna always spoke in russian .
health and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children , she said , in her loud , voice which drowned all others .
well , you old sinner , she went on , turning to the count who was kissing her hand , you re feeling dull in moscow , i daresay ?
nowhere to hunt with your dogs ?
but what is to be done , old man ?
just see how these nestlings are growing up , and she pointed to the girls .
you must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not well , said she , how s my cossack ? ( márya dmítrievna always called natásha a cossack ) and she stroked the child s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand .
i know she s a scamp of a girl , but i like she took a pair of ruby earrings from her huge reticule and , having given them to the rosy natásha , who beamed with the pleasure of her saint fete , turned away at once and addressed herself to pierre .
eh , eh , friend !
come here a bit , said she , assuming a soft high tone of voice .
come here , my friend and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher .
pierre approached , looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles .
come nearer , come nearer , friend !
i used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor , and in your case it s my evident she paused .
all were silent , expectant of what was to follow , for this was clearly only a prelude .
a fine lad !
my word !
a fine lad !
his father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear !
for shame , sir , for shame !
it would be better if you went to the she turned away and gave her hand to the count , who could hardly keep from laughing .
well , i suppose it is time we were at table ? said márya dmítrievna .
the count went in first with márya dmítrievna , the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars , a man of importance to them because nicholas was to go with him to the regiment ; then came anna mikháylovna with shinshín .
berg gave his arm to véra .
the smiling julie karágina went in with nicholas .
after them other couples followed , filling the whole dining hall , and last of all the children , tutors , and governesses followed singly .
the footmen began moving about , chairs scraped , the band struck up in the gallery , and the guests settled down in their places .
then the strains of the count s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks , the voices of visitors , and the soft steps of the footmen .
at one end of the table sat the countess with márya dmítrievna on her right and anna mikháylovna on her left , the other lady visitors were farther down .
at the other end sat the count , with the hussar colonel on his left and shinshín and the other male visitors on his right .
midway down the long table on one side sat the young people véra beside berg , and pierre beside borís ; and on the other side , the children , tutors , and governesses .
from behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases , the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its ribbons , and busily filled his neighbors glasses , not neglecting his own .
the countess in turn , without omitting her duties as hostess , threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair .
at the ladies end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time , at the men s end the voices sounded louder and louder , especially that of the colonel of hussars who , growing more and more flushed , ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests .
berg with tender smiles was saying to véra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling .
borís was telling his new friend pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with natásha , who was sitting opposite .
pierre spoke little but examined the new faces , and ate a great deal .
of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines .
these latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward , wrapped in a napkin , from behind the next man s shoulders and whispered dry madeira hungarian or rhine wine as the case might be .
of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count s monogram that stood before his plate , pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment , gazing with amiability at the other guests .
natásha , who sat opposite , was looking at borís as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time .
sometimes that same look fell on pierre , and that funny lively little girl s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why .
nicholas sat at some distance from sónya , beside julie karágina , to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile .
sónya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy ; now she turned pale , now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what nicholas and julie were saying to one another .
the governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children .
the german tutor was trying to remember all the dishes , wines , and kinds of dessert , in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in germany ; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by .
he frowned , trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine , but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it , but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge .
at the men s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated .
the colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in petersburg and that a copy , which he had himself seen , had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief .
and why the deuce are we going to fight bonaparte ? remarked shinshín .
he has stopped austria s cackle and i fear it will be our turn the colonel was a stout , tall , plethoric german , evidently devoted to the service and patriotically russian .
he resented shinshín s remark .
it is for the reasson , my goot sir , said he , speaking with a german accent , for the reasson zat ze emperor knows zat .
he declares in ze manifessto zat he can not fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter .
then with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto and the wish , which constitutes the emperor s sole and absolute establish peace in europe on firm now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose .
zat , my dear sir , is vy he concluded , drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval .
le proverbe jerome , jerome , do not roam , but turn spindles at home ! ? said shinshín , puckering his brows and smiling .
cela nous convient à merveille .
( ) suvórov knew what he was about ; yet they beat him à plate couture , ( ) and where are we to find suvórovs now ?
je vous demande un peu , ( ) said he , continually changing from french to russian .
do you know the proverb ?
( ) that suits us down to the ground .
( ) hollow .
( ) i just ask you that .
ve must vight to the last of our plood ! said the colonel , thumping the table ; and ve must tie for our emperor , and zen all vill pe vell .
and ve must discuss it as little as he dwelt particularly on the word possible as , he ended , again turning to the count .
zat is how ve old hussars look at it , and zere s an end of it !
and how do you , a young man and a young hussar , how do you judge of it ? he added , addressing nicholas , who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel .
i am quite of your opinion , replied nicholas , flaming up , turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger .
i am convinced that we russians must die or conquer , he concluded , were the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward .
what you said just now was splendid ! said his partner julie .
sónya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while nicholas was speaking .
pierre listened to the colonel s speech and nodded approvingly .
that s fine , said he .
the young man s a real hussar ! shouted the colonel , again thumping the table .
what are you making such a noise about over there ? márya dmítrievna s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table .
what are you thumping the table for ? she demanded of the hussar , and why are you exciting yourself ?
do you think the french are here ? i am speaking ze truce , replied the hussar with a smile .
it s all about the war , the count shouted down the table .
you know my son s going , márya dmítrievna ?
my son is i have four sons in the army but still i don t fret .
it is all in god s hands .
you may die in your bed or god may spare you in a battle , replied márya dmítrievna s deep voice , which easily carried the whole length of the table .
that s true ! once more the conversations concentrated , the ladies at the one end and the men s at the other .
you won t ask , natásha s little brother was saying ; i know you won t ask ! i will , replied natásha .
her face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution .
she half rose , by a glance inviting pierre , who sat opposite , to listen to what was coming , and turning to her mother mamma ! rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice , audible the whole length of the table .
what is it ? asked the countess , startled ; but seeing by her daughter s face that it was only mischief , she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head .
the conversation was hushed .
mamma !
what sweets are we going to have ? and natásha s voice sounded still more firm and resolute .
the countess tried to frown , but could not .
márya dmítrievna shook her fat finger .
cossack ! she said threateningly .
most of the guests , uncertain how to regard this sally , looked at the elders .
you had better take care ! said the countess .
mamma !
what sweets are we going to have ? natásha again cried boldly , with saucy gaiety , confident that her prank would be taken in good part .
sónya and fat little pétya doubled up with laughter .
you see !
i have asked , whispered natásha to her little brother and to pierre , glancing at him again .
ice pudding , but you won t get any , said márya dmítrievna .
natásha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even márya dmítrievna .
márya dmítrievna !
what kind of ice pudding ?
i don t like ice carrot no !
what kind , márya dmítrievna ?
what kind ? she almost screamed ; i want to know ! márya dmítrievna and the countess burst out laughing , and all the guests joined in .
everyone laughed , not at márya dmítrievna s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat márya dmítrievna in this fashion .
natásha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice .
before the ices , champagne was served round .
the band again struck up , the count and countess kissed , and the guests , leaving their seats , went up to congratulate the countess , and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count , with the children , and with one another .
again the footmen rushed about , chairs scraped , and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces , the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count s study .
the card tables were drawn out , sets made up for boston , and the count s visitors settled themselves , some in the two drawing rooms , some in the sitting room , some in the library .
the count , holding his cards fanwise , kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual nap , and laughed at everything .
the young people , at the countess instigation , gathered round the clavichord and harp .
julie by general request played first .
after she had played a little air with variations on the harp , she joined the other young ladies in begging natásha and nicholas , who were noted for their musical talent , to sing something .
natásha , who was treated as though she were grown up , was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy .
what shall we sing ? she said .
the brook , suggested nicholas .
well , then , let s be quick .
borís , come here , said natásha .
but where is sónya ? she looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her .
running into sónya s room and not finding her there , natásha ran to the nursery , but sónya was not there either .
natásha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage .
the chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the rostóv household .
and there in fact was sónya lying face downward on nurse s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest , crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her , hiding her face with her slender fingers , and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook .
natásha s face , which had been so radiantly happy all that saint s day , suddenly changed her eyes became fixed , and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped .
sónya !
what is it ?
what is the matter ?
oo oo oo ! and natásha s large mouth widened , making her look quite ugly , and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why , except that sónya was crying .
sónya tried to lift her head to answer but could not , and hid her face still deeper in the bed .
natásha wept , sitting on the feather bed and hugging her friend .
with an effort sónya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining .
nicholas is going away in a week s time , his papers have come he told me himself but still i should not cry , and she showed a paper she held in her the verses nicholas had written , still , i should not cry , but you can t no one can understand what a soul he has ! and she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul .
it s all very well for you
i am not envious
i love you and borís also , she went on , gaining a little strength ; he is nice there are no difficulties in your way
but nicholas is my cousin one would have to the metropolitan himself and even then it can t be done .
and besides , if she tells mamma ( sónya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so ) that i am spoiling nicholas career and am heartless and ungrateful , while truly god is my witness , and she made the sign of the cross , i love her so much , and all of you , only véra and what for ?
what have i done to her ?
i am so grateful to you that i would willingly sacrifice everything , only i have nothing sónya could not continue , and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed .
natásha began consoling her , but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend s trouble .
sónya , she suddenly exclaimed , as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend s sorrow , i m sure véra has said something to you since dinner ?
hasn t she ? yes , these verses nicholas wrote himself and i copied some others , and she found them on my table and said she d show them to mamma , and that i was ungrateful , and that mamma would never allow him to marry me , but that he ll marry julie .
you see how he s been with her all day natásha , what have i done to deserve it ? and again she began to sob , more bitterly than before .
natásha lifted her up , hugged her , and , smiling through her tears , began comforting her .
sónya , don t believe her , darling !
don t believe her !
do you remember how we and nicholas , all three of us , talked in the sitting room after supper ?
why , we settled how everything was to be .
i don t quite remember how , but don t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was ?
there s uncle shinshín s brother has married his first cousin .
and we are only second cousins , you know .
and borís says it is quite possible .
you know i have told him all about it .
and he is so clever and so good ! said natásha .
don t you cry , sónya , dear love , darling sónya ! and she kissed her and laughed .
véra s spiteful ; never mind her !
and all will come right and she won t say anything to mamma .
nicholas will tell her himself , and he doesn t care at all for natásha kissed her on the hair .
sónya sat up .
the little kitten brightened , its eyes shone , and it seemed ready to lift its tail , jump down on its soft paws , and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should .
do you think so ?
really ?
truly ? she said , quickly smoothing her frock and hair .
really , truly ! answered natásha , pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend s plaits .
both laughed .
well , let s go and sing the come along ! do you know , that fat pierre who sat opposite me is so funny ! said natásha , stopping suddenly .
i feel so happy ! and she set off at a run along the passage .
sónya , shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest , ran after natásha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light , joyous steps .
at the visitors request the young people sang the quartette , the brook , with which everyone was delighted .
then nicholas sang a song he had just learned at nighttime in the moon s fair glow how sweet , as fancies wander free , to feel that in this world there s one who still is thinking but of thee !
that while her fingers touch the harp wafting sweet music o er the lea , it is for thee thus swells her heart , sighing its message out to thee a day or two , then bliss unspoilt , but oh !
till then i can not live !
he had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall , and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery .
pierre was sitting in the drawing room where shinshín had engaged him , as a man recently returned from abroad , in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored pierre .
when the music began natásha came in and walking straight up to pierre said , laughing and blushing mamma told me to ask you to join the i am afraid of mixing the figures , pierre replied ; but if you will be my teacher and lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl .
while the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up , pierre sat down with his little partner .
natásha was perfectly happy ; she was dancing with a man , who had been abroad .
she was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a lady .
she had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold .
assuming quite the pose of a society woman ( heaven knows when and where she had learned it ) she talked with her partner , fanning herself and smiling over the fan .
dear , dear !
just look at her ! exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom , pointing to natásha .
natásha blushed and laughed .
well , really , mamma !
why should you ?
what is there to be surprised at ? in the midst of the third écossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and márya dmítrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors .
they now , stretching themselves after sitting so long , and replacing their purses and pocketbooks , entered the ballroom .
first came márya dmítrievna and the count , both with merry countenances .
the count , with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style , offered his bent arm to márya dmítrievna .
he drew himself up , a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the écossaise was ended , he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery , addressing the first violin semën !
do you know the daniel cooper ? this was the count s favorite dance , which he had danced in his youth .
( strictly speaking , daniel cooper was one figure of the anglaise . )
look at papa ! shouted natásha to the whole company , and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter .
and indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman , who standing beside his tall and stout partner , márya dmítrievna , curved his arms , beat time , straightened his shoulders , turned out his toes , tapped gently with his foot , and , by a smile that broadened his round face more and more , prepared the onlookers for what was to follow .
as soon as the provocatively gay strains of daniel cooper ( somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance ) began to sound , all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic men on one side and the women on the with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry .
just look at the master !
a regular eagle he is ! loudly remarked the nurse , as she stood in one of the doorways .
the count danced well and knew it .
but his partner could not and did not want to dance well .
her enormous figure stood erect , her powerful arms hanging down ( she had handed her reticule to the countess ) , and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance .
what was expressed by the whole of the count s plump figure , in márya dmítrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose .
but if the count , getting more and more into the swing of it , charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet , márya dmítrievna produced no less impression by slight least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning , or stamp her everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity .
the dance grew livelier and livelier .
the other couples could not attract a moment s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so .
all were watching the count and márya dmítrievna .
natásha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress , urging them to look at papa ! though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple .
in the intervals of the dance the count , breathing deeply , waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster .
faster , faster , and faster ; lightly , more lightly , and yet more lightly whirled the count , flying round márya dmítrievna , now on his toes , now on his heels ; until , turning his partner round to her seat , he executed the final pas , raising his soft foot backwards , bowing his perspiring head , smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm , amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by natásha .
both partners stood still , breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs .
that s how we used to dance in our time , ma chère , said the count .
that was a daniel cooper ! exclaimed márya dmítrievna , tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily .
while in the rostóvs ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced , to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered , and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper , count bezúkhov had a sixth stroke .
the doctors pronounced recovery impossible .
after a mute confession , communion was administered to the dying man , preparations made for the sacrament of unction , and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments .
outside the house , beyond the gates , a group of undertakers , who hid whenever a carriage drove up , waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral .
the military governor of moscow , who had been assiduous in sending to inquire after the count s health , came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of catherine s court , count bezúkhov .
the magnificent reception room was crowded .
everyone stood up respectfully when the military governor , having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man , passed out , slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors , clergy , and relatives of the family .
prince vasíli , who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days , escorted him to the door , repeating something to him several times in low tones .
when the military governor had gone , prince vasíli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom , crossing one leg high over the other , leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand .
after sitting so for a while he rose , and , looking about him with frightened eyes , went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house , to the room of the eldest princess .
those who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers , and , whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man s room , grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door , which creaked slightly when opened .
the limits of human life are fixed and may not be o erpassed , said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening naïvely to his words .
i wonder , is it not too late to administer unction ? asked the lady , adding the priest s clerical title , as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject .
ah , madam , it is a great sacrament , replied the priest , passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head .
who was that ?
the military governor himself ? was being asked at the other side of the room .
how he is ! yes , and he is over sixty .
i hear the count no longer recognizes anyone .
they wished to administer the sacrament of i knew someone who received that sacrament seven the second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside lorrain , who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of catherine , leaning his elbow on a table .
beautiful , said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather .
the weather is beautiful , princess ; and besides , in moscow one feels as if one were in the yes , indeed , replied the princess with a sigh .
so he may have something to drink ? lorrain considered .
has he taken his medicine ? the doctor glanced at his watch .
take a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar , and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch .
dere has neffer been a gase , a german doctor was saying to an , dat one liffs after de sird and what a man he was ! remarked the .
and who will inherit his wealth ? he added in a whisper .
it von t go begging , replied the german with a smile .
everyone again looked toward the door , which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to lorrain s instructions .
the german doctor went up to lorrain .
do you think he can last till morning ? asked the german , addressing lorrain in french which he pronounced badly .
lorrain , pursing up his lips , waved a severely negative finger before his nose .
tonight , not later , said he in a low voice , and he moved away with a decorous smile of at being able clearly to understand and state the patient s condition .
meanwhile prince vasíli had opened the door into the princess room .
in this room it was almost dark ; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles .
the room was crowded with small pieces of furniture , whatnots , cupboards , and little tables .
the quilt of a high , white feather bed was just visible behind a screen .
a small dog began to bark .
ah , is it you , cousin ? she rose and smoothed her hair , which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish .
has anything happened ? she asked .
i am so no , there is no change .
i only came to have a talk about business , catiche , muttered the prince , seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated .
you have made the place warm , i must say , he remarked .
well , sit down let s have a catherine .
i thought perhaps something had happened , she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression ; and , sitting down opposite the prince , she prepared to listen .
i wished to get a nap , mon cousin , but i can well , my dear ? said prince vasíli , taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit .
it was plain that this well ? referred to much that they both understood without naming .
the princess , who had a straight , rigid body , abnormally long for her legs , looked directly at prince vasíli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes .
then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh .
this might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion , or of weariness and hope of resting before long .
prince vasíli understood it as an expression of weariness .
and i ? he said ; do you think it is easier for me ?
i am as worn out as a post horse , but still i must have a talk with you , catiche , a very serious prince vasíli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously , now on one side , now on the other , giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room .
his eyes too seemed strange ; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm .
the princess , holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands , looked attentively into prince vasíli s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence , if she had to wait till morning .
well , you see , my dear princess and cousin , catherine semënovna , continued prince vasíli , returning to his theme , apparently not without an inner struggle ; at such a moment as this one must think of everything .
one must think of the future , of all of you
i love you all , like children of my own , as you the princess continued to look at him without moving , and with the same dull expression .
and then of course my family has also to be considered , prince vasíli went on , testily pushing away a little table without looking at her .
you know , catiche , that three sisters , mámontov , and my the count s only direct heirs .
i know , i know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters .
it is no easier for me ; but , my dear , i am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything .
do you know i have sent for pierre ?
the count , pointing to his portrait , definitely demanded that he should be prince vasíli looked questioningly at the princess , but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him .
there is one thing i constantly pray god to grant , mon cousin , she replied , and it is that he would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this yes , yes , of course , interrupted prince vasíli impatiently , rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away .
but in short , the fact is you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property , not to us his direct heirs , but to he has made wills enough ! quietly remarked the princess .
but he can not leave the estate to pierre .
pierre is but , my dear , said prince vasíli suddenly , clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly what if a letter has been written to the emperor in which the count asks for pierre s legitimation ?
do you understand that in consideration of the count s services , his request would be granted ? the princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with .
i can tell you more , continued prince vasíli , seizing her hand , that letter was written , though it was not sent , and the emperor knew of it .
the only question is , has it been destroyed or not ?
if not , then as soon as all is over , and prince vasíli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over , and the count s papers are opened , the will and letter will be delivered to the emperor , and the petition will certainly be granted .
pierre will get everything as the legitimate and our share ? asked the princess smiling ironically , as if anything might happen , only not that .
but , my poor catiche , it is as clear as daylight !
he will then be the legal heir to everything and you won t get anything .
you must know , my dear , whether the will and letter were written , and whether they have been destroyed or not .
and if they have somehow been overlooked , you ought to know where they are , and must find them , because what next ? the princess interrupted , smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes .
i am a woman , and you think we are all stupid ; but i know this an illegitimate son can not inherit un bâtard ! she added , as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to prince vasíli the invalidity of his contention .
a bastard .
well , really , catiche !
can t you understand !
you are so intelligent , how is it you don t see that if the count has written a letter to the emperor begging him to recognize pierre as legitimate , it follows that pierre will not be pierre but will become count bezúkhov , and will then inherit everything under the will ?
and if the will and letter are not destroyed , then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s ensuit !
that s and all that follows therefrom .
i know the will was made , but i also know that it is invalid ; and you , mon cousin , seem to consider me a perfect fool , said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging .
my dear princess catherine semënovna , began prince vasíli impatiently , i came here not to wrangle with you , but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman , a good , kind , true relation .
and i tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the emperor and the will in pierre s favor are among the count s papers , then , my dear girl , you and your sisters are not heiresses !
if you don t believe me , then believe an expert .
i have just been talking to dmítri onúfrich ( the family solicitor ) and he says the at this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess ideas ; her thin lips grew white , though her eyes did not change , and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect .
that would be a fine thing ! said she .
i never wanted anything and i don t she pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress .
and this is is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake ! she cried .
it s splendid !
fine !
i don t want anything , yes , but you are not the only one .
there are your sisters replied prince vasíli .
but the princess did not listen to him .
yes , i knew it long ago but had forgotten .
i knew that i could expect nothing but meanness , deceit , envy , intrigue , and blackest this house do you or do you not know where that will is ? insisted prince vasíli , his cheeks twitching more than ever .
yes , i was a fool !
i still believed in people , loved them , and sacrificed myself .
but only the base , the vile succeed !
i know who has been intriguing ! the princess wished to rise , but the prince held her by the hand .
she had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race .
she gave her companion an angry glance .
there is still time , my dear .
you must remember , catiche , that it was all done casually in a moment of anger , of illness , and was afterwards forgotten .
our duty , my dear , is to rectify his mistake , to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice , and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who who sacrificed everything for him , chimed in the princess , who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast , though he never could appreciate it .
no , mon cousin , she added with a sigh , i shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward , that in this world there is neither honor nor justice .
in this world one has to be cunning and now come , come !
be reasonable .
i know your excellent no , i have a wicked i know your heart , repeated the prince .
i value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me .
don t upset yourself , and let us talk sensibly while there is still time , be it a day or be it but an hour tell me all you know about the will , and above all where it is .
you must know .
we will take it at once and show it to the count .
he has , no doubt , forgotten it and will wish to destroy it .
you understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes ; that is my only reason for being here .
i came simply to help him and now i see it all !
i know who has been know ! cried the princess .
that s not the point , my it s that protégé of yours , that sweet princess drubetskáya , that anna mikháylovna whom i would not take for a housemaid the infamous , vile woman ! do not let us lose any time ah , don t talk to me !
last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile , disgraceful things about us , especially about can t repeat it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight .
i know it was then he wrote this vile , infamous paper , but i thought the thing was we ve got to it at did you not tell me about it sooner ? it s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow , said the princess , ignoring his question .
now i know !
yes ; if i have a sin , a great sin , it is hatred of that vile woman ! almost shrieked the princess , now quite changed .
and what does she come worming herself in here for ?
but i will give her a piece of my mind .
the time will come ! while these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess room , a carriage containing pierre ( who had been sent for ) and anna mikháylovna ( who found it necessary to accompany him ) was driving into the court of count bezúkhov s house .
as the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows , anna mikháylovna , having turned with words of comfort to her companion , realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up .
rousing himself , pierre followed anna mikháylovna out of the carriage , and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him .
he noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door .
while he was getting down from the carriage steps two men , who looked like tradespeople , ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall .
pausing for a moment , pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides .
but neither anna mikháylovna nor the footman nor the coachman , who could not help seeing these people , took any notice of them .
it seems to be all right , pierre concluded , and followed anna mikháylovna .
she hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase , calling to pierre , who was lagging behind , to follow .
though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all , still less why he had to go by the back stairs , yet judging by anna mikháylovna s air of assurance and haste , pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary .
halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who , carrying pails , came running downstairs , their boots clattering .
these men pressed close to the wall to let pierre and anna mikháylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there .
is this the way to the princesses apartments ? asked anna mikháylovna of one of them .
yes , replied a footman in a bold loud voice , as if anything were now permissible ; the door to the left , ma perhaps the count did not ask for me , said pierre when he reached the landing .
i d better go to my own anna mikháylovna paused and waited for him to come up .
ah , my friend ! she said , touching his arm as she had done her son s when speaking to him that afternoon , believe me i suffer no less than you do , but be a man ! but really , hadn t i better go away ? he asked , looking kindly at her over his spectacles .
ah , my dear friend !
forget the wrongs that may have been done you .
think that he is your father perhaps in the agony of she sighed .
i have loved you like a son from the first .
trust yourself to me , pierre .
i shall not forget your pierre did not understand a word , but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger , and he meekly followed anna mikháylovna who was already opening a door .
this door led into a back anteroom .
an old man , a servant of the princesses , sat in a corner knitting a stocking .
pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms .
anna mikháylovna , addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as my dear and my sweet , asked about the princess health and then led pierre along a stone passage .
the first door on the left led into the princesses apartments .
the maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door ( everything in the house was done in haste at that time ) , and pierre and anna mikháylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room , where prince vasíli and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking .
seeing them pass , prince vasíli drew back with obvious impatience , while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might .
this action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on prince vasíli s face so out of keeping with his dignity that pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide .
anna mikháylovna evinced no surprise , she only smiled faintly and sighed , as if to say that this was no more than she had expected .
be a man , my friend .
i will look after your interests , said she in reply to his look , and went still faster along the passage .
pierre could not make out what it was all about , and still less what watching over his interests meant , but he decided that all these things had to be .
from the passage they went into a large , dimly lit room adjoining the count s reception room .
it was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to pierre only from the front approach , but even in this room there now stood an empty bath , and water had been spilled on the carpet .
they were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them .
they went into the reception room familiar to pierre , with two italian windows opening into the conservatory , with its large bust and full length portrait of catherine the great .
the same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before , whispering to one another .
all became silent and turned to look at the pale anna mikháylovna as she entered , and at the big stout figure of pierre who , hanging his head , meekly followed her .
anna mikháylovna s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived .
with the air of a practical petersburg lady she now , keeping pierre close beside her , entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon .
she felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see , her own admission was assured .
casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count s confessor there , she glided up to him with a sort of amble , not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller , and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest .
god be thanked that you are in time , said she to one of the priests ; all we relatives have been in such anxiety .
this young man is the count s son , she added more softly .
what a terrible moment ! having said this she went up to the doctor .
dear doctor , said she , this young man is the count s son .
is there any hope ? the doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders .
anna mikháylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes , almost closing the latter , sighed , and moved away from the doctor to pierre .
to him , in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice , she said trust in his mercy ! and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her , she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it .
pierre , having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly , moved toward the sofa she had indicated .
as soon as anna mikháylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy .
he noticed that they whispered to one another , casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility .
a deference such as he had never before received was shown him .
a strange lady , the one who had been talking to the priests , rose and offered him her seat ; an picked up and returned a glove pierre had dropped ; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by , and moved to make way for him .
at first pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady , and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way ; but all at once he felt that this would not do , and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him , and that he was therefore bound to accept their services .
he took the glove in silence from the , and sat down in the lady s chair , placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the naïve attitude of an egyptian statue , and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be , and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight , but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him .
not two minutes had passed before prince vasíli with head erect majestically entered the room .
he was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast .
he seemed to have grown thinner since the morning ; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed pierre .
he went up to him , took his hand ( a thing he never used to do ) , and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on .
courage , courage , my friend !
he has asked to see you .
that is well ! and he turned to go .
but pierre thought it necessary to ask how is and hesitated , not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man the count , yet ashamed to call him he had another stroke about half an hour ago .
courage , my friend pierre s mind was in such a confused state that the word stroke suggested to him a blow from something .
he looked at prince vasíli in perplexity , and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness .
prince vasíli said something to lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe .
he could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step .
the eldest princess followed him , and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door .
through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about , and at last anna mikháylovna , still with the same expression , pale but resolute in the discharge of duty , ran out and touching pierre lightly on the arm said the divine mercy is inexhaustible !
unction is about to be administered .
pierre went in at the door , stepping on the soft carpet , and noticed that the strange lady , the , and some of the servants , all followed him in , as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room .
pierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch , its walls hung round with persian carpets .
the part of the room behind the columns , with a high mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons , was brightly illuminated with red light like a russian church during evening service .
under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair , and in that chair on smooth pillows , evidently freshly changed , pierre to the waist by a bright green familiar , majestic figure of his father , count bezúkhov , with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion , and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome , ruddy face .
he lay just under the icons ; his large thick hands outside the quilt .
into the right hand , which was lying palm downwards , a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb , and an old servant , bending over from behind the chair , held it in position .
by the chair stood the priests , their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments , with lighted tapers in their hands , slowly and solemnly conducting the service .
a little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes , and just in front of them their eldest sister , catiche , with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons , as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round .
anna mikháylovna , with a meek , sorrowful , and expression on her face , stood by the door near the strange lady .
prince vasíli in front of the door , near the invalid chair , a wax taper in his left hand , was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose , and was crossing himself with his right hand , turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead .
his face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of god .
if you do not understand these sentiments , he seemed to be saying , so much the worse for you ! behind him stood the , the doctors , and the menservants ; the men and women had separated as in church .
all were silently crossing themselves , and the reading of the church service , the subdued chanting of deep bass voices , and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard .
anna mikháylovna , with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about , went across the room to where pierre was standing and gave him a taper .
he lit it and , distracted by observing those around him , began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper .
sophie , the rosy , , youngest princess with the mole , watched him .
she smiled , hid her face in her handkerchief , and remained with it hidden for awhile ; then looking up and seeing pierre she again began to laugh .
she evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing , but could not resist looking at him so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns .
in the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased , they whispered to one another , and the old servant who was holding the count s hand got up and said something to the ladies .
anna mikháylovna stepped forward and , stooping over the dying man , beckoned to lorrain from behind her back .
the french doctor held no taper ; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he , a foreigner , in spite of all differences of faith , understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it .
he now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life , with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free , and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment .
the sick man was given something to drink , there was a stir around him , then the people resumed their places and the service continued .
during this interval pierre noticed that prince vasíli left the chair on which he had been leaning , an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for not go up to the dying man , but passed by him , joined the eldest princess , and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings .
on leaving the bed both prince vasíli and the princess passed out by a back door , but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded .
pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on , having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential .
the chanting of the service ceased , and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament .
the dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before .
around him everyone began to stir steps were audible and whispers , among which anna mikháylovna s was the most distinct .
pierre heard her say certainly he must be moved onto the bed ; here it will be impossible the sick man was so surrounded by doctors , princesses , and servants that pierre could no longer see the face with its gray , though he saw other faces as well , he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service .
he judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him .
catch hold of my arm or you ll drop him ! he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper .
catch hold from underneath .
here ! exclaimed different voices ; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried , as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them .
as the bearers , among whom was anna mikháylovna , passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man s high , stout , uncovered chest and powerful shoulders , raised by those who were holding him under the armpits , and of his gray , curly , leonine head .
this head , with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones , its handsome , sensual mouth , and its cold , majestic expression , was not disfigured by the approach of death .
it was the same as pierre remembered it three months before , when the count had sent him to petersburg .
but now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers , and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing .
after a few minutes bustle beside the high bedstead , those who had carried the sick man dispersed .
anna mikháylovna touched pierre s hand and said , pierre went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed .
he lay with his head propped high on the pillows .
his hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt , the palms downward .
when pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him , but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man .
either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere , or it meant too much .
pierre hesitated , not knowing what to do , and glanced inquiringly at his guide .
anna mikháylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes , glancing at the sick man s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss .
pierre , carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt , followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned , fleshy hand .
neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count s face stirred .
once more pierre looked questioningly at anna mikháylovna to see what he was to do next .
anna mikháylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed .
pierre obediently sat down , his eyes asking if he were doing right .
anna mikháylovna nodded approvingly .
again pierre fell into the naïvely symmetrical pose of an egyptian statue , evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible .
he looked at the count , who still gazed at the spot where pierre s face had been before he sat down .
anna mikháylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son .
this lasted about two minutes , which to pierre seemed an hour .
suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count s face began to twitch .
the twitching increased , the handsome mouth was drawn to one side ( only now did pierre realize how near death his father was ) , and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct , hoarse sound .
anna mikháylovna looked attentively at the sick man s eyes , trying to guess what he wanted ; she pointed first to pierre , then to some drink , then named prince vasíli in an inquiring whisper , then pointed to the quilt .
the eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience .
he made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed .
wants to turn on the other side , whispered the servant , and got up to turn the count s heavy body toward the wall .
pierre rose to help him .
while the count was being turned over , one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward .
whether he noticed the look of terror with which pierre regarded that lifeless arm , or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain , at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm , at pierre s face , and again at the arm , and on his face a feeble , piteous smile appeared , quite out of keeping with his features , that seemed to deride his own helplessness .
at sight of this smile pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose , and tears dimmed his eyes .
the sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall .
he sighed .
he is dozing , said anna mikháylovna , observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching .
let us pierre went out .
there was now no one in the reception room except prince vasíli and the eldest princess , who were sitting under the portrait of catherine the great and talking eagerly .
as soon as they saw pierre and his companion they became silent , and pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered i can t bear the sight of that catiche has had tea served in the small drawing room , said prince vasíli to anna mikháylovna .
go and take something , my poor anna mikháylovna , or you will not hold to pierre he said nothing , merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder .
pierre went with anna mikháylovna into the small drawing room .
there is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious russian tea , lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room .
around the table all who were at count bezúkhov s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves .
pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables .
during balls given at the house pierre , who did not know how to dance , had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who , as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders , looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times .
now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles .
on one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder , and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there , not merrymaking , but somberly whispering , and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom .
pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to .
he looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left prince vasíli and the eldest princess .
pierre concluded that this also was essential , and after a short interval followed her .
anna mikháylovna was standing beside the princess , and they were both speaking in excited whispers .
permit me , princess , to know what is necessary and what is not necessary , said the younger of the two speakers , evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room .
but , my dear princess , answered anna mikháylovna blandly but impressively , blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing , won t this be too much for poor uncle at a moment when he needs repose ?
worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared prince vasíli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude , with one leg crossed high above the other .
his cheeks , which were so flabby that they looked heavier below , were twitching violently ; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying .
come , my dear anna mikháylovna , let catiche do as she pleases .
you know how fond the count is of i don t even know what is in this paper , said the younger of the two ladies , addressing prince vasíli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand .
all i know is that his real will is in his writing table , and this is a paper he has forgotten she tried to pass anna mikháylovna , but the latter sprang so as to bar her path .
i know , my dear , kind princess , said anna mikháylovna , seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily .
dear princess , i beg and implore you , have some pity on him !
je vous en conjure the princess did not reply .
their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible , but it was evident that if the princess did speak , her words would not be flattering to anna mikháylovna .
though the latter held on tenaciously , her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness .
pierre , my dear , come here .
i think he will not be out of place in a family consultation ; is it not so , prince ? why don t you speak , cousin ? suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled .
why do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere , making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man s room ?
intriguer ! she hissed viciously , and tugged with all her might at the portfolio .
but anna mikháylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio , and changed her grip .
prince vasíli rose .
oh ! said he with reproach and surprise , this is absurd !
come , let go i tell the princess let go .
and you too ! but anna mikháylovna did not obey him .
let go , i tell you !
i will take the responsibility .
i myself will go and ask him , i !
does that satisfy you ? but , prince , said anna mikháylovna , after such a solemn sacrament , allow him a moment s peace !
here , pierre , tell them your opinion , said she , turning to the young man who , having come quite close , was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity , and at the twitching cheeks of prince vasíli .
remember that you will answer for the consequences , said prince vasíli severely .
you don t know what you are vile woman ! shouted the princess , darting unexpectedly at anna mikháylovna and snatching the portfolio from her .
prince vasíli bent his head and spread out his hands .
at this moment that terrible door , which pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly , burst noisily open and banged against the wall , and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands .
what are you doing ! she cried vehemently .
he is dying and you leave me alone with him ! her sister dropped the portfolio .
anna mikháylovna , stooping , quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom .
the eldest princess and prince vasíli , recovering themselves , followed her .
a few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face , again biting her underlip .
at sight of pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred .
yes , now you may be glad ! said she ; this is what you have been waiting and bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room .
prince vasíli came next .
he staggered to the sofa on which pierre was sitting and dropped onto it , covering his face with his hand .
pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague .
ah , my friend ! said he , taking pierre by the elbow ; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness pierre had never observed in it before .
how often we sin , how much we deceive , and all for what ?
i am near sixty , dear friend
i too all will end in death , all !
death is awful and he burst into tears .
anna mikháylovna came out last .
she approached pierre with slow , quiet steps .
pierre ! she said .
pierre gave her an inquiring look .
she kissed the young man on his forehead , wetting him with her tears .
then after a pause she said he is no more pierre looked at her over his spectacles .
come , i will go with you .
try to weep , nothing gives such relief as she led him into the dark drawing room and pierre was glad no one could see his face .
anna mikháylovna left him , and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm .
in the morning anna mikháylovna said to pierre yes , my dear , this is a great loss for us all , not to speak of you .
but god will support you you are young , and are now , i hope , in command of an immense fortune .
the will has not yet been opened .
i know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head , but it imposes duties on you , and you must be a pierre was silent .
perhaps later on i may tell you , my dear boy , that if i had not been there , god only knows what would have happened !
you know , uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget borís .
but he had no time .
i hope , my dear friend , you will carry out your father s wish ? pierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at princess anna mikháylovna .
after her talk with pierre , anna mikháylovna returned to the rostóvs and went to bed .
on waking in the morning she told the rostóvs and all her acquaintances the details of count bezúkhov s death .
she said the count had died as she would herself wish to die , that his end was not only touching but edifying .
as to the last meeting between father and son , it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears , and did not know which had behaved better during those awful father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son , or pierre , whom it had been pitiful to see , so stricken was he with grief , though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father .
it is painful , but it does one good .
it uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son , said she .
of the behavior of the eldest princess and prince vasíli she spoke disapprovingly , but in whispers and as a great secret .
at bald hills , prince nicholas andréevich bolkónski s estate , the arrival of young prince andrew and his wife was daily expected , but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince s household .
general in chief prince nicholas andréevich ( nicknamed in society , the king of prussia ) ever since the emperor paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter , princess mary , and her companion , mademoiselle bourienne .
though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals , he still continued to live in the country , remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from moscow to bald hills , while he himself needed no one and nothing .
he used to say that there are only two sources of human and superstition , and only two and intelligence .
he himself undertook his daughter s education , and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty , and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied .
he was himself always occupied writing his memoirs , solving problems in higher mathematics , turning snuffboxes on a lathe , working in the garden , or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate .
as regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity , regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude .
he always came to table under precisely the same conditions , and not only at the same hour but at the same minute .
with those about him , from his daughter to his serfs , the prince was sharp and invariably exacting , so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused .
although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs , every high official appointed to the province in which the prince s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect , gardener , or princess mary did , till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour .
everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man , with powdered wig , small withered hands , and bushy gray eyebrows which , when he frowned , sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd , youthfully glittering eyes .
on the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive , princess mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting , crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer .
every morning she came in like that , and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well .
an old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper please walk through the door came the regular hum of a lathe .
the princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily .
she paused at the entrance .
the prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work .
the enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use .
the large table covered with books and plans , the tall bookcases with keys in the locks , the high desk for writing while standing up , on which lay an open exercise book , and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered indicated continuous , varied , and orderly activity .
the motion of the small foot shod in a tartar boot embroidered with silver , and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand , showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age .
after a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal , wiped his chisel , dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe , and , approaching the table , summoned his daughter .
he never gave his children a blessing , so he simply held out his bristly cheek ( as yet unshaven ) and , regarding her tenderly and attentively , said severely quite well ?
all right then , sit he took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot .
for tomorrow ! said he , quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail .
the princess bent over the exercise book on the table .
wait a bit , here s a letter for you , said the old man suddenly , taking a letter addressed in a woman s hand from a bag hanging above the table , onto which he threw it .
at the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess face .
she took it quickly and bent her head over it .
from héloïse ? asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound , yellowish teeth .
yes , it s from julie , replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile .
i ll let two more letters pass , but the third i ll read , said the prince sternly ; i m afraid you write much nonsense .
i ll read the third ! read this if you like , father , said the princess , blushing still more and holding out the letter .
the third , i said the third ! cried the prince abruptly , pushing the letter away , and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures .
well , madam , he began , stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat , so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco , which she had known so long .
now , madam , these triangles are equal ; please note that the angle the princess looked in a scared way at her father s eyes glittering close to her ; the red patches on her face came and went , and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father s further explanations , however clear they might be .
whether it was the teacher s fault or the pupil s , this same thing happened every day the princess eyes grew dim , she could not see and could not hear anything , but was only conscious of her stern father s withered face close to her , of his breath and the smell of him , and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace .
the old man was beside himself moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward , made efforts to control himself and not become vehement , but almost always did become vehement , scolded , and sometimes flung the exercise book away .
the princess gave a wrong answer .
well now , isn t she a fool ! shouted the prince , pushing the book aside and turning sharply away ; but rising immediately , he paced up and down , lightly touched his daughter s hair and sat down again .
he drew up his chair , and continued to explain .
this won t do , princess ; it won t do , said he , when princess mary , having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day s lesson , was about to leave mathematics are most important , madam !
i don t want to have you like our silly ladies .
get used to it and you ll like it , and he patted her cheek .
it will drive all the nonsense out of your she turned to go , but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk .
here is some sort of key to the mysteries that your héloïse has sent you .
religious !
i don t interfere with anyone s belief
i have looked at it .
take it .
well , now go .
he patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her .
princess mary went back to her room with the sad , scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain , sickly face yet plainer .
she sat down at her writing table , on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers .
the princess was as untidy as her father was tidy .
she put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter .
it was from her most intimate friend from childhood ; that same julie karágina who had been at the rostóvs party .
julie wrote in french dear and precious friend , how terrible and frightful a thing is separation !
though i tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you , and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds , my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me i can not overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted .
why are we not together as we were last summer , in your big study , on the blue sofa , the confidential sofa ?
why can not i now , as three months ago , draw fresh moral strength from your look , so gentle , calm , and penetrating , a look i loved so well and seem to see before me as i write ?
having read thus far , princess mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right .
it reflected a weak , ungraceful figure and thin face .
her eyes , always sad , now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass .
she flatters me , thought the princess , turning away and continuing to read .
but julie did not flatter her friend , the princess , deep and luminous ( it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light ) so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty .
but the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own look they had when she was not thinking of herself .
as with everyone , her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass .
she went on reading all moscow talks of nothing but war .
one of my two brothers is already abroad , the other is with the guards , who are starting on their march to the frontier .
our dear emperor has left petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war .
god grant that the corsican monster who is destroying the peace of europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the almighty , in his goodness , to give us as sovereign !
to say nothing of my brothers , this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart .
i mean young nicholas rostóv , who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army .
i will confess to you , dear mary , that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me .
this young man , of whom i spoke to you last summer , is so and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and , particularly , he is so frank and has so much heart .
he is so pure and poetic that my relations with him , transient as they were , have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart , which has already suffered so much .
someday i will tell you about our parting and all that was said then .
that is still too fresh .
ah , dear friend , you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows .
you are fortunate , for the latter are generally the stronger !
i know very well that count nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend , but this sweet friendship , this poetic and pure intimacy , were what my heart needed .
but enough of this !
the chief news , about which all moscow gossips , is the death of old count bezúkhov , and his inheritance .
fancy !
the three princesses have received very little , prince vasíli nothing , and it is monsieur pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate ; so that he is now count bezúkhov and possessor of the finest fortune in russia .
it is rumored that prince vasíli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to petersburg quite crestfallen .
i confess i understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance ; but i do know that since this young man , whom we all used to know as plain monsieur pierre , has become count bezúkhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in russia , i am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters , and of the young ladies themselves , toward him , though , between you and me , he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow .
as for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me ( most of whom i don t even know ) , the matchmaking chronicles of moscow now speak of me as the future countess bezúkhova .
but you will understand that i have no desire for the post .
à propos of marriages do you know that a while ago that universal auntie anna mikháylovna told me , under the seal of strict secrecy , of a plan of marriage for you .
it is neither more nor less than with prince vasíli s son anatole , whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distinguée , and it is on you that his relations choice has fallen .
i don t know what you will think of it , but i consider it my duty to let you know of it .
he is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace .
that is all i have been able to find out about him .
but enough of gossip .
i am at the end of my second sheet of paper , and mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the apráksins .
read the mystical book i am sending you ; it has an enormous success here .
though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp , it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul .
adieu !
give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to mademoiselle bourienne .
i embrace you as i love you .
.
let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife .
the princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed .
then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table .
she took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it .
this is the reply she wrote , also in french dear and precious friend , your letter of the has given me great delight .
so you still love me , my romantic julie ?
separation , of which you say so much that is bad , does not seem to have had its usual effect on you .
you complain of our separation .
what then should i say , if i dared complain , i who am deprived of all who are dear to me ?
ah , if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad .
why do you suppose that i should look severely on your affection for that young man ?
on such matters i am only severe with myself .
i understand such feelings in others , and if never having felt them i can not approve of them , neither do i condemn them .
only it seems to me that christian love , love of one s neighbor , love of one s enemy , is worthier , sweeter , and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself .
the news of count bezúkhov s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it .
he says the count was the last representative but one of the great century , and that it is his own turn now , but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible .
god preserve us from that terrible misfortune !
i can not agree with you about pierre , whom i knew as a child .
he always seemed to me to have an excellent heart , and that is the quality i value most in people .
as to his inheritance and the part played by prince vasíli , it is very sad for both .
ah , my dear friend , our divine saviour s words , that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of god , are terribly true .
i pity prince vasíli but am still more sorry for pierre .
so young , and burdened with such what temptations he will be exposed !
if i were asked what i desire most on earth , it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar .
a thousand thanks , dear friend , for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in moscow .
yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding can not grasp , it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit .
i never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination , giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to christian simplicity .
let us rather read the epistles and gospels .
let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain ; for how can we , miserable sinners that we are , know the terrible and holy secrets of providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the eternal ?
let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine saviour has left for our guidance here below .
let us try to conform to them and follow them , and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam , the better we shall please god , who rejects all knowledge that does not come from him ; and the less we seek to fathom what he has been pleased to conceal from us , the sooner will he vouchsafe its revelation to us through his divine spirit .
my father has not spoken to me of a suitor , but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from prince vasíli .
in regard to this project of marriage for me , i will tell you , dear sweet friend , that i look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform .
however painful it may be to me , should the almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me i shall try to perform them as faithfully as i can , without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom he may give me for husband .
i have had a letter from my brother , who announces his speedy arrival at bald hills with his wife .
this pleasure will be but a brief one , however , for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn , god knows how or why .
not only where you the heart of affairs and of the the talk all of war , even here amid fieldwork and the calm of townsfolk consider characteristic of the of war are heard and painfully felt .
my father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches , things of which i understand nothing ; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village i witnessed a heartrending scene
it was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army .
you should have seen the state of the mothers , wives , and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs .
it seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine saviour , who preached love and forgiveness of that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another .
adieu , dear and kind friend ; may our divine saviour and his most holy mother keep you in their holy and care !
ah , you are sending off a letter , princess ?
i have already dispatched mine .
i have written to my poor mother , said the smiling mademoiselle bourienne rapidly , in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r s .
she brought into princess mary s strenuous , mournful , and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere , careless , lighthearted , and .
princess , i must warn you , she added , lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure , and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement , the prince has been scolding michael ivánovich .
he is in a very bad humor , very morose .
be ah , dear friend , replied princess mary , i have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in .
i do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do the princess glanced at her watch and , seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord , went into the sitting room with a look of alarm .
between twelve and two o clock , as the day was mapped out , the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord .
the valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince , who was in his large study .
from the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult times a sonata by dussek .
just then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch .
prince andrew got out of the carriage , helped his little wife to alight , and let her pass into the house before him .
old tíkhon , wearing a wig , put his head out of the door of the antechamber , reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping , and hastily closed the door .
tíkhon knew that neither the son s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day .
prince andrew apparently knew this as well as tíkhon ; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father s habits had changed since he was at home last , and , having assured himself that they had not , he turned to his wife .
he will get up in twenty minutes .
let us go across to mary s room , he said .
the little princess had grown stouter during this time , but her eyes and her short , downy , smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever .
why , this is a palace ! she said to her husband , looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball .
let s come , quick , quick ! and with a glance round , she smiled at tíkhon , at her husband , and at the footman who accompanied them .
is that mary practicing ?
let s go quietly and take her by prince andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression .
you ve grown older , tíkhon , he said in passing to the old man , who kissed his hand .
before they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came , the pretty , frenchwoman , mademoiselle bourienne , rushed out apparently beside herself with delight .
ah !
what joy for the princess ! exclaimed she at last !
i must let her no , no , please not you are mademoiselle bourienne , said the little princess , kissing her .
i know you already through my s friendship for you .
she was not expecting us ? they went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the passage of the sonata .
prince andrew stopped and made a grimace , as if expecting something unpleasant .
the little princess entered the room .
the passage broke off in the middle , a cry was heard , then princess mary s heavy tread and the sound of kissing .
when prince andrew went in the two princesses , who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding , were in each other s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch .
mademoiselle bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart , with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh .
prince andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned , as lovers of music do when they hear a false note .
the two women let go of one another , and then , as if afraid of being too late , seized each other s hands , kissing them and pulling them away , and again began kissing each other on the face , and then to prince andrew s surprise both began to cry and kissed again .
mademoiselle bourienne also began to cry .
prince andrew evidently felt ill at ease , but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry , and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting .
ah !
my dear !
ah !
mary ! they suddenly exclaimed , and then laughed .
i dreamed last night you were not expecting us ? ah !
mary , you have got thinner ? and you have grown stouter ! i knew the princess at once , put in mademoiselle bourienne .
and i had no idea ! exclaimed princess mary .
ah , andrew , i did not see prince andrew and his sister , hand in hand , kissed one another , and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever .
princess mary had turned toward her brother , and through her tears the loving , warm , gentle look of her large luminous eyes , very beautiful at that moment , rested on prince andrew s face .
the little princess talked incessantly , her short , downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes .
she told of an accident they had had on the spásski hill which might have been serious for her in her condition , and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here ; and that andrew had quite changed , and that kitty odýntsova had married an old man , and that there was a suitor for mary , a real one , but that they would talk of that later .
princess mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness .
it was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her s words .
in the midst of a description of the last petersburg fete she addressed her brother so you are really going to the war , andrew ? she said sighing .
lise sighed too .
yes , and even tomorrow , replied her brother .
he is leaving me here , god knows why , when he might have had promotion princess mary did not listen to the end , but continuing her train of thought turned to her with a tender glance at her figure .
is it certain ? she said .
the face of the little princess changed .
she sighed and said yes , quite certain .
ah !
it is very dreadful her lip descended .
she brought her face close to her s and unexpectedly again began to cry .
she needs rest , said prince andrew with a frown .
don t you , lise ?
take her to your room and i ll go to father .
how is he ?
just the same ? yes , just the same .
though i don t know what your opinion will be , answered the princess joyfully .
and are the hours the same ?
and the walks in the avenues ?
and the lathe ? asked prince andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that , in spite of all his love and respect for his father , he was aware of his weaknesses .
the hours are the same , and the lathe , and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons , said princess mary gleefully , as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life .
when the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up , tíkhon came to call the young prince to his father .
the old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son s arrival he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner .
the old prince always dressed in style , wearing an antique coat and powdered hair ; and when prince andrew entered his father s dressing room ( not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms , but with the animated face with which he talked to pierre ) , the old man was sitting on a large chair , wrapped in a powdering mantle , entrusting his head to tíkhon .
ah !
here s the warrior !
wants to vanquish buonaparte ? said the old man , shaking his powdered head as much as the tail , which tíkhon was holding fast to plait , would allow .
you at least must tackle him properly , or else if he goes on like this he ll soon have us , too , for his subjects !
how are you ? and he held out his cheek .
the old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner .
( he used to say that a nap after dinner was dinner , ) he cast happy , sidelong glances at his son from under his thick , bushy eyebrows .
prince andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him .
he made no reply on his father s favorite fun of the military men of the day , and more particularly of bonaparte .
yes , father , i have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant , said prince andrew , following every movement of his father s face with an eager and respectful look .
how is your health ? only fools and rakes fall ill , my boy .
you know me i am busy from morning till night and abstemious , so of course i am thank god , said his son smiling .
god has nothing to do with it !
well , go on , he continued , returning to his hobby ; tell me how the germans have taught you to fight bonaparte by this new science you call prince andrew smiled .
give me time to collect my wits , father , said he , with a smile that showed that his father s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him .
why , i have not yet had time to settle down ! nonsense , nonsense ! cried the old man , shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited , and grasping his by the hand .
the house for your wife is ready .
princess mary will take her there and show her over , and they ll talk nineteen to the dozen .
that s their woman s way !
i am glad to have her .
sit down and talk .
about mikhelson s army i s too a simultaneous expedition
but what s the southern army to do ?
prussia is neutral
i know that .
what about austria ? said he , rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by tíkhon , who ran after him , handing him different articles of clothing .
what of sweden ?
how will they cross pomerania ? prince andrew , seeing that his father insisted , first reluctantly , but gradually with more and more animation , and from habit changing unconsciously from russian to french as he went explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign .
he explained how an army , ninety thousand strong , was to threaten prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war ; how part of that army was to join some swedish forces at stralsund ; how two hundred and twenty thousand austrians , with a hundred thousand russians , were to operate in italy and on the rhine ; how fifty thousand russians and as many english were to land at naples , and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the french from different sides .
the old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation , but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about , and three times unexpectedly interrupted .
once he stopped it by shouting the white one , the white one ! this meant that tíkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted .
another time he interrupted , saying and will she soon be confined ? and shaking his head reproachfully said that s bad !
go on , go the third interruption came when prince andrew was finishing his description .
the old man began to sing , in the cracked voice of old age malbrook s en guerre .
dieu sait quand marlborough is going to the wars ; god knows when he ll his son only smiled .
i don t say it s a plan i approve of , said the son ; i am only telling you what it is .
napoleon has also formed his plan by now , not worse than this well , you ve told me nothing new , and the old man repeated , meditatively and rapidly dieu sait quand reviendra .
go to the dining at the appointed hour the prince , powdered and shaven , entered the dining room where his , princess mary , and mademoiselle bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect , who by a strange caprice of his employer s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor .
the prince , who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table , had unexpectedly selected michael ivánovich ( who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief ) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals , and had more than once impressed on his daughter that michael ivánovich was not a whit worse than you or at dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn michael ivánovich more often than to anyone else .
in the dining room , which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty , the members of the household and the behind each waiting for the prince to enter .
the head butler , napkin on arm , was scanning the setting of the table , making signs to the footmen , and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter .
prince andrew was looking at a large gilt frame , new to him , containing the genealogical tree of the princes bolkónski , opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait ( evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate ) of a ruling prince , in a alleged descendant of rúrik and ancestor of the bolkónskis .
prince andrew , looking again at that genealogical tree , shook his head , laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing .
how thoroughly like him that is ! he said to princess mary , who had come up to him .
princess mary looked at her brother in surprise .
she did not understand what he was laughing at .
everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question .
everyone has his achilles heel , continued prince andrew .
fancy , with his powerful mind , indulging in such nonsense ! princess mary could not understand the boldness of her brother s criticism and was about to reply , when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study .
the prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont , as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house .
at that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room .
the prince stood still ; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick , bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess .
she felt , as courtiers do when the tsar enters , the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him .
he stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck .
i m glad , glad , to see you , he said , looking attentively into her eyes , and then quickly went to his place and sat down .
sit down , sit down !
sit down , michael ivánovich ! he indicated a place beside him to his .
a footman moved the chair for her .
ho , ho ! said the old man , casting his eyes on her rounded figure .
you ve been in a hurry .
that s bad ! he laughed in his usual dry , cold , unpleasant way , with his lips only and not with his eyes .
you must walk , walk as much as possible , as much as possible , he said .
the little princess did not , or did not wish to , hear his words .
she was silent and seemed confused .
the prince asked her about her father , and she began to smile and talk .
he asked about mutual acquaintances , and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip .
countess apráksina , poor thing , has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out , she said , growing more and more lively .
as she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly , and suddenly , as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her , he turned away and addressed michael ivánovich .
well , michael ivánovich , our bonaparte will be having a bad time of it .
prince andrew ( he always spoke thus of his son ) has been telling me what forces are being collected against him !
while you and i never thought much of michael ivánovich did not at all know when you and i had said such things about bonaparte , but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince s favorite topic , he looked inquiringly at the young prince , wondering what would follow .
he is a great tactician ! said the prince to his son , pointing to the architect .
and the conversation again turned on the war , on bonaparte , and the generals and statesmen of the day .
the old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the a b c of war or of politics , and that bonaparte was an insignificant little frenchy , successful only because there were no longer any potëmkins or suvórovs left to oppose him ; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in europe and no real war , but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing , pretending to do something real .
prince andrew gaily bore with his father s ridicule of the new men , and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure .
the past always seems good , said he , but did not suvórov himself fall into a trap moreau set him , and from which he did not know how to escape ? who told you that ?
who ? cried the prince .
suvórov ! and he jerked away his plate , which tíkhon briskly caught .
suvórov !
consider , prince andrew .
two frederick and suvórov ; moreau !
moreau would have been a prisoner if suvórov had had a free hand ; but he had the on his hands .
it would have puzzled the devil himself !
when you get there you ll find out what those are !
suvórov couldn t manage them so what chance has michael kutúzov ?
no , my dear boy , he continued , you and your generals won t get on against buonaparte ; you ll have to call in the french , so that birds of a feather may fight together .
the german , pahlen , has been sent to new york in america , to fetch the frenchman , moreau , he said , alluding to the invitation made that year to moreau to enter the russian service
wonderful !
were the potëmkins , suvórovs , and orlóvs germans ?
no , lad , either you fellows have all lost your wits , or i have outlived mine .
may god help you , but we ll see what will happen .
buonaparte has become a great commander among them !
hm ! i don t at all say that all the plans are good , said prince andrew , i am only surprised at your opinion of bonaparte .
you may laugh as much as you like , but all the same bonaparte is a great general ! michael ivánovich ! cried the old prince to the architect who , busy with his roast meat , hoped he had been forgotten didn t i tell you buonaparte was a great tactician ?
here , he says the same to be sure , your excellency , replied the architect .
the prince again laughed his frigid laugh .
buonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth .
he has got splendid soldiers .
besides he began by attacking germans .
and only idlers have failed to beat the germans .
since the world began everybody has beaten the germans .
they beat no one another .
he made his reputation fighting and the prince began explaining all the blunders which , according to him , bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics .
his son made no rejoinder , but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion .
he listened , refraining from a reply , and involuntarily wondered how this old man , living alone in the country for so many years , could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent european military and political events .
you think i m an old man and don t understand the present state of affairs ? concluded his father .
but it troubles me .
i don t sleep at night .
come now , where has this great commander of yours shown his skill ? he concluded .
that would take too long to tell , answered the son .
well , then go off to your buonaparte !
mademoiselle bourienne , here s another admirer of that emperor of yours , he exclaimed in excellent french .
you know , prince , i am not a bonapartist ! dieu sait quand hummed the prince out of tune and , with a laugh still more so , he quitted the table .
the little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent , glancing with a frightened look now at her and now at princess mary .
when they left the table she took her s arm and drew her into another room .
what a clever man your father is , said she ; perhaps that is why i am afraid of oh , he is so kind ! answered princess mary .
prince andrew was to leave next evening .
the old prince , not altering his routine , retired as usual after dinner .
the little princess was in her s room .
prince andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him .
after inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in , he ordered the horses to be harnessed .
only those things he always kept with him remained in his room ; a small box , a large canteen fitted with silver plate , two turkish pistols and a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of ochákov .
all these traveling effects of prince andrew s were in very good order new , clean , and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes .
when starting on a journey or changing their mode of life , men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind .
at such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future .
prince andrew s face looked very thoughtful and tender .
with his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room , looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head .
did he fear going to the war , or was he sad at leaving his wife ? both , but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood , for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands , stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box , and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression .
it was the heavy tread of princess mary that he heard .
i hear you have given orders to harness , she cried , panting ( she had apparently been running ) , and i did so wish to have another talk with you alone !
god knows how long we may again be parted .
you are not angry with me for coming ?
you have changed so , andrúsha , she added , as if to explain such a question .
she smiled as she uttered his pet name , it was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood .
and where is lise ? he asked , answering her question only by a smile .
she was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room .
oh , andrew !
what a treasure of a wife you have , said she , sitting down on the sofa , facing her brother .
she is quite a child such a dear , merry child .
i have grown so fond of prince andrew was silent , but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face .
one must be indulgent to little weaknesses ; who is free from them , andrew ?
don t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society , and so her position now is not a rosy one .
we should enter into everyone s situation .
tout comprendre , c est tout pardonner .
think what it must be for her , poor thing , after what she has been used to , to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country , in her condition !
it s very to understand all is to forgive all .
prince andrew smiled as he looked at his sister , as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand .
you live in the country and don t think the life terrible , he replied .
i that s different .
why speak of me ?
i don t want any other life , and can t , for i know no other .
but think , andrew for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life , all papa is always busy , and i well , you know what poor resources i have for entertaining a woman used to the best society .
there is only mademoiselle bourienne i don t like your mademoiselle bourienne at all , said prince andrew .
no ?
she is very nice and kind and , above all , she s much to be pitied .
she has no one , no one .
to tell the truth , i don t need her , and she s even in my way .
you know i always was a savage , and now am even more so .
i like being alone father likes her very much .
she and michael ivánovich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind , because he has been a benefactor to them both .
as sterne says we don t love people so much for the good they have done us , as for the good we have done father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father .
she is very , and my father likes her way of reading .
she reads to him in the evenings and reads to be quite frank , mary , i expect father s character sometimes makes things trying for you , doesn t it ? prince andrew asked suddenly .
princess mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question .
for me ?
for me ?
trying for me ! said she .
he always was rather harsh ; and now i should think he s getting very trying , said prince andrew , apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister .
you are good in every way , andrew , but you have a kind of intellectual pride , said the princess , following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the and that s a great sin .
how can one judge father ?
but even if one might , what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke ?
and i am so contented and happy with him .
i only wish you were all as happy as i her brother shook his head incredulously .
the only thing that is hard for me
i will tell you the truth , andrew is father s way of treating religious subjects .
i don t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day , and can go so far astray .
that is the only thing that makes me unhappy .
but even in this i can see lately a shade of improvement .
his satire has been less bitter of late , and there was a monk he received and had a long talk ah !
my dear , i am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder , said prince andrew banteringly yet tenderly .
ah !
mon ami , i only pray , and hope that god will hear me .
andrew she said timidly after a moment s silence , i have a great favor to ask of what is it , dear ? that you will not refuse !
it will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you , but it will comfort me .
promise , andrúsha ! said she , putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it , as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted .
she looked timidly at her brother .
even if it were a great deal of trouble answered prince andrew , as if guessing what it was about .
think what you please !
i know you are just like father .
think as you please , but do this for my sake !
please do !
father s father , our grandfather , wore it in all his ( she still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule . )
so you promise ? of course .
what is it ? andrew , i bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off .
do you promise ? if it does not weigh a hundredweight and won t break my neck to please you said prince andrew .
but immediately , noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister s face , he repented and added i am glad ; really , dear , i am very against your will he will save and have mercy on you and bring you to himself , for in him alone is truth and peace , said she in a voice trembling with emotion , solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small , oval , antique , icon of the saviour in a gold setting , on a finely wrought silver chain .
she crossed herself , kissed the icon , and handed it to andrew .
please , andrew , for my sake ! rays of gentle light shone from her large , timid eyes .
those eyes lit up the whole of her thin , sickly face and made it beautiful .
her brother would have taken the icon , but she stopped him .
andrew understood , crossed himself and kissed the icon .
there was a look of tenderness , for he was touched , but also a gleam of irony on his face .
thank you , my she kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa .
they were silent for a while .
as i was saying to you , andrew , be kind and generous as you always used to be .
don t judge lise harshly , she began .
she is so sweet , so , and her position now is a very hard i do not think i have complained of my wife to you , másha , or blamed her .
why do you say all this to me ? red patches appeared on princess mary s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty .
i have said nothing to you , but you have already been talked to .
and i am sorry for that , he went on .
the patches grew deeper on her forehead , neck , and cheeks .
she tried to say something but could not .
her brother had guessed right the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement , and how she dreaded it , and had complained of her fate , her , and her husband .
after crying she had fallen asleep .
prince andrew felt sorry for his sister .
know this , másha i can t reproach , have not reproached , and never shall reproach my wife with anything , and i can not reproach myself with anything in regard to her ; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances i may be placed .
but if you want to know the truth if you want to know whether i am happy ?
no !
is she happy ?
no !
but why this is so i don t know as he said this he rose , went to his sister , and , stooping , kissed her forehead .
his fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful , kindly , and unaccustomed brightness , but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway .
let us go to her , i must say .
and wake and i ll come in a moment .
petrúshka ! he called to his valet come here , take these away .
put this on the seat and this to the princess mary rose and moved to the door , then stopped and said andrew , if you had faith you would have turned to god and asked him to give you the love you do not feel , and your prayer would have been well , maybe ! said prince andrew .
go , másha ; i ll come on the way to his sister s room , in the passage which connected one wing with the other , prince andrew met mademoiselle bourienne smiling sweetly .
it was the third time that day that , with an ecstatic and artless smile , she had met him in secluded passages .
oh !
i thought you were in your room , she said , for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes .
prince andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face .
he said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair , without looking at her eyes , with such contempt that the frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word .
when he reached his sister s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice , hurrying one word after another , came through the open door .
she was speaking as usual in french , and as if after long she wished to make up for lost time .
no , but imagine the old countess zúbova , with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth , as if she were trying to cheat old age ha , ha , ha !
mary ! this very sentence about countess zúbova and this same laugh prince andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times .
he entered the room softly .
the little princess , plump and rosy , was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands , talking incessantly , repeating petersburg reminiscences and even phrases .
prince andrew came up , stroked her hair , and asked if she felt rested after their journey .
she answered him and continued her chatter .
the coach with six horses was waiting at the porch .
it was an autumn night , so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole .
servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch .
the immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows .
the domestic serfs were crowding in the hall , waiting to bid to the young prince .
the members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall michael ivánovich , mademoiselle bourienne , princess mary , and the little princess .
prince andrew had been called to his father s study as the latter wished to say to him alone .
all were waiting for them to come out .
when prince andrew entered the study the old man in his spectacles and white dressing gown , in which he received no one but his son , sat at the table writing .
he glanced round .
going ? and he went on writing .
i ve come to say kiss me here , and he touched his cheek thanks , thanks ! what do you thank me for ? for not and not hanging to a woman s apron strings .
the service before everything .
thanks , thanks ! and he went on writing , so that his quill spluttered and squeaked .
if you have anything to say , say it .
these two things can be done together , he added .
about my wife
i am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands why talk nonsense ?
say what you when her confinement is due , send to moscow for an accoucheur let him be here the old prince stopped writing and , as if not understanding , fixed his stern eyes on his son .
i know that no one can help if nature does not do her work , said prince andrew , evidently confused .
i know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong , but it is her fancy and mine .
they have been telling her things .
she has had a dream and is hm hm muttered the old prince to himself , finishing what he was writing .
i ll do he signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh .
it s a bad business , eh ? what is bad , father ? the wife ! said the old prince , briefly and significantly .
i don t understand ! said prince andrew .
no , it can t be helped , lad , said the prince .
they re all like that ; one can t unmarry .
don t be afraid ; i won t tell anyone , but you know it he seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers , shook it , looked straight into his son s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him , and again laughed his frigid laugh .
the son sighed , thus admitting that his father had understood him .
the old man continued to fold and seal his letter , snatching up and throwing down the wax , the seal , and the paper , with his accustomed rapidity .
what s to be done ?
she s pretty !
i will do everything .
make your mind easy , said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter .
andrew did not speak ; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him .
the old man got up and gave the letter to his son .
listen ! said he ; don t worry about your wife what can be done shall be .
now listen !
give this letter to michael ilariónovich .
i have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant a bad position !
tell him i remember and like him .
write and tell me how he receives you .
if he is all him .
nicholas bolkónski s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor .
now come kutúzov .
he spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words , but his son was accustomed to understand him .
he led him to the desk , raised the lid , drew out a drawer , and took out an exercise book filled with his bold , tall , close handwriting .
i shall probably die before you .
so remember , these are my memoirs ; hand them to the emperor after my death .
now here is a lombard bond and a letter ; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of suvórov s wars .
send it to the academy .
here are some jottings for you to read when i am gone .
you will find them andrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet .
he felt that he must not say it .
i will do it all , father , he said .
well , now , ! he gave his son his hand to kiss , and embraced him .
remember this , prince andrew , if they kill you it will hurt me , your old father he paused unexpectedly , and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked but if i hear that you have not behaved like a son of nicholas bolkónski , i shall be ashamed ! you need not have said that to me , father , said the son with a smile .
the old man was silent .
i also wanted to ask you , continued prince andrew , if i m killed and if i have a son , do not let him be taken away from i said yesterday let him grow up with you not let the wife have him ? said the old man , and laughed .
they stood silent , facing one another .
the old man s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son s .
something twitched in the lower part of the old prince s face .
we ve said .
go ! he suddenly shouted in a loud , angry voice , opening his door .
what is it ?
what ? asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door prince andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown , spectacled and wigless , shouting in an angry voice .
prince andrew sighed and made no reply .
well ! he said , turning to his wife .
and this well ! sounded coldly ironic , as if he were saying now go through your andrew , already ! said the little princess , turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband .
he embraced her .
she screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder .
he cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on , looked into her face , and carefully placed her in an easy chair .
adieu , mary , said he gently to his sister , taking her by the hand and kissing her , and then he left the room with rapid steps .
the little princess lay in the armchair , mademoiselle bourienne chafing her temples .
princess mary , supporting her , still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which prince andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction .
from the study , like pistol shots , came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose .
hardly had prince andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out .
gone ?
that s all right ! said he ; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess , he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door .
in october , , a russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the archduchy of austria , and yet other regiments freshly arriving from russia were settling near the fortress of braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered .
braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief , kutúzov .
on october , , one of the infantry regiments that had just reached braunau had halted half a mile from the town , waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief .
despite the appearance of the locality and gardens , stone fences , tiled roofs , and hills in the despite the fact that the inhabitants ( who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers ) were not russians , the regiment had just the appearance of any russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of russia .
on the evening of the last day s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march .
though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander , and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not , it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order , on the principle that it is always better to bow too low than not bow low so the soldiers , after a march , were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes , while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned , and by morning the of the straggling , disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day a array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty , had every button and every strap in place , and shone with cleanliness .
and not only externally was all in order , but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt , and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles , awl , soap , and all , as the soldiers say .
there was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease .
it was the state of the soldiers boots .
more than half the men s boots were in holes .
but this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander , for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the austrian commissariat , and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles .
the commander of the regiment was an elderly , choleric , stout , and general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers , and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders .
he had on a uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders .
he had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life .
he walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up , slightly arching his back .
it was plain that the commander admired his regiment , rejoiced in it , and that his whole mind was engrossed by it , yet his strut seemed to indicate that , besides military matters , social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts .
well , michael mítrich , sir ? he said , addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward ( it was plain that they both felt happy ) .
we had our hands full last night .
however , i think the regiment is not a bad one , eh ? the battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed .
it would not be turned off the field even on the tsarítsin what ? asked the commander .
at that moment , on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted , two men appeared on horse back .
they were an followed by a cossack .
the was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before , namely , that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march in their greatcoats , and packs , and without any preparation whatever .
a member of the hofkriegsrath from vienna had come to kutúzov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the archduke ferdinand and mack , and kutúzov , not considering this junction advisable , meant , among other arguments in support of his view , to show the austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from russia .
with this object he intended to meet the regiment ; so the worse the condition it was in , the better pleased the commander in chief would be .
though the did not know these circumstances , he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order , and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied .
on hearing this the regimental commander hung his head , silently shrugged his shoulders , and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture .
a fine mess we ve made of it ! he remarked .
there now !
didn t i tell you , michael mítrich , that if it was said on the march it meant in greatcoats ? said he reproachfully to the battalion commander .
oh , my god ! he added , stepping resolutely forward .
company commanders ! he shouted in a voice accustomed to command .
sergeants major !
how soon will he be here ? he asked the with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to .
in an hour s time , i should shall we have time to change clothes ? i don t know , general the regimental commander , going up to the line himself , ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats .
the company commanders ran off to their companies , the sergeants major began bustling ( the greatcoats were not in very good condition ) , and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices .
on all sides soldiers were running to and fro , throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads , unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms .
in half an hour all was again in order , only the squares had become gray instead of black .
the regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance .
whatever is this ?
this ! he shouted and stood still .
commander of the third company ! commander of the third company wanted by the general !
commander to the general third company to the the words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer .
when the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of the general to the third company , the missing officer appeared from behind his company and , though he was a man and not in the habit of running , trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general .
the captain s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned .
spots appeared on his nose , the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance , and his mouth twitched nervously .
the general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting , slackening his pace as he approached .
you will soon be dressing your men in petticoats !
what is this ? shouted the regimental commander , thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth , which contrasted with the others .
what have you been after ?
the commander in chief is expected and you leave your place ?
eh ?
i ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade eh ? the commander of the company , with his eyes fixed on his superior , pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap , as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation .
well , why don t you speak ?
whom have you got there dressed up as a hungarian ? said the commander with an austere gibe .
your excellency well , your excellency , what ?
your excellency !
but what about your excellency ?
nobody your excellency , it s the officer dólokhov , who has been reduced to the ranks , said the captain softly .
well ?
has he been degraded into a field marshal , or into a soldier ?
if a soldier , he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the your excellency , you gave him leave yourself , on the gave him leave ?
leave ?
that s just like you young men , said the regimental commander cooling down a little .
leave indeed one says a word to you and you what ? he added with renewed irritation , i beg you to dress your men and the commander , turning to look at the adjutant , directed his jerky steps down the line .
he was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath .
having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge , at another because his line was not straight , he reached the third company .
are you standing ?
where s your leg ?
your leg ? shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice , while there were still five men between him and dólokhov with his uniform .
dólokhov slowly straightened his bent knee , looking straight with his clear , insolent eyes in the general s face .
why a blue coat ?
off with it
sergeant major !
change his coat the ras he did not finish .
general , i must obey orders , but i am not bound to endure dólokhov hurriedly interrupted .
no talking in the ranks !
no talking , no talking ! not bound to endure insults , dólokhov concluded in loud , ringing tones .
the eyes of the general and the soldier met .
the general became silent , angrily pulling down his tight scarf .
i request you to have the goodness to change your coat , he said as he turned away .
he s coming ! shouted the signaler at that moment .
the regimental commander , flushing , ran to his horse , seized the stirrup with trembling hands , threw his body across the saddle , righted himself , drew his saber , and with a happy and resolute countenance , opening his mouth awry , prepared to shout .
the regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless .
! shouted the regimental commander in a voice which expressed joy for himself , severity for the regiment , and welcome for the approaching chief .
along the broad country road , edged on both sides by trees , came a high , light blue viennese calèche , slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot .
behind the calèche galloped the suite and a convoy of croats .
beside kutúzov sat an austrian general , in a white uniform that looked strange among the russian black ones .
the calèche stopped in front of the regiment .
kutúzov and the austrian general were talking in low voices and kutúzov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist .
the word of command rang out , and again the regiment quivered , as with a jingling sound it presented arms .
then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard .
the regiment roared , health to your ex len len lency ! and again all became silent .
at first kutúzov stood still while the regiment moved ; then he and the general in white , accompanied by the suite , walked between the ranks .
from the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes , drawing himself up obsequiously , and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals , bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements , and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief , it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander .
thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment , in comparison with others that had reached braunau at the same time , was in splendid condition .
there were only sick and stragglers .
everything was in good order except the boots .
kutúzov walked through the ranks , sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the turkish war , sometimes also to the soldiers .
looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly , pointing them out to the austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone , but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was .
the regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion , fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief s regarding the regiment .
behind kutúzov , at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard , followed some twenty men of his suite .
these gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed .
nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant .
this was prince bolkónski .
beside him was his comrade nesvítski , a tall staff officer , extremely stout , with a kindly , smiling , handsome face and moist eyes .
nesvítski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him .
this hussar , with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes , watched the regimental commander s back and mimicked his every movement .
each time the commander started and bent forward , the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner .
nesvítski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag .
kutúzov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief .
on reaching the third company he suddenly stopped .
his suite , not having expected this , involuntarily came closer to him .
ah , timókhin ! said he , recognizing the captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat .
one would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than timókhin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander , but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him , and so kutúzov , who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good , quickly turned away , a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face .
another ismail comrade , said he .
a brave officer !
are you satisfied with him ? he asked the regimental commander .
and the that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking , moved forward , and answered highly satisfied , your excellency ! we all have our weaknesses , said kutúzov smiling and walking away from him .
he used to have a predilection for the regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer .
the hussar at that moment noticed the face of the captain and his stomach , and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that nesvítski could not help laughing .
kutúzov turned round .
the officer evidently had complete control of his face , and while kutúzov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious , deferential , and innocent expression .
the third company was the last , and kutúzov pondered , apparently trying to recollect something .
prince andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in french you told me to remind you of the officer dólokhov , reduced to the ranks in this where is dólokhov ? asked kutúzov .
dólokhov , who had already changed into a soldier s gray greatcoat , did not wait to be called .
the shapely figure of the soldier , with his clear blue eyes , stepped forward from the ranks , went up to the commander in chief , and presented arms .
have you a complaint to make ? kutúzov asked with a slight frown .
this is dólokhov , said prince andrew .
ah ! said kutúzov .
i hope this will be a lesson to you .
do your duty .
the emperor is gracious , and i shan t forget you if you deserve the clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander , seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private .
one thing i ask of your excellency , dólokhov said in his firm , ringing , deliberate voice .
i ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to his majesty the emperor and to russia ! kutúzov turned away .
the same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from captain timókhin again flitted over his face .
he turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything dólokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him , that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted .
he turned away and went to the carriage .
the regiment broke up into companies , which went to their appointed quarters near braunau , where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches .
you won t bear me a grudge , prokhór ignátych ? said the regimental commander , overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to captain timókhin who was walking in front .
( the regimental commander s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight . )
it s in the emperor s service it can t be helped one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade
i am the first to apologize , you know me !
he was very pleased ! and he held out his hand to the captain .
don t mention it , general , as if i d be so bold ! replied the captain , his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at ismail .
and tell dólokhov that i won t forget may be quite easy .
and tell me , ve been meaning to is he behaving himself , and in general as far as the service goes he is quite punctilious , your excellency ; but his character said timókhin .
and what about his character ? asked the regimental commander .
it s different on different days , answered the captain .
one day he is sensible , well educated , and , and the next he s a wild beast
in poland , if you please , he nearly killed a oh , well , well ! remarked the regimental commander .
still , one must have pity on a young man in misfortune .
you know he has important connections well , then , you just i will , your excellency , said timókhin , showing by his smile that he understood his commander s wish .
well , of course , of course ! the regimental commander sought out dólokhov in the ranks and , reining in his horse , said to him after the next affair dólokhov looked round but did not say anything , nor did the mocking smile on his lips change .
well , that s all right , continued the regimental commander .
a cup of vodka for the men from me , he added so that the soldiers could hear .
i thank you all !
god be praised ! and he rode past that company and overtook the next one .
well , he s really a good fellow , one can serve under him , said timókhin to the subaltern beside him .
in a word , a hearty one said the subaltern , laughing ( the regimental commander was nicknamed king of hearts ) .
the cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers .
the company marched on gaily .
the soldiers voices could be heard on every side .
and they said kutúzov was blind of one eye ? and so he is !
quite blind ! no , friend , he is than you are .
boots and leg bands he noticed everything when he looked at my feet , friend well , thinks i and that other one with him , the austrian , looked as if he were smeared with white as flour !
i suppose they polish him up as they do the i say , fédeshon !
did he say when the battles are to begin ?
you were near him .
everybody said that buonaparte himself was at buonaparte himself !
just listen to the fool , what he doesn t know !
the prussians are up in arms now .
the austrians , you see , are putting them down .
when they ve been put down , the war with buonaparte will begin .
and he says buonaparte is in braunau !
shows you re a fool .
you d better listen more carefully ! what devils these quartermasters are !
see , the fifth company is turning into the village already they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our give me a biscuit , you devil ! and did you give me tobacco yesterday ?
that s just it , friend !
ah , well , never mind , here you they might call a halt here or we ll have to do another four miles without wasn t it fine when those germans gave us lifts !
you just sit still and are drawn and here , friend , the people are quite beggarly .
there they all seemed to be under the russian here they re all regular singers to the front came the captain s order .
and from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front .
a drummer , their leader , turned round facing the singers , and flourishing his arm , began a soldiers song , commencing with the words morning dawned , the sun was rising , and concluding on then , brothers , on to glory , led by father this song had been composed in the turkish campaign and now being sung in austria , the only change being that the words father kámenski were replaced by father having jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground , the lean , handsome soldier of sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes .
then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him , he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and , holding it there for some seconds , suddenly flung it down and began oh , my bower , oh , my bower ! oh , my bower new ! chimed in twenty voices , and the castanet player , in spite of the burden of his equipment , rushed out to the front and , walking backwards before the company , jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone .
the soldiers , swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously , marched with long steps .
behind the company the sound of wheels , the creaking of springs , and the tramp of horses hoofs were heard .
kutúzov and his suite were returning to the town .
the commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease , and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men .
in the second file from the right flank , beside which the carriage passed the company , a soldier involuntarily attracted notice .
it was dólokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company .
the hussar cornet of kutúzov s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander , fell back from the carriage and rode up to dólokhov .
hussar cornet zherkóv had at one time , in petersburg , belonged to the wild set led by dólokhov .
zherkóv had met dólokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him .
but now that kutúzov had spoken to the gentleman ranker , he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend .
my dear fellow , how are you ? said he through the singing , making his horse keep pace with the company .
how am i ? dólokhov answered coldly .
i am as you the lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which zherkóv spoke , and to the intentional coldness of dólokhov s reply .
and how do you get on with the officers ? inquired zherkóv .
all right .
they are good fellows .
and how have you wriggled onto the staff ? i was attached ; i m on both were silent .
she let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve , went the song , arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness .
their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song .
is it true that austrians have been beaten ? asked dólokhov .
the devil only knows !
they say i m glad , answered dólokhov briefly and clearly , as the song demanded .
i say , come round some evening and we ll have a game of faro ! said zherkóv .
why , have you too much money ? do i can t .
i ve sworn not to .
i won t drink and won t play till i get well , that s only till the first we shall they were again silent .
come if you need anything .
one can at least be of use on the staff dólokhov smiled .
don t trouble .
if i want anything , i won t ll take it ! well , never mind ; i only and i only good health it s a long , long way .
to my native land zherkóv touched his horse with the spurs ; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start , then settled down , galloped past the company , and overtook the carriage , still keeping time to the song .
on returning from the review , kutúzov took the austrian general into his private room and , calling his adjutant , asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival , and the letters that had come from the archduke ferdinand , who was in command of the advanced army .
prince andrew bolkónski came into the room with the required papers .
kutúzov and the austrian member of the hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out .
ah ! said kutúzov glancing at bolkónski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait , and he went on with the conversation in french .
all i can say , general , said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word .
it was evident that kutúzov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice .
all i can say , general , is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes , the will of his majesty the emperor francis would have been fulfilled long ago .
i should long ago have joined the archduke .
and believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful whom austria has so to lay down all this heavy responsibility .
but circumstances are sometimes too strong for us , and kutúzov smiled in a way that seemed to say , you are quite at liberty not to believe me and i don t even care whether you do or not , but you have no grounds for telling me so .
and that is the whole the austrian general looked dissatisfied , but had no option but to reply in the same tone .
on the contrary , he said , in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words , on the contrary , your excellency s participation in the common action is highly valued by his majesty ; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles , he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence .
kutúzov bowed with the same smile .
but that is my conviction , and judging by the last letter with which his highness the archduke ferdinand has honored me , i imagine that the austrian troops , under the direction of so skillful a leader as general mack , have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid , said kutúzov .
the general frowned .
though there was no definite news of an austrian defeat , there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat , and so kutúzov s suggestion of an austrian victory sounded much like irony .
but kutúzov went on blandly smiling with the same expression , which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so .
and , in fact , the last letter he had received from mack s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable .
give me that letter , said kutúzov turning to prince andrew .
please have a look at it kutúzov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the austrian general the following passage , in german , from the archduke ferdinand s letter we have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the lech .
also , as we are masters of ulm , we can not be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the danube , so that should the enemy not cross the lech , we can cross the danube , throw ourselves on his line of communications , recross the river lower down , and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally .
we shall therefore confidently await the moment when the imperial russian army will be fully equipped , and shall then , in conjunction with it , easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves .
kutúzov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively .
but you know the wise maxim your excellency , advising one to expect the worst , said the austrian general , evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business .
he involuntarily looked round at the .
excuse me , general , interrupted kutúzov , also turning to prince andrew .
look here , my dear fellow , get from kozlóvski all the reports from our scouts .
here are two letters from count nostitz and here is one from his highness the archduke ferdinand and here are these , he said , handing him several papers , make a neat memorandum in french out of all this , showing all the news we have had of the movements of the austrian army , and then give it to his prince andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what kutúzov would have liked to tell him .
he gathered up the papers and with a bow to both , stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room .
though not much time had passed since prince andrew had left russia , he had changed greatly during that period .
in the expression of his face , in his movements , in his walk , scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence .
he now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others , but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work .
his face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him , his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive .
kutúzov , whom he had overtaken in poland , had received him very kindly , promised not to forget him , distinguished him above the other adjutants , and had taken him to vienna and given him the more serious commissions .
from vienna kutúzov wrote to his old comrade , prince andrew s father .
your son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry , firmness , and expedition .
i consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me .
on kutúzov s staff , among his fellow officers and in the army generally , prince andrew had , as he had had in petersburg society , two quite opposite reputations .
some , a minority , acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else , expected great things of him , listened to him , admired , and imitated him , and with them prince andrew was natural and pleasant .
others , the majority , disliked him and considered him conceited , cold , and disagreeable .
but among these people prince andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him .
coming out of kutúzov s room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand prince andrew came up to his comrade , the on duty , kozlóvski , who was sitting at the window with a book .
well , prince ? asked kozlóvski .
i am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not and why is it ? prince andrew shrugged his shoulders .
any news from mack ? if it were true that he has been beaten , news would have probably , said prince andrew moving toward the outer door .
but at that instant a tall austrian general in a greatcoat , with the order of maria theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head , who had evidently just arrived , entered quickly , slamming the door .
prince andrew stopped short .
commander in chief kutúzov ? said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh german accent , looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door .
the commander in chief is engaged , said kozlóvski , going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door .
whom shall i announce ? the unknown general looked disdainfully down at kozlóvski , who was rather short , as if surprised that anyone should not know him .
the commander in chief is engaged , repeated kozlóvski calmly .
the general s face clouded , his lips quivered and trembled .
he took out a notebook , hurriedly scribbled something in pencil , tore out the leaf , gave it to kozlóvski , stepped quickly to the window , and threw himself into a chair , gazing at those in the room as if asking , why do they look at me ? then he lifted his head , stretched his neck as if he intended to say something , but immediately , with affected indifference , began to hum to himself , producing a queer sound which immediately broke off .
the door of the private room opened and kutúzov appeared in the doorway .
the general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger , and , making long , quick strides with his thin legs , went up to kutúzov .
vous voyez le malheureux mack , he uttered in a broken voice .
kutúzov s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments .
then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again , he bowed his head respectfully , closed his eyes , silently let mack enter his room before him , and closed the door himself behind him .
the report which had been circulated that the austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at ulm proved to be correct .
within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the russian troops , who had hitherto been inactive , would also soon have to meet the enemy .
prince andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war .
when he saw mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost , understood all the difficulties of the russian army s position , and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play .
involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant austria and that in a week s time he might , perhaps , see and take part in the first russian encounter with the french since suvórov met them .
he feared that bonaparte s genius might outweigh all the courage of the russian troops , and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced .
excited and irritated by these thoughts prince andrew went toward his room to write to his father , to whom he wrote every day .
in the corridor he met nesvítski , with whom he shared a room , and the wag zherkóv ; they were as usual laughing .
why are you so glum ? asked nesvítski noticing prince andrew s pale face and glittering eyes .
there s nothing to be gay about , answered bolkónski .
just as prince andrew met nesvítski and zherkóv , there came toward them from the other end of the corridor , strauch , an austrian general who on kutúzov s staff in charge of the provisioning of the russian army , and the member of the hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening .
there was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily , but zherkóv , pushing nesvítski aside with his arm , said in a breathless voice , they re coming !
they re coming !
stand aside , make way , please make way ! the generals were passing by , looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions .
on the face of the wag zherkóv there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress .
your excellency , said he in german , stepping forward and addressing the austrian general , i have the honor to congratulate he bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other , awkwardly , like a child at a dancing lesson .
the member of the hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but , seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile , could not but give him a moment s attention .
he screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening .
i have the honor to congratulate you .
general mack has arrived , quite well , only a little bruised just here , he added , pointing with a beaming smile to his head .
the general frowned , turned away , and went on .
gott , wie naiv ! said he angrily , after he had gone a few steps .
good god , what simplicity ! nesvítski with a laugh threw his arms round prince andrew , but bolkónski , turning still paler , pushed him away with an angry look and turned to zherkóv .
the nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of mack , the news of his defeat , and the thought of what lay before the russian army found vent in anger at zherkóv s untimely jest .
if you , sir , choose to make a buffoon of yourself , he said sharply , with a slight trembling of the lower jaw , i can t prevent your doing so ; but i warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence , i will teach you to behave nesvítski and zherkóv were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at bolkónski silently with eyes .
what s the matter ?
i only congratulated them , said zherkóv .
i am not jesting with you ; please be silent ! cried bolkónski , and taking nesvítski s arm he left zherkóv , who did not know what to say .
come , what s the matter , old fellow ? said nesvítski trying to soothe him .
what s the matter ? exclaimed prince andrew standing still in his excitement .
don t you understand that either we are officers serving our tsar and our country , rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause , or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master s business .
quarante mille hommes massacrés et l armée de nos alliés détruite , et vous trouvez là le mot pour rire , he said , as if strengthening his views by this french sentence .
c est bien pour un garçon de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami , mais pas pour vous , pas pour vous .
( ) only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way , he added in pronouncing the word with a french noticed that zherkóv could still hear him .
forty thousand men massacred and the army of our allies destroyed , and you find that a cause for jesting ! ( ) it is all very well for that fellow of whom you have made a friend , but not for you , not for he waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer , but he turned and went out of the corridor .
the pávlograd hussars were stationed two miles from braunau .
the squadron in which nicholas rostóv served as a cadet was quartered in the german village of salzeneck .
the best quarters in the village were assigned to denísov , the squadron commander , known throughout the whole cavalry division as váska denísov .
cadet rostóv , ever since he had overtaken the regiment in poland , had lived with the squadron commander .
on october , the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of mack s defeat , the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual .
denísov , who had been losing at cards all night , had not yet come home when rostóv rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition .
rostóv in his cadet uniform , with a jerk to his horse , rode up to the porch , swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement , stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse , and at last sprang down and called to his orderly .
ah , bondarénko , dear friend ! said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse .
walk him up and down , my dear fellow , he continued , with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy .
yes , your excellency , answered the ukrainian gaily , tossing his head .
mind , walk him up and down well ! another hussar also rushed toward the horse , but bondarénko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse s head .
it was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him .
rostóv patted the horse s neck and then his flank , and lingered for a moment .
splendid !
what a horse he will be ! he thought with a smile , and holding up his saber , his spurs jingling , he ran up the steps of the porch .
his landlord , who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap , pitchfork in hand , was clearing manure from the cowhouse , looked out , and his face immediately brightened on seeing rostóv .
schön gut morgen !
schön gut morgen ! he said winking with a merry smile , evidently pleased to greet the young man .
a very good morning !
a very good morning ! schon fleissig ? said rostóv with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face .
hoch oestreicher !
hoch russen !
kaiser alexander hoch ! ( ) said he , quoting words often repeated by the german landlord .
busy already ? ( ) hurrah for the austrians !
hurrah for the russians !
hurrah for emperor alexander ! the german laughed , came out of the cowshed , pulled off his cap , and waving it above his head cried und die ganze welt hoch ! and hurrah for the whole world ! rostóv waved his cap above his head like the german and cried laughing , und vivat die ganze welt ! though neither the german cleaning his cowshed nor rostóv back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing , they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love , wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection , and parted smiling , the german returning to his cowshed and rostóv going to the cottage he occupied with denísov .
what about your master ? he asked lavrúshka , denísov s orderly , whom all the regiment knew for a rogue .
hasn t been in since the evening .
must have been losing , answered lavrúshka .
i know by now , if he wins he comes back early to brag about it , but if he stays out till morning it means he s lost and will come back in a rage .
will you have coffee ? yes , bring ten minutes later lavrúshka brought the coffee .
he s coming ! said he .
now for trouble ! rostóv looked out of the window and saw denísov coming home .
denísov was a small man with a red face , sparkling black eyes , and black tousled mustache and hair .
he wore an unfastened cloak , wide breeches hanging down in creases , and a crumpled shako on the back of his head .
he came up to the porch gloomily , hanging his head .
lavwúska ! he shouted loudly and angrily , take it off , blockhead ! well , i am taking it off , replied lavrúshka s voice .
ah , you re up already , said denísov , entering the room .
long ago , answered rostóv , i have already been for the hay , and have seen fräulein weally !
and i ve been losing , bwother .
i lost yesterday like a damned fool ! cried denísov , not pronouncing his r s .
such ill luck !
such ill luck .
as soon as you left , it began and went on .
hullo there !
tea ! puckering up his face though smiling , and showing his short strong teeth , he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair .
and what devil made me go to that wat ? ( an officer nicknamed the rat ) he said , rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands .
just fancy , he didn t let me win a single cahd , not one he took the lighted pipe that was offered to him , gripped it in his fist , and tapped it on the floor , making the sparks fly , while he continued to shout .
he lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it ; gives the singles and snatches the doubles ! he scattered the burning tobacco , smashed the pipe , and threw it away .
then he remained silent for a while , and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering , black eyes at rostóv .
if at least we had some women here ; but there s nothing foh one to do but dwink .
if we could only get to fighting soon .
hullo , who s there ? he said , turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop , and a respectful cough .
the squadron quartermaster ! said lavrúshka .
denísov s face puckered still more .
wetched ! he muttered , throwing down a purse with some gold in it .
wostóv , deah fellow , just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow , he said , and went out to the quartermaster .
rostóv took the money and , mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles , began counting them .
ah !
telyánin !
how d ye do ?
they plucked me last night , came denísov s voice from the next room .
where ?
at bykov s , at the rat s
i knew it , replied a piping voice , and lieutenant telyánin , a small officer of the same squadron , entered the room .
rostóv thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him .
telyánin for some reason had been transferred from the guards just before this campaign .
he behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked ; rostóv especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man .
well , young cavalryman , how is my rook behaving ? he asked .
( rook was a young horse telyánin had sold to rostóv . )
the lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face ; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another .
i saw you riding this morning he added .
oh , he s all right , a good horse , answered rostóv , though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum .
he s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg , he added .
the hoof s cracked !
that s nothing .
i ll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to yes , please do , said rostóv .
i ll show you , i ll show you !
it s not a secret .
and it s a horse you ll thank me then i ll have it brought round , said rostóv wishing to avoid telyánin , and he went out to give the order .
in the passage denísov , with a pipe , was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him .
on seeing rostóv , denísov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where telyánin was sitting , he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust .
ugh !
i don t like that fellow , he said , regardless of the quartermaster s presence .
rostóv shrugged his shoulders as much as to say nor do i , but what s one to do ? and , having given his order , he returned to telyánin .
telyánin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which rostóv had left him , rubbing his small white hands .
well there certainly are disgusting people , thought rostóv as he entered .
have you told them to bring the horse ? asked telyánin , getting up and looking carelessly about him .
i let us go ourselves .
i only came round to ask denísov about yesterday s order .
have you got it , denísov ? not yet .
but where are you off to ? i want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse , said telyánin .
they went through the porch and into the stable .
the lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters .
when rostóv went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table .
denísov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper .
he looked gloomily in rostóv s face and said i am witing to he leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and , evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write , told rostóv the contents of his letter .
you see , my fwiend , he said , we sleep when we don t love .
we are childwen of the dust but one falls in love and one is a god , one is pua as on the fihst day of cweation who s that now ?
send him to the devil , i m busy ! he shouted to lavrúshka , who went up to him not in the least abashed .
who should it be ?
you yourself told him to come .
it s the quartermaster for the denísov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped .
wetched business , he muttered to himself .
how much is left in the puhse ? he asked , turning to rostóv .
seven new and three old oh , it s wetched !
well , what are you standing there for , you sca cwow ?
call the quahtehmasteh , he shouted to lavrúshka .
please , denísov , let me lend you some i have some , you know , said rostóv , blushing .
don t like bowwowing from my own fellows , i don t , growled denísov .
but if you won t accept money from me like a comrade , you will offend me .
really i have some , rostóv repeated .
no , i tell and denísov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow .
where have you put it , wostóv ? under the lower it s not denísov threw both pillows on the floor .
the purse was not there .
that s a wait , haven t you dropped it ? said rostóv , picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them .
he pulled off the quilt and shook it .
the purse was not there .
dear me , can i have forgotten ?
no , i remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure , said rostóv .
i put it just here .
where is it ? he asked , turning to lavrúshka .
i haven t been in the room .
it must be where you put but it isn t ? you re always like that ; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it .
feel in your no , if i hadn t thought of it being a treasure , said rostóv , but i remember putting it lavrúshka turned all the bedding over , looked under the bed and under the table , searched everywhere , and stood still in the middle of the room .
denísov silently watched lavrúshka s movements , and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found denísov glanced at rostóv .
wostóv , you ve not been playing schoolboy twicks rostóv felt denísov s gaze fixed on him , raised his eyes , and instantly dropped them again .
all the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes .
he could not draw breath .
and there hasn t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves .
it must be here somewhere , said lavrúshka .
now then , you devil s puppet , look alive and hunt for it ! shouted denísov , suddenly , turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture .
if the purse isn t found i ll flog you , i ll flog you rostóv , his eyes avoiding denísov , began buttoning his coat , buckled on his saber , and put on his cap .
i must have that purse , i tell you , shouted denísov , shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall .
denísov , let him alone , i know who has taken it , said rostóv , going toward the door without raising his eyes .
denísov paused , thought a moment , and , evidently understanding what rostóv hinted at , seized his arm .
nonsense ! he cried , and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords .
you are mad , i tell you .
i won t allow it .
the purse is here !
i ll flay this scoundwel alive , and it will be i know who has taken it , repeated rostóv in an unsteady voice , and went to the door .
and i tell you , don t you dahe to do it ! shouted denísov , rushing at the cadet to restrain him .
but rostóv pulled away his arm and , with as much anger as though denísov were his worst enemy , firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face .
do you understand what you re saying ? he said in a trembling voice .
there was no one else in the room except myself .
so that if it is not so , then he could not finish , and ran out of the room .
ah , may the devil take you and evewybody , were the last words rostóv heard .
rostóv went to telyánin s quarters .
the master is not in , he s gone to headquarters , said telyánin s orderly .
has something happened ? he added , surprised at the cadet s troubled face .
no , you ve only just missed him , said the orderly .
the headquarters were situated two miles away from salzeneck , and rostóv , without returning home , took a horse and rode there .
there was an inn in the village which the officers frequented .
rostóv rode up to it and saw telyánin s horse at the porch .
in the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine .
ah , you ve come here too , young man ! he said , smiling and raising his eyebrows .
yes , said rostóv as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word ; and he sat down at the nearest table .
both were silent .
there were two germans and a russian officer in the room .
no one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant .
when telyánin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and , drawing its rings aside with his small , white , fingers , drew out a gold imperial , and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter .
please be quick , he said .
the coin was a new one .
rostóv rose and went up to telyánin .
allow me to look at your purse , he said in a low , almost inaudible , voice .
with shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised , telyánin handed him the purse .
yes , it s a nice purse .
yes , yes , he said , growing suddenly pale , and added , look at it , young rostóv took the purse in his hand , examined it and the money in it , and looked at telyánin .
the lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry .
if we get to vienna i ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there s nowhere to spend it , said he .
well , let me have it , young man , i m rostóv did not speak .
and you ?
are you going to have lunch too ?
they feed you quite decently here , continued telyánin .
now then , let me have he stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse .
rostóv let go of it .
telyánin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches , with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open , as if to say , yes , yes , i am putting my purse in my pocket and that s quite simple and is no one else s well , young man ? he said with a sigh , and from under his lifted brows he glanced into rostóv s eyes .
some flash as of an electric spark shot from telyánin s eyes to rostóv s and back , and back again and again in an instant .
come here , said rostóv , catching hold of telyánin s arm and almost dragging him to the window .
that money is denísov s ; you took it he whispered just above telyánin s ear .
what ?
what ?
how dare you ?
what ? said telyánin .
but these words came like a piteous , despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon .
as soon as rostóv heard them , an enormous load of doubt fell from him .
he was glad , and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him , but the task he had begun had to be completed .
heaven only knows what the people here may imagine , muttered telyánin , taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room .
we must have an explanation i know it and shall prove it , said rostóv .
i every muscle of telyánin s pale , terrified face began to quiver , his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to rostóv s face , and his sobs were audible .
count !
don t ruin a young fellow here is this wretched money , take it he threw it on the table .
i have an old father and mother ! rostóv took the money , avoiding telyánin s eyes , and went out of the room without a word .
but at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps .
o god , he said with tears in his eyes , how could you do it ? count said telyánin drawing nearer to him .
don t touch me , said rostóv , drawing back .
if you need it , take the money , and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn .
that same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron s officers in denísov s quarters .
and i tell you , rostóv , that you must apologize to the colonel ! said a tall , staff captain , with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features , to rostóv who was crimson with excitement .
the staff captain , kírsten , had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission .
i will allow no one to call me a liar ! cried rostóv .
he told me i lied , and i told him he lied .
and there it rests .
he may keep me on duty every day , or may place me under arrest , but no one can make me apologize , because if he , as commander of this regiment , thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction , then you just wait a moment , my dear fellow , and listen , interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass , calmly stroking his long mustache .
you tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen i m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers .
perhaps i ought not to have spoken before them , but i am not a diplomatist .
that s why i joined the hussars , thinking that here one would not need finesse ; and he tells me that i am let him give me satisfaction that s all right .
no one thinks you a coward , but that s not the point .
ask denísov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander ? denísov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation , evidently with no wish to take part in it .
he answered the staff captain s question by a disapproving shake of his head .
you speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers , continued the staff captain , and bogdánich ( the colonel was called bogdánich ) shuts you he did not shut me up , he said i was telling an well , have it so , and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must not on any account ! exclaimed rostóv .
i did not expect this of you , said the staff captain seriously and severely .
you don t wish to apologize , but , man , it s not only to him but to the whole of re to blame all round .
the case is this you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice ; but no , you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers .
now what was the colonel to do ?
have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment ?
disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel ?
is that how you look at it ?
we don t see it like that .
and bogdánich was a brick he told you you were saying what was not true .
it s not pleasant , but what s to be done , my dear fellow ?
you landed yourself in it .
and now , when one wants to smooth the thing over , some conceit prevents your apologizing , and you wish to make the whole affair public .
you are offended at being put on duty a bit , but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer ?
whatever bogdánich may be , anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel !
you re quick at taking offense , but you don t mind disgracing the whole regiment ! the staff captain s voice began to tremble .
you have been in the regiment next to no time , my lad , you re here today and tomorrow you ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said there are thieves among the pávlograd officers ! but it s not all the same to us !
am i not right , denísov ?
it s not the same ! denísov remained silent and did not move , but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at rostóv .
you value your own pride and don t wish to apologize , continued the staff captain , but we old fellows , who have grown up in and , god willing , are going to die in the regiment , we prize the honor of the regiment , and bogdánich knows it .
oh , we do prize it , old fellow !
and all this is not right , it s not right !
you may take offense or not but i always stick to mother truth .
it s not right ! and the staff captain rose and turned away from rostóv .
that s twue , devil take it ! shouted denísov , jumping up .
now then , wostóv , now then ! rostóv , growing red and pale alternately , looked first at one officer and then at the other .
no , gentlemen , no you mustn t think
i quite understand .
you re wrong to think that of me
i for me for the honor of the regiment i d ah well , i ll show that in action , and for me the honor of the flag well , never mind , it s true i m to blame , to blame all round .
well , what else do you want ? come , that s right , count ! cried the staff captain , turning round and clapping rostóv on the shoulder with his big hand .
i tell you , shouted denísov , he s a fine that s better , count , said the staff captain , beginning to address rostóv by his title , as if in recognition of his confession .
go and apologize , your excellency .
yes , go ! gentlemen , i ll do anything .
no one shall hear a word from me , said rostóv in an imploring voice , but i can t apologize , by god i can t , do what you will !
how can i go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness ? denísov began to laugh .
it ll be worse for you .
bogdánich is vindictive and you ll pay for your obstinacy , said kírsten .
no , on my word it s not obstinacy !
i can t describe the feeling .
i can t well , it s as you like , said the staff captain .
and what has become of that scoundrel ? he asked denísov .
he has weported himself sick , he s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow , muttered denísov .
it is an illness , there s no other way of explaining it , said the staff captain .
illness or not , he d better not cwoss my path .
i d kill him ! shouted denísov in a bloodthirsty tone .
just then zherkóv entered the room .
what brings you here ? cried the officers turning to the newcomer .
we re to go into action , gentlemen !
mack has surrendered with his whole it s not true ! i ve seen him myself ! what ?
saw the real mack ?
with hands and feet ? into action !
into action !
bring him a bottle for such news !
but how did you come here ? i ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil , mack .
an austrian general complained of me .
i congratulated him on mack s arrival what s the matter , rostóv ?
you look as if you d just come out of a hot oh , my dear fellow , we re in such a stew here these last two the regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by zherkóv .
they were under orders to advance next day .
we re going into action , gentlemen ! well , thank god !
we ve been sitting here too long ! kutúzov fell back toward vienna , destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers inn ( at braunau ) and traun ( near linz ) .
on october the russian troops were crossing the river enns .
at midday the russian baggage train , the artillery , and columns of troops were defiling through the town of enns on both sides of the bridge .
it was a warm , rainy , autumnal day .
the wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain , and then , suddenly spread out in the sunlight , objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished .
down below , the little town could be seen with its white , houses , its cathedral , and its bridge , on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of russian troops .
at the bend of the danube , vessels , an island , and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the enns and the danube became visible , and the rocky left bank of the danube covered with pine forests , with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges .
the turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest , and far away on the other side of the enns the enemy s horse patrols could be discerned .
among the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer , scanning the country through his fieldglass .
a little behind them nesvítski , who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief , was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage .
a cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask , and nesvítski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelkümmel .
the officers gladly gathered round him , some on their knees , some squatting turkish fashion on the wet grass .
yes , the austrian prince who built that castle was no fool .
it s a fine place !
why are you not eating anything , gentlemen ? nesvítski was saying .
thank you very much , prince , answered one of the officers , pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance .
it s a lovely place !
we passed close to the park and saw two deer and what a splendid house ! look , prince , said another , who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy , and therefore pretended to be examining the see , our infantrymen have already got there .
look there in the meadow behind the village , three of them are dragging something .
they ll ransack that castle , he remarked with evident approval .
so they will , said nesvítski .
no , but what i should like , added he , munching a pie in his handsome mouth , would be to slip in over he pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery , and his eyes narrowed and gleamed .
that would be fine , gentlemen ! the officers laughed .
just to flutter the nuns a bit .
they say there are italian girls among them .
on my word i d give five years of my life for it ! they must be feeling dull , too , said one of the bolder officers , laughing .
meanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general , who looked through his field glass .
yes , so it is , so it is , said the general angrily , lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders , so it is !
they ll be fired on at the crossing .
and why are they dawdling there ? on the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye , and from their battery a cloud arose .
then came the distant report of a shot , and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing .
nesvítski rose , puffing , and went up to the general , smiling .
would not your excellency like a little refreshment ? he said .
it s a bad business , said the general without answering him , our men have been wasting hadn t i better ride over , your excellency ? asked nesvítski .
yes , please do , answered the general , and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail and tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as i ordered ; and the inflammable material on the bridge must be very good , answered nesvítski .
he called the cossack with his horse , told him to put away the knapsack and flask , and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle .
i ll really call in on the nuns , he said to the officers who watched him smilingly , and he rode off by the winding path down the hill .
now then , let s see how far it will carry , captain .
just try ! said the general , turning to an artillery officer .
have a little fun to pass the crew , to your guns ! commanded the officer .
in a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading .
one ! came the command .
number one jumped briskly aside .
the gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar , and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy , a little smoke showing the spot where it burst .
the faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound .
everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below , as plainly visible as if but a stone s throw away , and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off .
at the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds , and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression .
two of the enemy s shots had already flown across the bridge , where there was a crush .
halfway across stood prince nesvítski , who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings .
he looked back laughing to the cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles .
each time prince nesvítski tried to move on , soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings , and all he could do was to smile .
what a fine fellow you are , friend ! said the cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon , who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses .
what a fellow !
you can t wait a moment !
don t you see the general wants to pass ? but the convoyman took no notice of the word general and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way .
hi there , boys !
keep to the left !
wait a but the soldiers , crowded together shoulder to shoulder , their bayonets interlocking , moved over the bridge in a dense mass .
looking down over the rails prince nesvítski saw the rapid , noisy little waves of the enns , which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along .
looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers , shoulder straps , covered shakos , knapsacks , bayonets , long muskets , and , under the shakos , faces with broad cheekbones , sunken cheeks , and listless tired expressions , and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge .
sometimes through the monotonous waves of men , like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the enns , an officer , in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men , squeezed his way along ; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river , an hussar on foot , an orderly , or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry ; and sometimes like a log floating down the river , an officers or company s baggage wagon , piled high , leather covered , and hemmed in on all sides , moved across the bridge .
it s as if a dam had burst , said the cossack hopelessly .
are there many more of you to come ? a million all but one ! replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat , with a wink , and passed on followed by another , an old man .
if he ( he meant the enemy ) begins popping at the bridge now , said the old soldier dismally to a comrade , you ll forget to scratch that soldier passed on , and after him came another sitting on a cart .
where the devil have the leg bands been shoved to ? said an orderly , running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it .
and he also passed on with the wagon .
then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking .
and then , old fellow , he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily , with a wide swing of his arm .
yes , the ham was just delicious answered another with a loud laugh .
and they , too , passed on , so that nesvítski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth , or what the ham had to do with it .
bah !
how they scurry .
he just sends a ball and they think they ll all be killed , a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully .
as it flies past me , daddy , the ball i mean , said a young soldier with an enormous mouth , hardly refraining from laughing , i felt like dying of fright .
i did , pon my word , i got that frightened ! said he , as if bragging of having been frightened .
that one also passed .
then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before .
it was a german cart with a pair of horses led by a german , and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects .
a fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind .
a woman with an unweaned baby , an old woman , and a healthy german girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds .
evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission .
the eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women , and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers remarks related to the two young ones .
every face bore almost the same smile , expressing unseemly thoughts about the women .
just see , the german sausage is making tracks , too ! sell me the missis , said another soldier , addressing the german , who , angry and frightened , strode energetically along with downcast eyes .
see how smart she s made herself !
oh , the devils ! there , fedótov , you should be quartered on them ! i have seen as much before now , mate ! where are you going ? asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple , also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl .
the german closed his eyes , signifying that he did not understand .
take it if you like , said the officer , giving the girl an apple .
the girl smiled and took it .
nesvítski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed .
when they had gone by , the same stream of soldiers followed , with the same kind of talk , and at last all stopped .
as often happens , the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge , and the whole crowd had to wait .
and why are they stopping ?
there s no proper order ! said the soldiers .
where are you shoving to ?
devil take you !
can t you wait ?
it ll be worse if he fires the bridge .
see , here s an officer jammed in too voices were saying in the crowd , as the men looked at one another , and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge .
looking down at the waters of the enns under the bridge , nesvítski suddenly heard a sound new to him , of something swiftly approaching something big , that splashed into the water .
just see where it carries to ! a soldier near by said sternly , looking round at the sound .
encouraging us to get along quicker , said another uneasily .
the crowd moved on again .
nesvítski realized that it was a cannon ball .
hey , cossack , my horse ! he said .
now , then , you there !
get out of the way !
make way ! with great difficulty he managed to get to his horse , and shouting continually he moved on .
the soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him , but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg , and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind .
nesvítski , nesvítski !
you numskull ! came a hoarse voice from behind him .
nesvítski looked round and saw , some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry , váska denísov , red and shaggy , with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder .
tell these devils , these fiends , to let me pass ! shouted denísov evidently in a fit of rage , his eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face .
ah , váska ! joyfully replied nesvítski .
what s up with you ? the squadwon can t pass , shouted váska denísov , showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred arab , which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it , and snorted , spurting white foam from his bit , tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs , and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him .
what is this ?
they re like sheep !
just like sheep !
out of the way !
let us pass !
stop there , you devil with the cart !
i ll hack you with my saber ! he shouted , actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it .
the soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces , and denísov joined nesvítski .
how s it you re not drunk today ? said nesvítski when the other had ridden up to him .
they don t even give one time to dwink ! answered váska denísov .
they keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day .
if they mean to fight , let s fight .
but the devil knows what this what a dandy you are today ! said nesvítski , looking at denísov s new cloak and saddlecloth .
denísov smiled , took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume , and put it to nesvítski s nose .
of course .
i m going into action !
i ve shaved , bwushed my teeth , and scented the imposing figure of nesvítski followed by his cossack , and the determination of denísov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically , had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry .
beside the bridge nesvítski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order , and having done this he rode back .
having cleared the way denísov stopped at the end of the bridge .
carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground , eager to rejoin its fellows , he watched his squadron draw nearer .
then the clang of hoofs , as of several horses galloping , resounded on the planks of the bridge , and the squadron , officers in front and men four abreast , spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it .
the infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of , estrangement , and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean , smart hussars who moved past them in regular order .
smart lads !
only fit for a fair ! said one .
what good are they ?
they re led about just for show ! remarked another .
don t kick up the dust , you infantry ! jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers .
i d like to put you on a two days march with a knapsack !
your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed , said an infantryman , wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve .
perched up there , you re more like a bird than a there now , zíkin , they ought to put you on a horse .
you d look fine , said a corporal , chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack .
take a stick between your legs , that ll suit you for a horse ! the hussar shouted back .
the last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge , squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel .
at last the baggage wagons had all crossed , the crush was less , and the last battalion came onto the bridge .
only denísov s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy , who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge , for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away .
at the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our cossack scouts were moving .
suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground , artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen .
these were the french .
a group of cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot .
all the officers and men of denísov s squadron , though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions , thought only of what was there on the hilltop , and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline , which they knew to be the enemy s troops .
the weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the danube and the dark hills around it .
it was calm , and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill .
there was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers .
an empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them .
the enemy ceased firing , and that stern , threatening , inaccessible , and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt .
one step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty , suffering , and death .
and what is there ?
who is there ? beyond that field , that tree , that roof lit up by the sun ?
no one knows , but one wants to know .
you fear and yet long to cross that line , and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there , just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death .
but you are strong , healthy , cheerful , and excited , and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy so thinks , or at any rate feels , anyone who comes in sight of the enemy , and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments .
on the high ground where the enemy was , the smoke of a cannon rose , and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron .
the officers who had been standing together rode off to their places .
the hussars began carefully aligning their horses .
silence fell on the whole squadron .
all were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander , awaiting the word of command .
a second and a third cannon ball flew past .
evidently they were firing at the hussars , but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them .
the hussars did not look round , but at the sound of each shot , as at the word of command , the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different , holding its breath while the ball flew past , rose in the stirrups and sank back again .
the soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another , curious to see their comrades impression .
every face , from denísov s to that of the bugler , showed one common expression of conflict , irritation , and excitement , around chin and mouth .
the quartermaster frowned , looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them .
cadet mirónov ducked every time a ball flew past .
rostóv on the left flank , mounted on his handsome horse despite its game the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself .
he was glancing at everyone with a clear , bright expression , as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire .
but despite himself , on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth .
who s that curtseying there ?
cadet miwónov !
that s not wight !
look at me , cried denísov who , unable to keep still on one spot , kept turning his horse in front of the squadron .
the black , hairy , face of váska denísov , and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber , looked just as it usually did , especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle ; he was only redder than usual .
with his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink , pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse , bedouin , and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle , he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols .
he rode up to kírsten .
the staff captain on his , steady mare came at a walk to meet him .
his face with its long mustache was serious as always , only his eyes were brighter than usual .
well , what about it ? said he to denísov .
it won t come to a fight .
you ll shall the devil only knows what they re about ! muttered denísov .
ah , wostóv , he cried noticing the cadet s bright face , you ve got it at and he smiled approvingly , evidently pleased with the cadet .
rostóv felt perfectly happy .
just then the commander appeared on the bridge .
denísov galloped up to him .
your excellency !
let us attack them !
i ll dwive them attack indeed ! said the colonel in a bored voice , puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly .
and why are you stopping here ?
don t you see the skirmishers are retreating ?
lead the squadron the squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man .
the second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last cossacks quitted the farther side of the river .
the two pávlograd squadrons , having crossed the bridge , retired up the hill one after the other .
their colonel , karl bogdánich schubert , came up to denísov s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from rostóv , without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning telyánin .
rostóv , feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame , did not lift his eyes from the colonel s athletic back , his nape covered with light hair , and his red neck .
it seemed to rostóv that bogdánich was only pretending not to notice him , and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet s courage , so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily ; then it seemed to him that bogdánich rode so near in order to show him his courage .
next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish .
then he imagined how , after the attack , bogdánich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation .
the figure of zherkóv , familiar to the pávlograds as he had but recently left their regiment , rode up to the colonel .
after his dismissal from headquarters zherkóv had not remained in the regiment , saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff , and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to prince bagratión .
he now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard .
colonel , he said , addressing rostóv s enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades , there is an order to stop and fire the an order to who ? asked the colonel morosely .
i don t myself know to who , replied the cornet in a serious tone , but the prince told me to go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the zherkóv was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order .
after him the stout nesvítski came galloping up on a cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight .
how s this , colonel ? he shouted as he approached .
i told you to fire the bridge , and now someone has gone and blundered ; they are all beside themselves over there and one can t make anything the colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to nesvítski .
you spoke to me of inflammable material , said he , but you said nothing about firing but , my dear sir , said nesvítski as he drew up , taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand , wasn t i telling you to fire the bridge , when inflammable material had been put in position ? i am not your dear sir , staff officer , and you did not tell me to burn the bridge !
i know the service , and it is my habit orders strictly to obey .
you said the bridge would be burned , but who would it burn , i could not know by the holy spirit ! ah , that s always the way ! said nesvítski with a wave of the hand .
how did you get here ? said he , turning to zherkóv .
on the same business .
but you are damp !
let me wring you out ! you were saying , staff officer continued the colonel in an offended tone .
colonel , interrupted the officer of the suite , you must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use the colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite , at the stout staff officer , and at zherkóv , and he frowned .
i will the bridge fire , he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing .
striking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything , the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron , that in which rostóv was serving under denísov , to return to the bridge .
there , it s just as i thought , said rostóv to himself .
he wishes to test me ! his heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face .
let him see whether i am a coward ! he thought .
again on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire .
rostóv watched his enemy , the colonel , find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture , but the colonel did not once glance at rostóv , and looked as he always did when at the front , solemn and stern .
then came the word of command .
look sharp !
look sharp ! several voices repeated around him .
their sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling , the hussars hastily dismounted , not knowing what they were to do .
the men were crossing themselves .
rostóv no longer looked at the colonel , he had no time .
he was afraid of falling behind the hussars , so much afraid that his heart stood still .
his hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly s charge , and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud .
denísov rode past him , leaning back and shouting something .
rostóv saw nothing but the hussars running all around him , their spurs catching and their sabers clattering .
stretchers ! shouted someone behind him .
rostóv did not think what this call for stretchers meant ; he ran on , trying only to be ahead of the others ; but just at the bridge , not looking at the ground , he came on some sticky , trodden mud , stumbled , and fell on his hands .
the others outstripped him .
at boss zides , captain , he heard the voice of the colonel , who , having ridden ahead , had pulled up his horse near the bridge , with a triumphant , cheerful face .
rostóv wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on , thinking that the farther he went to the front the better .
but bogdánich , without looking at or recognizing rostóv , shouted to him who s that running on the middle of the bridge ?
to the right !
come back , cadet ! he cried angrily ; and turning to denísov , who , showing off his courage , had ridden on to the planks of the bridge why run risks , captain ?
you should dismount , he said .
oh , every bullet has its billet , answered váska denísov , turning in his saddle .
meanwhile nesvítski , zherkóv , and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots , watching , now the small group of men with yellow shakos , jackets braided with cord , and blue riding breeches , who were swarming near the bridge , and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite blue uniforms and groups with horses , easily recognizable as artillery .
will they burn the bridge or not ?
who ll get there first ?
will they get there and fire the bridge or will the french get within grapeshot range and wipe them out ? these were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns .
ugh .
the hussars will get it hot ! said nesvítski ; they are within grapeshot range he shouldn t have taken so many men , said the officer of the suite .
true enough , answered nesvítski ; two smart fellows could have done the job just as ah , your excellency , put in zherkóv , his eyes fixed on the hussars , but still with that naïve air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest .
ah , your excellency !
how you look at things !
send two men ?
and who then would give us the vladímir medal and ribbon ?
but now , even if they do get peppered , the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon .
our bogdánich knows how things are there now ! said the officer of the suite , that s he pointed to the french guns , the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed .
on the french side , amid the groups with cannon , a cloud of smoke appeared , then a second and a third almost simultaneously , and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen .
then two reports one after another , and a third .
oh !
oh ! groaned nesvítski as if in fierce pain , seizing the officer of the suite by the arm .
look !
a man has fallen !
fallen , fallen ! two , i if i were tsar i would never go to war , said nesvítski , turning away .
the french guns were hastily reloaded .
the infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run .
smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals , and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge .
but this time nesvítski could not see what was happening there , as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it .
the hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the french batteries were now firing at them , no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at .
the french had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses .
two were misdirected and the shot went too high , but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over .
rostóv , absorbed by his relations with bogdánich , had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do .
there was no one to hew down ( as he had always imagined battles to himself ) , nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers .
he stood looking about him , when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt , and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan .
rostóv ran up to him with the others .
again someone shouted , stretchers ! four men seized the hussar and began lifting him .
oooh !
for christ s sake let me alone ! cried the wounded man , but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher .
nicholas rostóv turned away and , as if searching for something , gazed into the distance , at the waters of the danube , at the sky , and at the sun .
how beautiful the sky looked ; how blue , how calm , and how deep !
how bright and glorious was the setting sun !
with what soft glitter the waters of the distant danube shone .
and fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river , the nunnery , the mysterious gorges , and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits
there was peace and happiness i should wish for nothing else , nothing , if only i were there , thought rostóv .
in myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness ; but here groans , suffering , fear , and this uncertainty and hurry are shouting again , and again are all running back somewhere , and i shall run with them , and it , death , is here above me and around another instant and i shall never again see the sun , this water , that gorge ! at that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds , and other stretchers came into view before rostóv .
and the fear of death and of the stretchers , and love of the sun and of life , all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation .
o lord god !
thou who art in that heaven , save , forgive , and protect me ! rostóv whispered .
the hussars ran back to the men who held their horses ; their voices sounded louder and calmer , the stretchers disappeared from sight .
well , fwiend ?
so you ve smelt powdah ! shouted váska denísov just above his ear .
it s all over ; but i am a , a coward ! thought rostóv , and sighing deeply he took rook , his horse , which stood resting one foot , from the orderly and began to mount .
was that grapeshot ? he asked denísov .
yes and no mistake ! cried denísov .
you worked like wegular bwicks and it s nasty work !
an attack s pleasant work !
hacking away at the dogs !
but this sort of thing is the very devil , with them shooting at you like a and denísov rode up to a group that had stopped near rostóv , composed of the colonel , nesvítski , zherkóv , and the officer from the suite .
well , it seems that no one has noticed , thought rostóv .
and this was true .
no one had taken any notice , for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced .
here s something for you to report , said zherkóv .
see if i don t get promoted to a inform the prince that i the bridge fired ! said the colonel triumphantly and gaily .
and if he asks about the losses ? a trifle , said the colonel in his bass voice two hussars wounded , and one knocked out , he added , unable to restrain a happy smile , and pronouncing the phrase knocked out with ringing distinctness .
pursued by the french army of a hundred thousand men under the command of bonaparte , encountering a population that was unfriendly to it , losing confidence in its allies , suffering from shortness of supplies , and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen , the russian army of thousand men commanded by kutúzov was hurriedly retreating along the danube , stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment .
there had been actions at lambach , amstetten , and melk ; but despite the courage and even by the which the russians fought , the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat .
austrian troops that had escaped capture at ulm and had joined kutúzov at braunau now separated from the russian army , and kutúzov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces .
the defense of vienna was no longer to be thought of .
instead of an offensive , the plan of which , carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics , had been handed to kutúzov when he was in vienna by the austrian hofkriegsrath , the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from russia , without losing his army as mack had done at ulm .
on the of october kutúzov with his army crossed to the left bank of the danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the french .
on the thirtieth he attacked mortier s division , which was on the left bank , and broke it up .
in this action for the first time trophies were taken banners , cannon , and two enemy generals .
for the first time , after a fortnight s retreat , the russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the french .
though the troops were , exhausted , and had lost a third of their number in killed , wounded , sick , and stragglers ; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the danube with a letter in which kutúzov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy ; and though the big hospitals and the houses in krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded , yet the stand made at krems and the victory over mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably .
throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from russia , of some victory gained by the austrians , and of the retreat of the frightened bonaparte .
prince andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the austrian general schmidt , who was killed in the action .
his horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet .
as a mark of the commander in chief s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the austrian court , now no longer at vienna ( which was threatened by the french ) but at brünn .
despite his apparently delicate build prince andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men , and on the night of the battle , having arrived at krems excited but not weary , with dispatches from dokhtúrov to kutúzov , he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to brünn .
to be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion .
the night was dark but starry , the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day of the battle .
reviewing his impressions of the recent battle , picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create , or recalling the given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers , prince andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a happiness .
as soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory .
then he began to imagine that the russians were running away and that he himself was killed , but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy , as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the french had run away .
he again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle , and feeling reassured he dozed off
the dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning .
the snow was thawing in the sunshine , the horses galloped quickly , and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds , fields , and villages .
at one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of russian wounded .
the russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart , shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse .
in each of the long german carts six or more pale , dirty , bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road .
some of them were talking ( he heard russian words ) , others were eating bread ; the more severely wounded looked silently , with the languid interest of sick children , at the envoy hurrying past them .
prince andrew told his driver to stop , and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded .
day before yesterday , on the danube , answered the soldier .
prince andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces .
that s for them all , he said to the officer who came up .
get well soon , lads ! he continued , turning to the soldiers .
there s plenty to do what news , sir ? asked the officer , evidently anxious to start a conversation .
good news !
go on ! he shouted to the driver , and they galloped on .
it was already quite dark when prince andrew rattled over the paved streets of brünn and found himself surrounded by high buildings , the lights of shops , houses , and street lamps , fine carriages , and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life .
despite his rapid journey and sleepless night , prince andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before .
only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity .
he again vividly recalled the details of the battle , no longer dim , but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the emperor francis .
he vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give .
he expected to be at once presented to the emperor .
at the chief entrance to the palace , however , an official came running out to meet him , and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance .
to the right from the corridor , euer hochgeboren !
there you will find the adjutant on duty , said the official .
he will conduct you to the minister of the adjutant on duty , meeting prince andrew , asked him to wait , and went in to the minister of war .
five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered prince andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the minister of war was at work .
the adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the russian messenger .
prince andrew s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister s room .
he felt offended , and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for .
his fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister .
away from the smell of powder , they probably think it easy to gain victories ! he thought .
his eyes narrowed disdainfully , he entered the room of the minister of war with peculiarly deliberate steps .
this feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them , and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival .
a wax candle stood at each side of the minister s bent bald head with its gray temples .
he went on reading to the end , without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps .
take this and deliver it , said he to his adjutant , handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger .
prince andrew felt that either the actions of kutúzov s army interested the minister of war less than any of the other matters he was concerned with , or he wanted to give the russian special messenger that impression .
but that is a matter of perfect indifference to me , he thought .
the minister drew the remaining papers together , arranged them evenly , and then raised his head .
he had an intellectual and distinctive head , but the instant he turned to prince andrew the firm , intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him .
his face took on the stupid artificial smile ( which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality ) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another .
from general field marshal kutúzov ? he asked .
i hope it is good news ?
there has been an encounter with mortier ?
a victory ?
it was high time ! he took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression .
oh , my god !
my god !
schmidt ! he exclaimed in german .
what a calamity !
what a calamity ! having glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at prince andrew , evidently considering something .
ah what a calamity !
you say the affair was decisive ?
but mortier is not again he pondered .
i am very glad you have brought good news , though schmidt s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory .
his majesty will no doubt wish to see you , but not today .
i thank you !
you must have a rest .
be at the levee tomorrow after the parade .
however , i will let you the stupid smile , which had left his face while he was speaking , reappeared .
au revoir !
thank you very much .
his majesty will probably desire to see you , he added , bowing his head .
when prince andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the minister of war and the polite adjutant .
the whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed ; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past .
prince andrew stayed at brünn with bilíbin , a russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service .
ah , my dear prince !
i could not have a more welcome visitor , said bilíbin as he came out to meet prince andrew .
franz , put the prince s things in my bedroom , said he to the servant who was ushering bolkónski in .
so you re a messenger of victory , eh ?
splendid !
and i am sitting here ill , as you after washing and dressing , prince andrew came into the diplomat s luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him .
bilíbin settled down comfortably beside the fire .
after his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life , prince andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood .
besides it was pleasant , after his reception by the austrians , to speak if not in russian ( for they were speaking french ) at least with a russian who would , he supposed , share the general russian antipathy to the austrians which was then particularly strong .
bilíbin was a man of , a bachelor , and of the same circle as prince andrew .
they had known each other previously in petersburg , but had become more intimate when prince andrew was in vienna with kutúzov .
just as prince andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession , so to an even greater extent bilíbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career .
he still a young man but no longer a young diplomat , as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen , had been in paris and copenhagen , and now held a rather important post in vienna .
both the foreign minister and our ambassador in vienna knew him and valued him .
he was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities , avoid doing certain things , and speak french .
he was one of those , who , liking work , knew how to do it , and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table .
he worked well whatever the import of his work .
it was not the question what for ? but the question how ? that interested him .
what the diplomatic matter might be he did not care , but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular , memorandum , or report , skillfully , pointedly , and elegantly .
bilíbin s services were valued not only for what he wrote , but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres .
bilíbin liked conversation as he liked work , only when it could be made elegantly witty .
in society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible .
his conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original , finished phrases of general interest .
these sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally , so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room .
and , in fact , bilíbin s witticisms were hawked about in the viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important .
his thin , worn , sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles , which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one s fingers after a russian bath .
the movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face .
now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted , then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks .
his small , eyes always twinkled and looked out straight .
well , now tell me about your exploits , said he .
bolkónski , very modestly without once mentioning himself , described the engagement and his reception by the minister of war .
they received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles , said he in conclusion .
bilíbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared .
cependant , mon cher , he remarked , examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye , malgré la haute estime que je professe pour the orthodox russian army , j avoue que votre victoire n est pas des plus but my dear fellow , with all my respect for the orthodox russian army , i must say that your victory was not particularly he went on talking in this way in french , uttering only those words in russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis .
come now !
you with all your forces fall on the unfortunate mortier and his one division , and even then mortier slips through your fingers !
where s the victory ? but seriously , said prince andrew , we can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at ulm why didn t you capture one , just one , marshal for us ? because not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade .
we had expected , as i told you , to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the and why didn t you do it at seven in the morning ?
you ought to have been there at seven in the morning , returned bilíbin with a smile .
you ought to have been there at seven in the why did you not succeed in impressing on bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave genoa alone ? retorted prince andrew in the same tone .
i know , interrupted bilíbin , you re thinking it s very easy to take marshals , sitting on a sofa by the fire !
that is true , but still why didn t you capture him ?
so don t be surprised if not only the minister of war but also his most august majesty the emperor and king francis is not much delighted by your victory .
even i , a poor secretary of the russian embassy , do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my franz a thaler , or let him go with his liebchen to the prater
true , we have no prater here he looked straight at prince andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead .
it is now my turn to ask you why ? mon cher , said bolkónski .
i confess i do not understand perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence , but i can t make it out .
mack loses a whole army , the archduke ferdinand and the archduke karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder .
kutúzov alone at last gains a real victory , destroying the spell of the invincibility of the french , and the minister of war does not even care to hear the that s just it , my dear fellow .
you see it s hurrah for the tsar , for russia , for the orthodox greek faith !
all that is beautiful , but what do we , i mean the austrian court , care for your victories ?
bring us nice news of a victory by the archduke karl or ferdinand ( one archduke s as good as another , as you know ) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of bonaparte s , that will be another story and we ll fire off some cannon !
but this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us .
the archduke karl does nothing , the archduke ferdinand disgraces himself .
you abandon vienna , give up its much as to say heaven is with us , but heaven help you and your capital ! the one general whom we all loved , schmidt , you expose to a bullet , and then you congratulate us on the victory !
admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived .
it s as if it had been done on purpose , on purpose .
besides , suppose you did gain a brilliant victory , if even the archduke karl gained a victory , what effect would that have on the general course of events ?
it s too late now when vienna is occupied by the french army ! what ?
occupied ?
vienna occupied ? not only occupied , but bonaparte is at schönbrunn , and the count , our dear count vrbna , goes to him for after the fatigues and impressions of the journey , his reception , and especially after having dined , bolkónski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard .
count lichtenfels was here this morning , bilíbin continued , and showed me a letter in which the parade of the french in vienna was fully described prince murat et tout le tremblement you see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can t be received as a really i don t care about that , i don t care at all , said prince andrew , beginning to understand that his news of the battle before krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of austria s capital .
how is it vienna was taken ?
what of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and prince auersperg ?
we heard reports that prince auersperg was defending vienna ? he said .
prince auersperg is on this , on our side of the river , and is defending it very badly , i think , but still he is defending us .
but vienna is on the other side .
no , the bridge has not yet been taken and i hope it will not be , for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up .
otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of bohemia , and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two but still this does not mean that the campaign is over , said prince andrew .
well , i think it is .
the bigwigs here think so too , but they daren t say so .
it will be as i said at the beginning of the campaign , it won t be your skirmishing at dürrenstein , or gunpowder at all , that will decide the matter , but those who devised it , said bilíbin quoting one of his own mots , releasing the wrinkles on his forehead , and pausing .
the only question is what will come of the meeting between the emperor alexander and the king of prussia in berlin ?
if prussia joins the allies , austria s hand will be forced and there will be war .
if not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new campo formio are to be drawn what an extraordinary genius ! prince andrew suddenly exclaimed , clenching his small hand and striking the table with it , and what luck the man has ! buonaparte ? said bilíbin inquiringly , puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty .
buonaparte ? he repeated , accentuating the u i think , however , now that he lays down laws for austria at schönbrunn , il faut lui faire grâce de l u !
i shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply bonaparte ! we must let him off the u ! but joking apart , said prince andrew , do you really think the campaign is over ? this is what i think .
austria has been made a fool of , and she is not used to it .
she will retaliate .
and she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been say the holy russian army loots army is destroyed , her capital taken , and all this for the beaux yeux of his sardinian majesty .
and is between instinctively feel that we are being deceived , my instinct tells me of negotiations with france and projects for peace , a secret peace concluded fine eyes .
impossible ! cried prince andrew .
that would be too if we live we shall see , replied bilíbin , his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end .
when prince andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows , he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far , far away from him .
the alliance with prussia , austria s treachery , bonaparte s new triumph , tomorrow s levee and parade , and the audience with the emperor francis occupied his thoughts .
he closed his eyes , and immediately a sound of cannonading , of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears , and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill , the french were firing , and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around , and he experienced tenfold the joy of living , as he had not done since childhood .
he woke up yes , that all happened ! he said , and , smiling happily to himself like a child , he fell into a deep , youthful slumber .
next day he woke late .
recalling his recent impressions , the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the emperor francis ; he remembered the minister of war , the polite austrian adjutant , bilíbin , and last night s conversation .
having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform , which he had not worn for a long time , he went into bilíbin s study fresh , animated , and handsome , with his hand bandaged .
in the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps .
with prince hippolyte kurágin , who was a secretary to the embassy , bolkónski was already acquainted .
bilíbin introduced him to the others .
the gentlemen assembled at bilíbin s were young , wealthy , gay society men , who here , as in vienna , formed a special set which bilíbin , their leader , called les nôtres .
this set , consisting almost exclusively of diplomats , evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society , to certain women , and to the official side of the service .
these gentlemen received prince andrew as one of themselves , an honor they did not extend to many .
from politeness and to start conversation , they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle , and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip .
ours .
but the best of it was , said one , telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat , that the chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to london was a promotion and that he was so to regard it .
can you fancy the figure he cut ? but the worst of it , am giving kurágin away to that that man suffers , and this don juan , wicked fellow , is taking advantage of it ! prince hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm .
he began to laugh .
tell me about that ! he said .
oh , you don juan !
you serpent ! cried several voices .
you , bolkónski , don t know , said bilíbin turning to prince andrew , that all the atrocities of the french army ( i nearly said of the russian army ) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women ! la femme est la compagne de l homme , announced prince hippolyte , and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs .
woman is man s bilíbin and the rest of ours burst out laughing in hippolyte s face , and prince andrew saw that hippolyte , of had to had almost been jealous on his wife s account , was the butt of this set .
oh , i must give you a treat , bilíbin whispered to bolkónski .
kurágin is exquisite when he discusses should see his gravity ! he sat down beside hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics .
prince andrew and the others gathered round these two .
the berlin cabinet can not express a feeling of alliance , began hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others , without expressing as in its last note you understand
besides , unless his majesty the emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance wait , i have not finished he said to prince andrew , seizing him by the arm , i believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention .
and he paused .
finally one can not impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of november .
that is how it will and he released bolkónski s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished .
demosthenes , i know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth ! said bilíbin , and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction .
everybody laughed , and hippolyte louder than anyone .
he was evidently distressed , and breathed painfully , but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features .
well now , gentlemen , said bilíbin , bolkónski is my guest in this house and in brünn itself .
i want to entertain him as far as i can , with all the pleasures of life here .
if we were in vienna it would be easy , but here , in this wretched moravian hole , it is more difficult , and i beg you all to help me .
brünn s attractions must be shown him .
you can undertake the theater , i society , and you , hippolyte , of course the we must let him see amelie , she s exquisite ! said one of ours , kissing his finger tips .
in general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests , said bilíbin .
i shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality , gentlemen , it is already time for me to go , replied prince andrew looking at his watch .
where to ? to the oh !
oh !
oh ! well , au revoir , bolkónski !
au revoir , prince !
come back early to dinner , cried several voices .
we ll take you in when speaking to the emperor , try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated , said bilíbin , accompanying him to the hall .
i should like to speak well of them , but as far as i know the facts , i can t , replied bolkónski , smiling .
well , talk as much as you can , anyway .
he has a passion for giving audiences , but he does not like talking himself and can t do it , as you will at the levee prince andrew stood among the austrian officers as he had been told to , and the emperor francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head .
but after it was over , the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed bolkónski that the emperor desired to give him an audience .
the emperor francis received him standing in the middle of the room .
before the conversation began prince andrew was struck by the fact that the emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say .
tell me , when did the battle begin ? he asked hurriedly .
prince andrew replied .
then followed other questions just as simple was kutúzov well ?
when had he left krems ? and so on .
the emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of answers to these questions , as was only too evident , did not interest him .
at what o clock did the battle begin ? asked the emperor .
i can not inform your majesty at what o clock the battle began at the front , but at dürrenstein , where i was , our attack began after five in the afternoon , replied bolkónski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account , which he had ready in his mind , of all he knew and had seen .
but the emperor smiled and interrupted him .
how many miles ? from where to where , your majesty ? from dürrenstein to three and a half miles , your the french have abandoned the left bank ? according to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the is there sufficient forage in krems ? forage has not been supplied to the extent the emperor interrupted him .
at what o clock was general schmidt killed ? at seven o clock , i at seven o clock ?
it s very sad , very sad ! the emperor thanked prince andrew and bowed .
prince andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides .
everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words .
yesterday s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace , and offered him his own house .
the minister of war came up and congratulated him on the maria theresa order of the third grade , which the emperor was conferring on him .
the empress chamberlain invited him to see her majesty .
the archduchess also wished to see him .
he did not know whom to answer , and for a few seconds collected his thoughts .
then the russian ambassador took him by the shoulder , led him to the window , and began to talk to him .
contrary to bilíbin s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received .
a thanksgiving service was arranged , kutúzov was awarded the grand cross of maria theresa , and the whole army received rewards .
bolkónski was invited everywhere , and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal austrian dignitaries .
between four and five in the afternoon , having made all his calls , he was returning to bilíbin s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to brünn .
at the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage .
franz , bilíbin s man , was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door .
before returning to bilíbin s prince andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign , and had spent some time in the shop .
what is it ? he asked .
oh , your excellency ! said franz , with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle , we are to move on still farther .
the scoundrel is again at our heels ! eh ?
what ? asked prince andrew .
bilíbin came out to meet him .
his usually calm face showed excitement .
there now !
confess that this is delightful , said he .
this affair of the thabor bridge , at vienna
they have crossed without striking a blow ! prince andrew could not understand .
but where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows ? i come from the archduchess .
i heard nothing and you didn t see that everybody is packing up ? i did not what is it all about ? inquired prince andrew impatiently .
what s it all about ?
why , the french have crossed the bridge that auersperg was defending , and the bridge was not blown up so murat is now rushing along the road to brünn and will be here in a day or what ?
here ?
but why did they not blow up the bridge , if it was mined ? that is what i ask you .
no one , not even bonaparte , knows bolkónski shrugged his shoulders .
but if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost ?
it will be cut off , said he .
that s just it , answered bilíbin .
listen !
the french entered vienna as i told you .
very well .
next day , which was yesterday , those gentlemen , messieurs les maréchaux , murat , lannes , and belliard , mount and ride to the bridge .
( observe that all three are gascons . )
gentlemen , says one of them , you know the thabor bridge is mined and doubly mined and that there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross ?
but it will please our sovereign the emperor napoleon if we take this bridge , so let us three go and take it ! yes , let s ! say the others .
and off they go and take the bridge , cross it , and now with their whole army are on this side of the danube , marching on us , you , and your lines of the marshalls .
stop jesting , said prince andrew sadly and seriously .
this news grieved him and yet he was pleased .
as soon as he learned that the russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position ; that here was the toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame !
listening to bilíbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army , and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan .
stop this jesting , he said .
i am not jesting , bilíbin went on .
nothing is truer or sadder .
these gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs ; they assure the officer on duty that they , the marshals , are on their way to negotiate with prince auersperg .
he lets them enter the .
they spin him a thousand gasconades , saying that the war is over , that the emperor francis is arranging a meeting with bonaparte , that they desire to see prince auersperg , and so on .
the officer sends for auersperg ; these gentlemen embrace the officers , crack jokes , sit on the cannon , and meanwhile a french battalion gets to the bridge unobserved , flings the bags of incendiary material into the water , and approaches the .
at length appears the lieutenant general , our dear prince auersperg von mautern himself .
dearest foe !
flower of the austrian army , hero of the turkish wars !
hostilities are ended , we can shake one another s hand
the emperor napoleon burns with impatience to make prince auersperg s in a word , those gentlemen , gascons indeed , so bewildered him with fine words , and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the french marshals , and so dazzled by the sight of murat s mantle and ostrich plumes , qu il n y voit que du feu , et oublie celui qu il devait faire faire sur l ennemi ! ( ) in spite of the animation of his speech , bilíbin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation .
the french battalion rushes to the bridgehead , spikes the guns , and the bridge is taken !
but what is best of all , he went on , his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story , is that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge , this sergeant , seeing that the french troops were running onto the bridge , was about to fire , but lannes stayed his hand .
the sergeant , who was evidently wiser than his general , goes up to auersperg and says prince , you are being deceived , here are the french ! murat , seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak , turns to auersperg with feigned astonishment ( he is a true gascon ) and says i don t recognize the austrian discipline , if you allow a subordinate to address you like that ! it was a stroke of genius .
prince auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested .
come , you must own that this affair of the thabor bridge is delightful !
it is not exactly stupidity , nor rascality bridgehead .
( ) that their fire gets into his eyes and he forgets that he ought to be firing at the enemy .
it may be treachery , said prince andrew , vividly imagining the gray overcoats , wounds , the smoke of gunpowder , the sounds of firing , and the glory that awaited him .
not that either .
that puts the court in too bad a light , replied bilíbin .
it s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity it is just as at ulm it is seemed to be trying to find the right expression .
c est c est du mack .
nous sommes mackés ( it is it is a bit of mack .
we are macked ) , he concluded , feeling that he had produced a good epigram , a fresh one that would be repeated .
his hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure , and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails .
where are you off to ? he said suddenly to prince andrew who had risen and was going toward his room .
i am going where to ? to the but you meant to stay another two days ? but now i am off at and prince andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room .
do you know , mon cher , said bilíbin following him , i have been thinking about you .
why are you going ? and in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face .
prince andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply .
why are you going ?
i know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger .
i understand that .
mon cher , it is heroism ! not at all , said prince andrew .
but as you are a philosopher , be a consistent one , look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty , on the contrary , is to take care of yourself .
leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else you have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here ; therefore , you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us .
they say we are going to olmütz , and olmütz is a very decent town .
you and i will travel comfortably in my do stop joking , bilíbin , cried bolkónski .
i am speaking sincerely as a friend !
consider !
where and why are you going , when you might remain here ?
you are faced by one of two things , and the skin over his left temple puckered , either you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded , or you will share defeat and disgrace with kutúzov s whole and bilíbin unwrinkled his temple , feeling that the dilemma was insoluble .
i can not argue about it , replied prince andrew coldly , but he thought i am going to save the my dear fellow , you are a hero ! said bilíbin .
that same night , having taken leave of the minister of war , bolkónski set off to rejoin the army , not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the french on the way to krems .
in brünn everybody attached to the court was packing up , and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to olmütz .
near hetzelsdorf prince andrew struck the high road along which the russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder .
the road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage .
prince andrew took a horse and a cossack from a cossack commander , and hungry and weary , making his way past the baggage wagons , rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage .
very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along , and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors .
cette armée russe que l or de l angleterre a transportée des extrémités de l univers , nous allons lui faire éprouver le même ( le sort de l armée d ulm ) . he remembered these words in bonaparte s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign , and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero , a feeling of wounded pride , and a hope of glory .
and should there be nothing left but to die ? he thought .
well , if need be , i shall do it no worse than that russian army which has been brought from the ends of the earth by english gold , we shall cause to share the same ( the fate of the army at ulm ) . he looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments , carts , guns , artillery , and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road , three and sometimes four abreast .
from all sides , behind and before , as far as ear could reach , there were the rattle of wheels , the creaking of carts and gun carriages , the tramp of horses , the crack of whips , shouts , the urging of horses , and the swearing of soldiers , orderlies , and officers .
all along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen , some flayed , some not , and carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something , and again soldiers straggling from their companies , crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages , or returned from them dragging sheep , fowls , hay , and bulging sacks .
at each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant .
soldiers floundering in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves .
whips cracked , hoofs slipped , traces broke , and lungs were strained with shouting .
the officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts .
their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder .
here is our dear orthodox russian army , thought bolkónski , recalling bilíbin s words .
wishing to find out where the commander in chief was , he rode up to a convoy .
directly opposite to him came a strange vehicle , evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart , a cabriolet , and a calèche .
a soldier was driving , and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle .
prince andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle .
an officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others , and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage .
the woman screamed piercingly .
seeing prince andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and , waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl , cried mr .
!
mr .
!
for heaven s sake
protect me !
what will become of us ?
i am the wife of the doctor of the seventh chasseurs
they won t let us pass , we are left behind and have lost our people i ll flatten you into a pancake ! shouted the angry officer to the soldier .
turn back with your slut ! mr .
!
help me !
what does it all mean ? screamed the doctor s wife .
kindly let this cart pass .
don t you see it s a woman ? said prince andrew riding up to the officer .
the officer glanced at him , and without replying turned again to the soldier .
i ll teach you to push on !
back ! let them pass , i tell you ! repeated prince andrew , compressing his lips .
and who are you ? cried the officer , turning on him with tipsy rage , who are you ?
are you in command here ?
eh ?
i am commander here , not you !
go back or i ll flatten you into a pancake , repeated he .
this expression evidently pleased him .
that was a nice snub for the little , came a voice from behind .
prince andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless , tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying .
he saw that his championship of the doctor s wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the ridicule ; but his instinct urged him on .
before the officer finished his sentence prince andrew , his face distorted with fury , rode up to him and raised his riding whip .
kind ly ! the officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away .
it s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there s this disorder , he muttered .
do as you prince andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor s wife , who was calling him her deliverer , and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told that the commander in chief was .
on reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house , intending to rest if but for a moment , eat something , and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind .
this is a mob of scoundrels and not an army , he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house , when a familiar voice called him by name .
he turned round .
nesvítski s handsome face looked out of the little window .
nesvítski , moving his moist lips as he chewed something , and flourishing his arm , called him to enter .
bolkónski !
bolkónski !
don t you hear ?
eh ?
come quick he shouted .
entering the house , prince andrew saw nesvítski and another adjutant having something to eat .
they hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news .
on their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm .
this was particularly noticeable on nesvítski s usually laughing countenance .
where is the commander in chief ? asked bolkónski .
here , in that house , answered the adjutant .
well , is it true that it s peace and capitulation ? asked nesvítski .
i was going to ask you .
i know nothing except that it was all i could do to get and we , my dear boy !
it s terrible !
i was wrong to laugh at mack , we re getting it still worse , said nesvítski .
but sit down and have something to you won t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now , prince .
and god only knows where your man peter is , said the other adjutant .
where are headquarters ? we are to spend the night in well , i have got all i need into packs for two horses , said nesvítski .
they ve made up splendid packs for to cross the bohemian mountains with .
it s a bad lookout , old fellow !
but what s the matter with you ?
you must be ill to shiver like that , he added , noticing that prince andrew winced as at an electric shock .
it s nothing , replied prince andrew .
he had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor s wife and the convoy officer .
what is the commander in chief doing here ? he asked .
i can t make out at all , said nesvítski .
well , all i can make out is that everything is abominable , abominable , quite abominable ! said prince andrew , and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was .
passing by kutúzov s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite , with their cossacks who were talking loudly together , prince andrew entered the passage .
kutúzov himself , he was told , was in the house with prince bagratión and weyrother .
weyrother was the austrian general who had succeeded schmidt .
in the passage little kozlóvski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk .
the clerk , with cuffs turned up , was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards .
kozlóvski s face looked too had evidently not slept all night .
he glanced at prince andrew and did not even nod to him .
second line have you written it ? he continued dictating to the clerk .
the kiev grenadiers , podolian one can t write so fast , your honor , said the clerk , glancing angrily and disrespectfully at kozlóvski .
through the door came the sounds of kutúzov s voice , excited and dissatisfied , interrupted by another , an unfamiliar voice .
from the sound of these voices , the inattentive way kozlóvski looked at him , the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk , the fact that the clerk and kozlóvski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief , and from the noisy laughter of the cossacks holding the horses near the window , prince andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen .
he turned to kozlóvski with urgent questions .
immediately , prince , said kozlóvski .
dispositions for what about capitulation ? nothing of the sort .
orders are issued for a prince andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard .
just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased , the door opened , and kutúzov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway .
prince andrew stood right in front of kutúzov but the expression of the commander in chief s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence .
he looked straight at his adjutant s face without recognizing him .
well , have you finished ? said he to kozlóvski .
one moment , your bagratión , a gaunt man of medium height with a firm , impassive face of oriental type , came out after the commander in chief .
i have the honor to present myself , repeated prince andrew rather loudly , handing kutúzov an envelope .
ah , from vienna ?
very good .
later , later ! kutúzov went out into the porch with bagratión .
well , , prince , said he to bagratión .
my blessing , and may christ be with you in your great endeavor ! his face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes .
with his left hand he drew bagratión toward him , and with his right , on which he wore a ring , he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual , offering his puffy cheek , but bagratión kissed him on the neck instead .
christ be with you ! kutúzov repeated and went toward his carriage .
get in with me , said he to bolkónski .
your excellency , i should like to be of use here .
allow me to remain with prince bagratión s get in , said kutúzov , and noticing that bolkónski still delayed , he added i need good officers myself , need them myself ! they got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence .
there is still much , much before us , he said , as if with an old man s penetration he understood all that was passing in bolkónski s mind .
if a tenth part of his detachment returns i shall thank god , he added as if speaking to himself .
prince andrew glanced at kutúzov s face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple , where an ismail bullet had pierced his skull , and the empty eye socket .
yes , he has a right to speak so calmly of those men s death , thought bolkónski .
that is why i beg to be sent to that detachment , he said .
kutúzov did not reply .
he seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying , and sat plunged in thought .
five minutes later , gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage , he turned to prince andrew .
there was not a trace of agitation on his face .
with delicate irony he questioned prince andrew about the details of his interview with the emperor , about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the krems affair , and about some ladies they both knew .
on november kutúzov had received , through a spy , news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position .
the spy reported that the french , after crossing the bridge at vienna , were advancing in immense force upon kutúzov s line of communication with the troops that were arriving from russia .
if kutúzov decided to remain at krems , napoleon s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand , and he would find himself in the position of mack at ulm .
if kutúzov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from russia , he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the bohemian mountains , defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with buxhöwden .
if kutúzov decided to retreat along the road from krems to olmütz , to unite with the troops arriving from russia , he risked being forestalled on that road by the french who had crossed the vienna bridge , and encumbered by his baggage and transport , having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong , who would hem him in from two sides .
kutúzov chose this latter course .
the french , the spy reported , having crossed the vienna bridge , were advancing by forced marches toward znaim , which lay miles off on the line of kutúzov s retreat .
if he reached znaim before the french , there would be great hope of saving the army ; to let the french forestall him at znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of ulm , or to utter destruction .
but to forestall the french with his whole army was impossible .
the road for the french from vienna to znaim was shorter and better than the road for the russians from krems to znaim .
the night he received the news , kutúzov sent bagratión s vanguard , four thousand strong , to the right across the hills from the to the road .
bagratión was to make this march without resting , and to halt facing vienna with znaim to his rear , and if he succeeded in forestalling the french he was to delay them as long as possible .
kutúzov himself with all his transport took the road to znaim .
marching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills , with his hungry , soldiers , and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way , bagratión came out on the road at hollabrünn a few hours ahead of the french who were approaching hollabrünn from vienna .
kutúzov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach znaim .
hence bagratión with his four thousand hungry , exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at hollabrünn , which was clearly impossible .
but a freak of fate made the impossible possible .
the success of the trick that had placed the vienna bridge in the hands of the french without a fight led murat to try to deceive kutúzov in a similar way .
meeting bagratión s weak detachment on the znaim road he supposed it to be kutúzov s whole army .
to be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from vienna , and with this object offered a three days truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving .
murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding , and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed .
count nostitz , the austrian general occupying the advanced posts , believed murat s emissary and retired , leaving bagratión s division exposed .
another emissary rode to the russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the russian army the three days truce .
bagratión replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to kutúzov to report the offer he had received .
a truce was kutúzov s sole chance of gaining time , giving bagratión s exhausted troops some rest , and letting the transport and heavy convoys ( whose movements were concealed from the french ) advance if but one stage nearer znaim .
the offer of a truce gave the only , and a quite unexpected , chance of saving the army .
on receiving the news he immediately dispatched adjutant general wintzingerode , who was in attendance on him , to the enemy camp .
wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation , and meanwhile kutúzov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the road .
bagratión s exhausted and hungry detachment , which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army , had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself .
kutúzov s expectations that the proposals of capitulation ( which were in no way binding ) might give time for part of the transport to pass , and also that murat s mistake would very soon be discovered , proved correct .
as soon as bonaparte ( who was at schönbrunn , sixteen miles from hollabrünn ) received murat s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation , he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to murat schönbrunn , brumaire , , at eight o clock in the morning to , i can not find words to express to you my displeasure .
you command only my advance guard , and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order .
you are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign .
break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy .
inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so , and that no one but the emperor of russia has that right .
if , however , the emperor of russia ratifies that convention , i will ratify it ; but it is only a trick .
march on , destroy the russian army you are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery .
the russian emperor s is an impostor .
officers are nothing when they have no powers ; this one had none
the austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the vienna bridge , you are letting yourself be tricked by an of the emperor .
bonaparte s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to murat .
bonaparte himself , not trusting to his generals , moved with all the guards to the field of battle , afraid of letting a ready victim escape , and bagratión s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires , dried and warmed themselves , cooked their porridge for the first time for three days , and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him .
between three and four o clock in the afternoon prince andrew , who had persisted in his request to kutúzov , arrived at grunth and reported himself to bagratión .
bonaparte s adjutant had not yet reached murat s detachment and the battle had not yet begun .
in bagratión s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs .
they talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility ; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement .
bagratión , knowing bolkónski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant , received him with distinction and special marks of favor , explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next , and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat , which is also very however , there will hardly be an engagement today , said bagratión as if to reassure prince andrew .
if he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard , but if he wishes to stay with me , let him he ll be of use here if he s a brave officer , thought bagratión .
prince andrew , without replying , asked the prince s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces , so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order .
the officer on duty , a handsome , elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger , who was fond of speaking french though he spoke it badly , offered to conduct prince andrew .
on all sides they saw officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something , and soldiers dragging doors , benches , and fencing from the village .
there now , prince !
we can t stop those fellows , said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers .
the officers don t keep them in hand .
and there , he pointed to a sutler s tent , they crowd in and sit .
this morning i turned them all out and now look , it s full again .
i must go there , prince , and scare them a bit .
it won t take a yes , let s go in and i will get myself a roll and some cheese , said prince andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything .
why didn t you mention it , prince ?
i would have offered you they dismounted and entered the tent .
several officers , with flushed and weary faces , were sitting at the table eating and drinking .
now what does this mean , gentlemen ? said the staff officer , in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once .
you know it won t do to leave your posts like this .
the prince gave orders that no one should leave his post .
now you , captain , and he turned to a thin , dirty little artillery officer who without his boots ( he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry ) , in only his stockings , rose when they entered , smiling not altogether comfortably .
well , aren t you ashamed of yourself , captain túshin ? he continued .
one would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example , yet here you are without your boots !
the alarm will be sounded and you ll be in a pretty position without your boots ! ( the staff officer smiled . )
kindly return to your posts , gentlemen , all of you , all ! he added in a tone of command .
prince andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer túshin , who silent and smiling , shifting from one stockinged foot to the other , glanced inquiringly with his large , intelligent , kindly eyes from prince andrew to the staff officer .
the soldiers say it feels easier without boots , said captain túshin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position , evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone .
but before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off .
he grew confused .
kindly return to your posts , said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity .
prince andrew glanced again at the artillery officer s small figure .
there was something peculiar about it , quite unsoldierly , rather comic , but extremely attractive .
the staff officer and prince andrew mounted their horses and rode on .
having ridden beyond the village , continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments , they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up , the freshly dug clay of which showed up red .
several battalions of soldiers , in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind , swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants ; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands .
prince andrew and the officer rode up , looked at the entrenchment , and went on again .
just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers , continually replaced by others , who ran from the entrenchment .
they had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines .
voilà l agrément des camps , monsieur le prince , said the staff officer .
this is a pleasure one gets in camp , they rode up the opposite hill .
from there the french could already be seen .
prince andrew stopped and began examining the position .
that s our battery , said the staff officer indicating the highest point .
it s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots .
you can see everything from there ; let s go there , thank you very much , i will go on alone , said prince andrew , wishing to rid himself of this staff officer s company , please don t trouble yourself the staff officer remained behind and prince andrew rode on alone .
the farther forward and nearer the enemy he went , the more orderly and cheerful were the troops .
the greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the znaim road seven miles away from the french .
at grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt , but the nearer prince andrew came to the french lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops .
the soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines , the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men , poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up .
soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter ; around the fires sat others , dressed and undressed , drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers .
in one company dinner was ready , and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler , waiting till the sample , which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter , had been tasted .
another company , a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka , crowded round a pockmarked , sergeant major who , tilting a keg , filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him .
the soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces , emptied them , rolling the vodka in their mouths , and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions , licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats .
all their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment , and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field .
after passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the kiev fellows busy with similar peaceful the shelter of the regimental commander , higher than and different from the others , prince andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man .
two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back .
the man shrieked unnaturally .
a stout major was pacing up and down the line , and regardless of the screams kept repeating it s a shame for a soldier to steal ; a soldier must be honest , honorable , and brave , but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him , he s a scoundrel .
go on !
go on ! so the swishing sound of the strokes , and the desperate but unnatural screams , continued .
go on , go on ! said the major .
a young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by .
prince andrew , having reached the front line , rode along it .
our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks , but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning , the lines were so near together that the men could see one another s faces and speak to one another .
besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side , there were many curious onlookers who , jesting and laughing , stared at their strange foreign enemies .
since early an injunction not to approach the picket officers had been unable to keep away .
the soldiers forming the picket line , like showmen exhibiting a curiosity , no longer looked at the french but paid attention to the and grew weary waiting to be relieved .
prince andrew halted to have a look at the french .
look !
look there ! one soldier was saying to another , pointing to a russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a french grenadier .
hark to him jabbering !
fine , isn t it ?
it s all the frenchy can do to keep up with him .
there now , sídorov ! wait a bit and listen .
it s fine ! answered sídorov , who was considered an adept at french .
the soldier to whom the laughers referred was dólokhov .
prince andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying .
dólokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed , with his captain .
now then , go on , go on ! incited the officer , bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him .
more , please more !
what s he saying ? dólokhov did not answer the captain ; he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the french grenadier .
they were naturally talking about the campaign .
the frenchman , confusing the austrians with the russians , was trying to prove that the russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from ulm , while dólokhov maintained that the russians had not surrendered but had beaten the french .
we have orders to drive you off here , and we shall drive you off , said dólokhov .
only take care you and your cossacks are not all captured ! said the french grenadier .
the french onlookers and listeners laughed .
we ll make you dance as we did under suvórov , said dólokhov .
on vous fera qu qu il chante ? asked a frenchman .
what s he singing about ? it s ancient history , said another , guessing that it referred to a former war .
the emperor will teach your suvara as he has taught the others bonaparte began dólokhov , but the frenchman interrupted him .
not bonaparte .
he is the emperor !
sacré nom ! cried he angrily .
the devil skin your and dólokhov swore at him in coarse soldier s russian and shouldering his musket walked away .
let us go , iván lukích , he said to the captain .
ah , that s the way to talk french , said the picket soldiers .
now , sídorov , you have a try ! sídorov , turning to the french , winked , and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast kari , mala , tafa , safi , muter , kaská , he said , trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice .
ho !
ho !
ho !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ha !
ouh !
ouh ! came peals of such healthy and laughter from the soldiers that it infected the french involuntarily , so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets , explode the ammunition , and all return home as quickly as possible .
but the guns remained loaded , the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly , and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before .
having ridden round the whole line from right flank to left , prince andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen .
here he dismounted , and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon .
before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down ; he stood at attention when the officer arrived , but at a sign resumed his measured , monotonous pacing .
behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen s bonfires .
to the left , not far from the farthest cannon , was a small , newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers voices in eager conversation .
it was true that a view over nearly the whole russian position and the greater part of the enemy s opened out from this battery .
just facing it , on the crest of the opposite hill , the village of schön grabern could be seen , and in three places to left and right the french troops amid the smoke of their campfires , the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill .
to the left from that village , amid the smoke , was something resembling a battery , but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye .
our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the french position .
our infantry were stationed there , and at the farthest point the dragoons .
in the center , where túshin s battery stood and from which prince andrew was surveying the position , was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from schön grabern .
on the left our troops were close to a copse , in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood .
the french line was wider than ours , and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides .
behind our position was a steep and deep dip , making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire .
prince andrew took out his notebook and , leaning on the cannon , sketched a plan of the position .
he made some notes on two points , intending to mention them to bagratión .
his idea was , first , to concentrate all the artillery in the center , and secondly , to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip .
prince andrew , being always near the commander in chief , closely following the mass movements and general orders , and constantly studying historical accounts of battles , involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline .
he imagined only important possibilities if the enemy attacks the right flank , he said to himself , the kiev grenadiers and the podólsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up .
in that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack .
if they attack our center we , having the center battery on this high ground , shall withdraw the left flank under its cover , and retreat to the dip by so he reasoned all the time he had been beside the gun , he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly , but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying .
suddenly , however , he was struck by a voice coming from the shed , and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen .
no , friend , said a pleasant and , as it seemed to prince andrew , a familiar voice , what i say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death , none of us would be afraid of it .
that s so , another , a younger voice , interrupted him afraid or not , you can t escape it all the same , one is afraid !
oh , you clever people , said a third manly voice interrupting them both .
of course you artillery men are very wise , because you can take everything along with and and the owner of the manly voice , evidently an infantry officer , laughed .
yes , one is afraid , continued the first speaker , he of the familiar voice .
one is afraid of the unknown , that s what it is .
whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky we know there is no sky but only an the manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer .
well , stand us some of your herb vodka , túshin , it said .
why , thought prince andrew , that s the captain who stood up in the sutler s hut without his he recognized the agreeable , philosophizing voice with pleasure .
some herb vodka ?
certainly ! said túshin .
but still , to conceive a future life he did not finish .
just then there was a whistle in the air ; nearer and nearer , faster and louder , louder and faster , a cannon ball , as if it had not finished saying what was necessary , thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force , throwing up a mass of earth .
the ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact .
and immediately túshin , with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind , intelligent face rather pale , rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice , a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company , buttoning up his coat as he ran .
mounting his horse again prince andrew lingered with the battery , looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball .
his eyes ran rapidly over the wide space , but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the french now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left .
the smoke above it had not yet dispersed .
two mounted frenchmen , probably adjutants , were galloping up the hill .
a small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill , probably to strengthen the front line .
the smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared , followed by a report .
the battle had begun !
prince andrew turned his horse and galloped back to grunth to find prince bagratión .
he heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent .
evidently our guns had begun to reply .
from the bottom of the slope , where the parleys had taken place , came the report of musketry .
lemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with bonaparte s stern letter , and murat , humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault , had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the russian wings , hoping before evening and before the arrival of the emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him .
it has begun .
here it is ! thought prince andrew , feeling the blood rush to his heart .
but where and how will my toulon present itself ? passing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before , he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready , and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart .
it has begun !
here it is , dreadful but enjoyable ! was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say .
before he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up , he saw , in the light of the dull autumn evening , mounted men coming toward him .
the foremost , wearing a cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse , was prince bagratión .
prince andrew stopped , waiting for him to come up ; prince bagratión reined in his horse and recognizing prince andrew nodded to him .
he still looked ahead while prince andrew told him what he had seen .
the feeling , it has begun !
here it is ! was seen even on prince bagratión s hard brown face with its , dull , sleepy eyes .
prince andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what , if anything , this man was thinking and feeling at that moment .
is there anything at all behind that impassive face ? prince andrew asked himself as he looked .
prince bagratión bent his head in sign of agreement with what prince andrew told him , and said , very good ! in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen .
prince andrew , out of breath with his rapid ride , spoke quickly .
prince bagratión , uttering his words with an oriental accent , spoke particularly slowly , as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry .
however , he put his horse to a trot in the direction of túshin s battery .
prince andrew followed with the suite .
behind prince bagratión rode an officer of the suite , the prince s personal adjutant , zherkóv , an orderly officer , the staff officer on duty , riding a fine bobtailed horse , and a accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity .
the accountant , a stout , man , looked around him with a naïve smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars , cossacks , and adjutants , in his camlet coat , as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer s saddle .
he wants to see a battle , said zherkóv to bolkónski , pointing to the accountant , but he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach oh , leave off ! said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile , as if flattered at being made the subject of zherkóv s joke , and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was .
it is very strange , mon monsieur prince , said the staff officer .
( he remembered that in french there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince , but could not get it quite right . )
by this time they were all approaching túshin s battery , and a ball struck the ground in front of them .
what s that that has fallen ? asked the accountant with a naïve smile .
a french pancake , answered zherkóv .
so that s what they hit with ? asked the accountant .
how awful ! he seemed to swell with satisfaction .
he had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft !
and a cossack , riding a little to their right and behind the accountant , crashed to earth with his horse .
zherkóv and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away .
the accountant stopped , facing the cossack , and examined him with attentive curiosity .
the cossack was dead , but the horse still struggled .
prince bagratión screwed up his eyes , looked round , and , seeing the cause of the confusion , turned away with indifference , as if to say , is it worth while noticing trifles ? he reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and , slightly bending over , disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak .
it was an saber of a kind no longer in general use .
prince andrew remembered the story of suvórov giving his saber to bagratión in italy , and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment .
they had reached the battery at which prince andrew had been when he examined the battlefield .
whose company ? asked prince bagratión of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon .
he asked , whose company ? but he really meant , are you frightened here ? and the artilleryman understood him .
captain túshin s , your excellency ! shouted the , freckled gunner in a merry voice , standing to attention .
yes , yes , muttered bagratión as if considering something , and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon .
as he approached , a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite , and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position .
a huge , gunner , number one , holding a mop , his legs far apart , sprang to the wheel ; while number two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon s mouth .
the short , captain túshin , stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage , moved forward and , not noticing the general , looked out shading his eyes with his small hand .
lift it two lines more and it will be just right , cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note , to his weak figure .
number two ! he squeaked .
fire , medvédev ! bagratión called to him , and túshin , raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest s benediction , approached the general .
though túshin s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley , he was firing incendiary balls at the village of schön grabern visible just opposite , in front of which large masses of french were advancing .
no one had given túshin orders where and at what to fire , but after consulting his sergeant major , zakharchénko , for whom he had great respect , he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village .
very good ! said bagratión in reply to the officer s report , and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him .
the french had advanced nearest on our right .
below the height on which the kiev regiment was stationed , in the hollow where the rivulet flowed , the rolling and crackling of musketry was heard , and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons , the officer of the suite pointed out to bagratión a french column that was outflanking us .
to the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood .
prince bagratión ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank .
the officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away , the guns would remain without support .
prince bagratión turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence .
it seemed to prince andrew that the officer s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it .
but at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the french were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the kiev grenadiers .
prince bagratión bowed his head in sign of assent and approval .
he rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the french .
but this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground , as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly , and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood .
very good ! said bagratión .
as he was leaving the battery , firing was heard on the left also , and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself , prince bagratión sent zherkóv to tell the general in command ( the one who had paraded his regiment before kutúzov at braunau ) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear , as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy s attack very long .
about túshin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten .
prince andrew listened attentively to bagratión s colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and , to his surprise , found that no orders were really given , but that prince bagratión tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity , by accident , or by the will of subordinate commanders was done , if not by his direct command , at least in accord with his intentions .
prince andrew noticed , however , that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander s will , owing to the tact bagratión showed , his presence was very valuable .
officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm ; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily , grew more cheerful in his presence , and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him .
prince bagratión , having reached the highest point of our right flank , began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen .
the nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield .
they began to meet wounded men .
one with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms .
there was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood .
a bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth .
another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket , groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt , while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle .
he had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering .
crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground ; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded .
the soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily , and despite the general s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating .
in front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke , and an officer catching sight of bagratión rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers , ordering them back .
bagratión rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there , drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command .
the whole air reeked with smoke .
the excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it .
some were using their ramrods , others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches , while others were firing , though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away .
a pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard .
what is this ? thought prince andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers .
it can t be an attack , for they are not moving ; it can t be a they are not drawn up for the commander of the regiment , a thin , old man with a pleasant eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes , giving him a mild expression , rode up to bagratión and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest .
he reported that his regiment had been attacked by french cavalry and that , though the attack had been repulsed , he had lost more than half his men .
he said the attack had been repulsed , employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment , but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that to the troops entrusted to him , and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up .
all he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted cavalry ! and our men had begun firing .
they were still firing , not at the cavalry which had disappeared , but at french infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men .
prince bagratión bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected .
turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the sixth chasseurs whom they had just passed .
prince andrew was struck by the changed expression on prince bagratión s face at this moment .
it expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water .
the dull , sleepy expression was no longer there , nor the affectation of profound thought .
the round , steady , hawk s eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully , not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured .
the commander of the regiment turned to prince bagratión , entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were .
please , your excellency , for god s sake ! he kept saying , glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him .
there , you see ! and he drew attention to the bullets whistling , singing , and hissing continually around them .
he spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax we are used to it , but you , sir , will blister your he spoke as if those bullets could not kill him , and his eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words .
the staff officer joined in the colonel s appeals , but bagratión did not reply ; he only gave an order to cease firing and , so as to give room for the two approaching battalions .
while he was speaking , the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow , driven by a rising wind , began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand , and the hill opposite , with the french moving about on it , opened out before them .
all eyes fastened involuntarily on this french column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground .
one could already see the soldiers shaggy caps , distinguish the officers from the men , and see the standard flapping against its staff .
they march splendidly , remarked someone in bagratión s suite .
the head of the column had already descended into the hollow .
the clash would take place on this side of it
the remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right ; from behind it , dispersing the laggards , came two battalions of the sixth chasseurs in fine order .
before they had reached bagratión , the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard .
on their left flank , nearest to bagratión , marched a company commander , a fine man , with a stupid and happy same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed .
at that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander .
with the of a man on parade , he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along , stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort , his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him .
he carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword ( small , curved , and not like a real weapon ) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step , his whole powerful body turning flexibly .
it was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner , and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy .
left left left he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step ; and in time to this , with stern but varied faces , the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step , and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step , left left left a fat major skirted a bush , puffing and falling out of step ; a soldier who had fallen behind , his face showing alarm at his defection , ran at a trot , panting to catch up with his company .
a cannon ball , cleaving the air , flew over the heads of bagratión and his suite , and fell into the column to the measure of left left ! close up ! came the company commander s voice in jaunty tones .
the soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen , and an old trooper on the flank , a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men , ran to catch up his line and , falling into step with a hop , looked back angrily , and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison , one seemed to hear left left left .
well done , lads ! said prince bagratión .
glad to do our best , your ex ! came a confused shout from the ranks .
a morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on bagratión as he shouted , with an expression that seemed to say we know that ourselves ! another , without looking round , as though fearing to relax , shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on .
the order was given to halt and down knapsacks .
bagratión rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted .
he gave the reins to a cossack , took off and handed over his felt coat , stretched his legs , and set his cap straight .
the head of the french column , with its officers leading , appeared from below the hill .
forward , with god ! said bagratión , in a resolute , sonorous voice , turning for a moment to the front line , and slightly swinging his arms , he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman .
prince andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward , and experienced great happiness .
the french were already near .
prince andrew , walking beside bagratión , could clearly distinguish their bandoliers , red epaulets , and even their faces .
( he distinctly saw an old french officer who , with gaitered legs and toes , climbed the hill with difficulty . )
prince bagratión gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks .
suddenly one shot after another rang out from the french , smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks , and musket shots sounded .
several of our men fell , among them the officer who had marched so gaily and complacently .
but at the moment the first report was heard , bagratión looked round and shouted , hurrah ! ! ! rang a shout from our ranks , and passing bagratión and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe .
the attack of the sixth chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank .
in the center túshin s forgotten battery , which had managed to set fire to the schön grabern village , delayed the french advance .
the french were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading , and thus gave us time to retreat .
the retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy , but the different companies did not get mixed .
but our consisted of the azóv and podólsk infantry and the pávlograd simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior french forces under lannes and was thrown into confusion .
bagratión had sent zherkóv to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately .
zherkóv , not removing his hand from his cap , turned his horse about and galloped off .
but no sooner had he left bagratión than his courage failed him .
he was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous .
having reached the left flank , instead of going to the front where the firing was , he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be , and so did not deliver the order .
the command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment kutúzov had reviewed at braunau and in which dólokhov was serving as a private .
but the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the pávlograd regiment in which rostóv was serving , and a misunderstanding arose .
the two commanders were much exasperated with one another and , long after the action had begun on the right flank and the french were already advancing , were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another .
but the regiments , both cavalry and infantry , were by no means ready for the impending action .
from privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations , the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood .
he higher iss dan i in rank , said the german colonel of the hussars , flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up , so let him do what he vill , but i can not sacrifice my hussars bugler , sount ze retreat ! but haste was becoming imperative .
cannon and musketry , mingling together , thundered on the right and in the center , while the capotes of lannes sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot .
the general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps , and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the pávlograd commander .
the commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts .
once again , colonel , said the general , i can t leave half my men in the wood .
i beg of you , i beg of you , he repeated , to occupy the position and prepare for an i peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business ! suddenly replied the irate colonel .
if you vere in the cavalry i am not in the cavalry , colonel , but i am a russian general and if you are not aware of the fact quite avare , your excellency , suddenly shouted the colonel , touching his horse and turning purple in the face .
vill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot ?
i don t vish to destroy my men for your pleasure ! you forget yourself , colonel .
i am not considering my own pleasure and i won t allow it to be said ! taking the colonel s outburst as a challenge to his courage , the general expanded his chest and rode , frowning , beside him to the front line , as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets .
they reached the front , several bullets sped over them , and they halted in silence .
there was nothing fresh to be seen from the line , for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground , as well as that the french were outflanking our left .
the general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle , each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other .
both passed the examination successfully .
as there was nothing to be said , and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire , they would have remained there for a long time testing each other s courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood .
the french had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse .
it was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry .
they were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the french .
however inconvenient the position , it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves .
the squadron in which rostóv was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy .
again , as at the enns bridge , there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy , and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and the line separating the living from the between them .
all were conscious of this unseen line , and the question whether they would cross it or not , and how they would cross it , agitated them all .
the colonel rode to the front , angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers , and , like a man desperately insisting on having his own way , gave an order .
no one said anything definite , but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron .
the command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards .
still no one moved .
the troops of the left flank , infantry and hussars alike , felt that the commander did not himself know what to do , and this irresolution communicated itself to the men .
if only they would be quick ! thought rostóv , feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars .
fo ward , with god , lads ! rang out denísov s voice .
at a twot fo ward ! the horses croups began to sway in the front line .
rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord .
before him , on the right , rostóv saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy .
shots could be heard , but some way off .
faster ! came the word of command , and rostóv felt rook s flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop .
rostóv anticipated his horse s movements and became more and more elated .
he had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him .
this tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible , but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated .
oh , how i will slash at him ! thought rostóv , gripping the hilt of his saber .
! came a roar of voices .
let anyone come my way now , thought rostóv driving his spurs into rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others .
ahead , the enemy was already visible .
suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron .
rostóv raised his saber , ready to strike , but at that instant the trooper nikítenko , who was galloping ahead , shot away from him , and rostóv felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot .
from behind him bondarchúk , an hussar he knew , jolted against him and looked angrily at him .
bondarchúk s horse swerved and galloped past .
how is it i am not moving ?
i have fallen , i am killed ! rostóv asked and answered at the same instant .
he was alone in the middle of a field .
instead of the moving horses and hussars backs , he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him .
there was warm blood under his arm .
no , i am wounded and the horse is rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back , pinning his rider s leg .
blood was flowing from his head ; he struggled but could not rise .
rostóv also tried to rise but fell back , his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle .
where our men were , and where the french , he did not know .
there was no one near .
having disentangled his leg , he rose .
where , on which side , was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies ? he asked himself and could not answer .
can something bad have happened to me ? he wondered as he got up and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm .
the wrist felt as if it were not his .
he examined his hand carefully , vainly trying to find blood on it .
ah , here are people coming , he thought joyfully , seeing some men running toward him .
they will help me ! in front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak , swarthy , sunburned , and with a hooked nose .
then came two more , and many more running behind .
one of them said something strange , not in russian .
in among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a russian hussar .
he was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him .
it must be one of ours , a prisoner .
yes .
can it be that they will take me too ?
who are these men ? thought rostóv , scarcely believing his eyes .
can they be french ? he looked at the approaching frenchmen , and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces , their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes .
who are they ?
why are they running ?
can they be coming at me ?
and why ?
to kill me ?
me whom everyone is so fond of ? he remembered his mother s love for him , and his family s , and his friends , and the enemy s intention to kill him seemed impossible .
but perhaps they may do it ! for more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation .
the foremost frenchman , the one with the hooked nose , was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen .
and the excited , alien face of that man , his bayonet hanging down , holding his breath , and running so lightly , frightened rostóv .
he seized his pistol and , instead of firing it , flung it at the frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes .
he did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the enns bridge , but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds .
one single sentiment , that of fear for his young and happy life , possessed his whole being .
rapidly leaping the furrows , he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay , now and then turning his , pale , young face to look back .
a shudder of terror went through him no , better not look , he thought , but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more .
the french had fallen behind , and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and , turning , shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back .
rostóv paused .
no , there s some mistake , thought he .
they can t have wanted to kill but at the same time , his left arm felt as heavy as if a weight were tied to it .
he could run no more .
the frenchman also stopped and took aim .
rostóv closed his eyes and stooped down .
one bullet and then another whistled past him .
he mustered his last remaining strength , took hold of his left hand with his right , and reached the bushes .
behind these were some russian sharpshooters .
the infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it , the different companies getting mixed , and retreated as a disorderly crowd .
one soldier , in his fear , uttered the senseless cry , cut off ! that is so terrible in battle , and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic .
surrounded !
cut off ?
we re lost ! shouted the fugitives .
the moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind , the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment , and the thought that he , an exemplary officer of many years service who had never been to blame , might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that , forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel , his own dignity as a general , and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for , he clutched the crupper of his saddle and , spurring his horse , galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around , but fortunately missed him .
his one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct , or remedy , the mistake if he had made one , so that he , an exemplary officer of years service , who had never been censured , should not be held to blame .
having galloped safely through the french , he reached a field behind the copse across which our men , regardless of orders , were running and descending the valley .
that moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived .
would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander , or would they , disregarding him , continue their flight ?
despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers , despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self , and the flourishing of his saber , the soldiers all continued to run , talking , firing into the air , and disobeying orders .
the moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic .
the general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair .
everything seemed lost .
but at that moment the french who were attacking , suddenly and without any apparent reason , ran back and disappeared from the outskirts , and russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse .
it was timókhin s company , which alone had maintained its order in the wood and , having lain in ambush in a ditch , now attacked the french unexpectedly .
timókhin , armed only with a sword , had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad , drunken determination that , taken by surprise , the french had thrown down their muskets and run .
dólokhov , running beside timókhin , killed a frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering french officer by his collar .
our fugitives returned , the battalions , and the french who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed .
our reserve units were able to join up , and the fight was at an end .
the regimental commander and major ekonómov had stopped beside a bridge , letting the retreating companies pass by them , when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander s stirrup , almost leaning against him .
the man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth , he had no knapsack or cap , his head was bandaged , and over his shoulder a french munition pouch was slung .
he had an officer s sword in his hand .
the soldier was pale , his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander s face , and his lips were smiling .
though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to major ekonómov , he could not help taking notice of the soldier .
your excellency , here are two trophies , said dólokhov , pointing to the french sword and pouch .
i have taken an officer prisoner .
i stopped the dólokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences .
the whole company can bear witness .
i beg you will remember this , your excellency ! all right , all right , replied the commander , and turned to major ekonómov .
but dólokhov did not go away ; he untied the handkerchief around his head , pulled it off , and showed the blood congealed on his hair .
a bayonet wound .
i remained at the front .
remember , your excellency ! túshin s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did prince bagratión , still hearing the cannonade in the center , send his orderly staff officer , and later prince andrew also , to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible .
when the supports attached to túshin s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone s order , the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the french because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns .
on the contrary , the energetic action of that battery led the french to suppose that the main russian forces were concentrated .
twice they had attempted to attack this point , but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock .
soon after prince bagratión had left him , túshin had succeeded in setting fire to schön grabern .
look at them scurrying !
it s burning !
just see the smoke !
fine !
grand !
look at the smoke , the smoke ! exclaimed the artillerymen , brightening up .
all the guns , without waiting for orders , were being fired in the direction of the conflagration .
as if urging each other on , the soldiers cried at each shot fine !
that s good !
look at it grand ! the fire , fanned by the breeze , was rapidly spreading .
the french columns that had advanced beyond the village went back ; but as though in revenge for this failure , the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at túshin s battery .
in their childlike glee , aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the french , our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls , and then four more , fell among our guns , one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a driver s leg .
their spirits once roused were , however , not diminished , but only changed character .
the horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage , the wounded were carried away , and the four guns were turned against the battery .
túshin s companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns crews had been disabled , but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever .
twice they noticed the french appearing below them , and then they fired grapeshot at them .
little túshin , moving feebly and awkwardly , kept telling his orderly to refill my pipe for that one ! and then , scattering sparks from it , ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the french .
smack at em , lads ! he kept saying , seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself .
amid the smoke , deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump , túshin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun , now aiming , now counting the charges , now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones , and shouting in his feeble voice , so high pitched and irresolute .
his face grew more and more animated .
only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight , shouting angrily at the men who , as is always the case , hesitated about lifting the injured or dead .
the soldiers , for the most part handsome fellows and , as is always the case in an artillery company , a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation , and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs .
owing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity , túshin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear , and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him .
on the contrary , he became more and more elated .
it seemed to him that it was a very long time ago , almost a day , since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot , and that the corner of the field he stood on was and familiar ground .
though he thought of everything , considered everything , and did everything the best of officers could do in his position , he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness .
from the deafening sounds of his own guns around him , the whistle and thud of the enemy s cannon balls , from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns , from the sight of the blood of men and horses , from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy s side ( always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth , a man , a gun , a horse ) , from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure .
the enemy s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker .
there he s puffing again , muttered túshin to himself , as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind .
now look out for the ball we ll throw it what do you want , your honor ? asked an artilleryman , standing close by , who heard him muttering .
nothing only a shell he answered .
come along , our matvévna ! he said to himself .
matvévna was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery , which was large and of an old pattern .
the french swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants .
in that world , the handsome drunkard number one of the second gun s crew was uncle ; túshin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement .
the sound of musketry at the foot of the hill , now diminishing , now increasing , seemed like someone s breathing .
he listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds .
daughter of matthew .
ah !
breathing again , breathing ! he muttered to himself .
he imagined himself as an enormously tall , powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the french with both hands .
now then , matvévna , dear old lady , don t let me down ! he was saying as he moved from the gun , when a strange , unfamiliar voice called above his head captain túshin !
captain ! túshin turned round in dismay .
it was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at grunth .
he was shouting in a gasping voice are you mad ?
you have twice been ordered to retreat , and you why are they down on me ? thought túshin , looking in alarm at his superior .
i don t he muttered , holding up two fingers to his cap .
i but the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say .
a cannon ball , flying close to him , caused him to duck and bend over his horse .
he paused , and just as he was about to say something more , another ball stopped him .
he turned his horse and galloped off .
retire !
all to retire ! he shouted from a distance .
the soldiers laughed .
a moment later , an adjutant arrived with the same order .
it was prince andrew .
the first thing he saw on riding up to the space where túshin s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg , that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses .
blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring .
among the limbers lay several dead men .
one ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine .
but the mere thought of being afraid roused him again .
i can not be afraid , thought he , and dismounted slowly among the guns .
he delivered the order and did not leave the battery .
he decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence .
together with túshin , stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the french , he attended to the removal of the guns .
a staff officer was here a minute ago , but skipped off , said an artilleryman to prince andrew .
not like your honor ! prince andrew said nothing to túshin .
they were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another .
when having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four , they began moving down the hill ( one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind ) , prince andrew rode up to túshin .
well , till we meet again he said , holding out his hand to túshin .
, my dear fellow , said túshin .
dear soul !
, my dear fellow ! and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes .
the wind had fallen and black clouds , merging with the powder smoke , hung low over the field of battle on the horizon .
it was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous .
the cannonade was dying down , but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer .
as soon as túshin with his guns , continually driving round or coming upon wounded men , was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip , he was met by some of the staff , among them the staff officer and zherkóv , who had been twice sent to túshin s battery but had never reached it .
interrupting one another , they all gave , and transmitted , orders as to how to proceed , reprimanding and reproaching him .
túshin gave no orders , and , to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing behind on his artillery nag .
though the orders were to abandon the wounded , many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages .
the jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of túshin s wattle shed was laid , with a bullet in his stomach , on matvévna s carriage .
at the foot of the hill , a pale hussar cadet , supporting one hand with the other , came up to túshin and asked for a seat .
captain , for god s sake !
i ve hurt my arm , he said timidly .
for god s sake
i can t walk .
for god s sake ! it was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused .
he asked in a hesitating , piteous voice .
tell them to give me a seat , for god s sake ! give him a seat , said túshin .
lay a cloak for him to sit on , lad , he said , addressing his favorite soldier .
and where is the wounded officer ? he has been set down .
he died , replied someone .
help him up .
sit down , dear fellow , sit down !
spread out the cloak , the cadet was rostóv .
with one hand he supported the other ; he was pale and his jaw trembled , shivering feverishly .
he was placed on matvévna , the gun from which they had removed the dead officer .
the cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm .
what , are you wounded , my lad ? said túshin , approaching the gun on which rostóv sat .
no , it s a then what is this blood on the gun carriage ? inquired túshin .
it was the officer , your honor , stained it , answered the artilleryman , wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve , as if apologizing for the state of his gun .
it was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry , and having reached the village of gruntersdorf they halted .
it had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off , and the firing had begun to subside .
suddenly , near by on the right , shouting and firing were again heard .
flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness .
this was the last french attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses .
they all rushed out of the village again , but túshin s guns could not move , and the artillerymen , túshin , and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate .
the firing died down and soldiers , talking eagerly , streamed out of a side street .
not hurt , petróv ? asked one .
we ve given it em hot , mate !
they won t make another push now , said another .
you couldn t see a thing .
how they shot at their own fellows !
nothing could be seen .
, brother !
isn t there something to drink ? the french had been repulsed for the last time .
and again and again in the complete darkness túshin s guns moved forward , surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame .
in the darkness , it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction , humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels .
amid the general rumble , the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night .
the gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans , which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night .
after a while the moving mass became agitated , someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite , and said something in passing what did he say ?
where to , now ?
halt , is it ?
did he thank us ? came eager questions from all sides .
the whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt evidently those in front had halted .
all remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road .
fires were lighted and the talk became more audible .
captain túshin , having given orders to his company , sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet , and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road .
rostóv , too , dragged himself to the fire .
from pain , cold , and damp , a feverish shivering shook his whole body .
drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him , but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm , for which he could find no satisfactory position .
he kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire , which seemed to him dazzlingly red , and at the feeble , figure of túshin who was sitting like a turk beside him .
túshin s large , kind , intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on rostóv , who saw that túshin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not .
from all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry , who were walking , driving past , and settling down all around .
the sound of voices , the tramping feet , the horses hoofs moving in mud , the crackling of wood fires near and afar , merged into one tremulous rumble .
it was no longer , as before , a dark , unseen river flowing through the gloom , but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm .
rostóv looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him .
an infantryman came to the fire , squatted on his heels , held his hands to the blaze , and turned away his face .
you don t mind your honor ? he asked túshin .
i ve lost my company , your honor .
i don t know where such bad luck ! with the soldier , an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire , and addressing túshin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past .
after he had gone , two soldiers rushed to the campfire .
they were quarreling and fighting desperately , each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to .
you picked it up ?
i dare say !
you re very smart ! one of them shouted hoarsely .
then a thin , pale soldier , his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band , came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water .
must one die like a dog ? said he .
túshin told them to give the man some water .
then a cheerful soldier ran up , begging a little fire for the infantry .
a nice little hot torch for the infantry !
good luck to you , fellow countrymen .
thanks for the ll return it with interest , said he , carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick .
next came four soldiers , carrying something heavy on a cloak , and passed by the fire .
one of them stumbled .
who the devil has put the logs on the road ? snarled he .
he s carry him ? said another .
shut up ! and they disappeared into the darkness with their load .
still aching ? túshin asked rostóv in a whisper .
your honor , you re wanted by the general .
he is in the hut here , said a gunner , coming up to túshin .
coming , túshin rose and , buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight , walked away from the fire .
not far from the artillery campfire , in a hut that had been prepared for him , prince bagratión sat at dinner , talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters .
the little old man with the eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone , and the general who had served blamelessly for years , flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner ; and the staff officer with the signet ring , and zherkóv , uneasily glancing at them all , and prince andrew , pale , with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes .
in a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the french , and the accountant with the naïve face was feeling its texture , shaking his head in because the banner really interested him , perhaps because it was hard for him , hungry as he was , to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him .
in the next hut there was a french colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons .
our officers were flocking in to look at him .
prince bagratión was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses .
the general whose regiment had been inspected at braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood , mustered the men who were woodcutting , and , allowing the french to pass him , had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the french troops .
when i saw , your excellency , that their first battalion was disorganized , i stopped in the road and thought i ll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion that s what i the general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened .
perhaps it might really have been so ?
could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen ?
by the way , your excellency , i should inform you , he dólokhov s conversation with kutúzov and his last interview with the that private dólokhov , who was reduced to the ranks , took a french officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished i saw the pávlograd hussars attack there , your excellency , chimed in zherkóv , looking uneasily around .
he had not seen the hussars all that day , but had heard about them from an infantry officer .
they broke up two squares , your several of those present smiled at zherkóv s words , expecting one of his usual jokes , but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day s work , they assumed a serious expression , though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation .
prince bagratión turned to the old colonel gentlemen , i thank you all ; all arms have behaved heroically infantry , cavalry , and artillery .
how was it that two guns were abandoned in the center ? he inquired , searching with his eyes for someone .
( prince bagratión did not ask about the guns on the left flank ; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action . )
i think i sent you ? he added , turning to the staff officer on duty .
one was damaged , answered the staff officer , and the other i can t understand .
i was there all the time giving orders and had only just left
it is true that it was hot there , he added , modestly .
someone mentioned that captain túshin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for .
oh , but you were there ? said prince bagratión , addressing prince andrew .
of course , we only just missed one another , said the staff officer , with a smile to bolkónski .
i had not the pleasure of seeing you , said prince andrew , coldly and abruptly .
all were silent .
túshin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals .
as he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut , feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors , he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it .
several of those present laughed .
how was it a gun was abandoned ? asked bagratión , frowning , not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing , among whom zherkóv laughed loudest .
only now , when he was confronted by the stern authorities , did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to túshin in all their horror .
he had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment .
the officers laughter confused him still more .
he stood before bagratión with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter i don t know your excellency
i had no men your you might have taken some from the covering túshin did not say that there were no covering troops , though that was perfectly true .
he was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble , and silently fixed his eyes on bagratión as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner .
the silence lasted some time .
prince bagratión , apparently not wishing to be severe , found nothing to say ; the others did not venture to intervene .
prince andrew looked at túshin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously .
your excellency ! prince andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice , you were pleased to send me to captain túshin s battery .
i went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out , two guns smashed , and no supports at prince bagratión and túshin looked with equal intentness at bolkónski , who spoke with suppressed agitation .
and , if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion , he continued , we owe today s success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of captain túshin and his company , and without awaiting a reply , prince andrew rose and left the table .
prince bagratión looked at túshin , evidently reluctant to show distrust in bolkónski s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it , bent his head , and told túshin that he could go .
prince andrew went out with him .
thank you ; you saved me , my dear fellow ! said túshin .
prince andrew gave him a look , but said nothing and went away .
he felt sad and depressed .
it was all so strange , so unlike what he had hoped .
who are they ?
why are they here ?
what do they want ?
and when will all this end ? thought rostóv , looking at the changing shadows before him .
the pain in his arm became more and more intense .
irresistible drowsiness overpowered him , red rings danced before his eyes , and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain .
it was they , these and was they who were crushing , weighing down , and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder .
to rid himself of them he closed his eyes .
for a moment he dozed , but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream his mother and her large white hand , sónya s thin little shoulders , natásha s eyes and laughter , denísov with his voice and mustache , and telyánin and all that affair with telyánin and bogdánich .
that affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice , and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly , incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction .
he tried to get away from them , but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair s breadth .
it would not would be only they did not pull it , but it was impossible to get rid of them .
he opened his eyes and looked up .
the black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal .
flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light .
túshin had not returned , the doctor had not come .
he was alone now , except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire , warming his thin yellow body .
nobody wants me ! thought rostóv .
there is no one to help me or pity me .
yet i was once at home , strong , happy , and he sighed and , doing so , groaned involuntarily .
eh , is anything hurting you ? asked the soldier , shaking his shirt out over the fire , and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added what a lot of men have been crippled ! rostóv did not listen to the soldier .
he looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a russian winter at his warm , bright home , his fluffy fur coat , his quickly gliding sleigh , his healthy body , and all the affection and care of his family .
and why did i come here ? he wondered .
next day the french army did not renew their attack , and the remnant of bagratión s detachment was reunited to kutúzov s army .
prince vasíli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans .
still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage .
he was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit .
schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself , but which formed the whole interest of his life , were constantly shaping themselves in his mind , arising from the circumstances and persons he met .
of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens , some only beginning to form themselves , some approaching achievement , and some in course of disintegration .
he did not , for instance , say to himself this man now has influence , i must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special nor did he say to himself pierre is a rich man , i must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles i but when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful , and without any premeditation prince vasíli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence , flatter him , become intimate with him , and finally make his request .
he had pierre at hand in moscow and procured for him an appointment as gentleman of the bedchamber , which at that time conferred the status of councilor of state , and insisted on the young man accompanying him to petersburg and staying at his house .
with apparent , yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing , prince vasíli did everything to get pierre to marry his daughter .
had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing .
something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people .
pierre , on unexpectedly becoming count bezúkhov and a rich man , felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself .
he had to sign papers , to present himself at government offices , the purpose of which was not clear to him , to question his chief steward , to visit his estate near moscow , and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them .
these different , relations , and acquaintances all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner they were all evidently firmly convinced of pierre s noble qualities .
he was always hearing such words as with your remarkable kindness , or , with your excellent heart , you are yourself so honorable , count , or , were he as clever as you , and so on , till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence , the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent .
even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate .
the angry eldest princess , with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll s , had come into pierre s room after the funeral .
with drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything , except only for permission , after the blow she had received , to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much .
she could not refrain from weeping at these words .
touched that this statuesque princess could so change , pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness , without knowing what for .
from that day the eldest princess quite changed toward pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him .
do this for my sake , mon cher ; after all , she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased , said prince vasíli to him , handing him a deed to sign for the princess benefit .
prince vasíli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bill for thirty thousand the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio .
pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder .
the younger sisters also became affectionate to him , especially the youngest , the pretty one with the mole , who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him .
it seemed so natural to pierre that everyone should like him , and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him , that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him .
besides , he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not .
he was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication .
he felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement ; that something was constantly expected of him , that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people , but if he did this and that , all would be well ; and he did what was demanded of him , but still that happy result always remained in the future .
more than anyone else , prince vasíli took possession of pierre s affairs and of pierre himself in those early days .
from the death of count bezúkhov he did not let go his hold of the lad .
he had the air of a man oppressed by business , weary and suffering , who yet would not , for pity s sake , leave this helpless youth who , after all , was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth , to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues .
during the few days he spent in moscow after the death of count bezúkhov , he would call pierre , or go to him himself , and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance , as if he were adding every time you know i am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that i trouble myself about you , and you also know quite well that what i propose is the only thing well , my dear fellow , tomorrow we are off at last , said prince vasíli one day , closing his eyes and fingering pierre s elbow , speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered .
we start tomorrow and i m giving you a place in my carriage .
i am very glad .
all our important business here is now settled , and i ought to have been off long ago .
here is something i have received from the chancellor .
i asked him for you , and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a gentleman of the bedchamber .
the diplomatic career now lies open before notwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced , pierre , who had so long been considering his career , wished to make some suggestion .
but prince vasíli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone , precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech , which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed .
mais , mon cher , i did this for my own sake , to satisfy my conscience , and there is nothing to thank me for .
no one has ever complained yet of being too much loved ; and besides , you are free , you could throw it up tomorrow .
but you will see everything for yourself when you get to petersburg .
it is high time for you to get away from these terrible prince vasíli sighed .
yes , yes , my boy .
and my valet can go in your carriage .
ah !
i was nearly forgetting , he added .
you know , mon cher , your father and i had some accounts to settle , so i have received what was due from the ryazán estate and will keep it ; you won t require it .
we ll go into the accounts by what was due from the ryazán estate prince vasíli meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from pierre s peasants , which the prince had retained for himself .
in petersburg , as in moscow , pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection .
he could not refuse the post , or rather the rank ( for he did nothing ) , that prince vasíli had procured for him , and acquaintances , invitations , and social occupations were so numerous that , even more than in moscow , he felt a sense of bewilderment , bustle , and continual expectation of some good , always in front of him but never attained .
of his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in petersburg .
the guards had gone to the front ; dólokhov had been reduced to the ranks ; anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces ; prince andrew was abroad ; so pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them , or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected .
his whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at prince vasíli s house in the company of the stout princess , his wife , and his beautiful daughter hélène .
like the others , anna pávlovna schérer showed pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society .
formerly in anna pávlovna s presence , pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place , tactless and unsuitable , that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them , while on the contrary hippolyte s stupidest remarks came out clever and apt .
now everything pierre said was charmant .
even if anna pávlovna did not say so , he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty .
in the beginning of the winter of pierre received one of anna pávlovna s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added you will find the beautiful hélène here , whom it is always delightful to when he read that sentence , pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and hélène , and that thought both alarmed him , as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill , and pleased him as an entertaining supposition .
anna pávlovna s at home was like the former one , only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not mortemart , but a diplomatist fresh from berlin with the very latest details of the emperor alexander s visit to potsdam , and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race .
anna pávlovna received pierre with a shade of melancholy , evidently relating to the young man s recent loss by the death of count bezúkhov ( everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known ) , and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august majesty the empress márya fëdorovna .
pierre felt flattered by this .
anna pávlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill .
the large group , in which were prince vasíli and the generals , had the benefit of the diplomat .
another group was at the tea table .
pierre wished to join the former , but anna was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in pierre , touched his sleeve with her finger , saying wait a bit , i have something in view for you this ( she glanced at hélène and smiled at her . )
my dear hélène , be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you .
go and keep her company for ten minutes .
and that it will not be too dull , here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany the beauty went to the aunt , but anna pávlovna detained pierre , looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions .
isn t she exquisite ? she said to pierre , pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away .
and how she carries herself !
for so young a girl , such tact , such masterly perfection of manner !
it comes from her heart .
happy the man who wins her !
with her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society .
don t you think so ?
i only wanted to know your opinion , and anna pávlovna let pierre go .
pierre , in reply , sincerely agreed with her as to hélène s perfection of manner .
if he ever thought of hélène , it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society .
the old aunt received the two young people in her corner , but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for hélène and inclined rather to show her fear of anna pávlovna .
she looked at her niece , as if inquiring what she was to do with these people .
on leaving them , anna pávlovna again touched pierre s sleeve , saying i hope you won t say that it is dull in my house again , and she glanced at hélène .
hélène smiled , with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted .
the aunt coughed , swallowed , and said in french that she was very pleased to see hélène , then she turned to pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look .
in the middle of a dull and halting conversation , hélène turned to pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone .
pierre was so used to that smile , and it had so little meaning for him , that he paid no attention to it .
the aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to pierre s father , count bezúkhov , and showed them her own box .
princess hélène asked to see the portrait of the aunt s husband on the box lid .
that is probably the work of vinesse , said pierre , mentioning a celebrated miniaturist , and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table .
he half rose , meaning to go round , but the aunt handed him the snuffbox , passing it across hélène s back .
hélène stooped forward to make room , and looked round with a smile .
she was , as always at evening parties , wearing a dress such as was then fashionable , cut very low at front and back .
her bust , which had always seemed like marble to pierre , was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders , so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them .
he was conscious of the warmth of her body , the scent of perfume , and the creaking of her corset as she moved .
he did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress , but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments .
and having once seen this he could not help being aware of it , just as we can not renew an illusion we have once seen through .
so you have never noticed before how beautiful i am ? hélène seemed to say .
you had not noticed that i am a woman ?
yes , i am a woman who may belong to you too , said her glance .
and at that moment pierre felt that hélène not only could , but must , be his wife , and that it could not be otherwise .
he knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her .
how and when this would be he did not know , he did not even know if it would be a good thing ( he even felt , he knew not why , that it would be a bad thing ) , but he knew it would happen .
pierre dropped his eyes , lifted them again , and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him , as he had seen her every day until then , but he could no longer do it .
he could not , any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass .
she was terribly close to him .
she already had power over him , and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will .
well , i will leave you in your little corner , came anna pávlovna s voice , i see you are all right and pierre , anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible , looked round with a blush .
it seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself .
a little later when he went up to the large circle , anna pávlovna said to him i hear you are refitting your petersburg house ? this was true .
the architect had told him that it was necessary , and pierre , without knowing why , was having his enormous petersburg house done up .
that s a good thing , but don t move from prince vasíli s .
it is good to have a friend like the prince , she said , smiling at prince vasíli .
i know something about that .
don t i ?
and you are still so young .
you need advice .
don t be angry with me for exercising an old woman s she paused , as women always do , expecting something after they have mentioned their age .
if you marry it will be a different thing , she continued , uniting them both in one glance .
pierre did not look at hélène nor she at him .
but she was just as terribly close to him .
he muttered something and colored .
when he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened .
what had happened ?
nothing .
he had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child , of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said yes , she s good looking , he had understood that this woman might belong to him .
but she s stupid .
i have myself said she is stupid , he thought .
there is something nasty , something wrong , in the feeling she excites in me .
i have been told that her brother anatole was in love with her and she with him , that there was quite a scandal and that that s why he was sent away .
hippolyte is her brother
prince vasíli is her father it s bad he reflected , but while he was thinking this ( the reflection was still incomplete ) , he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up , and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife , how she would love him become quite different , and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false .
and he again saw her not as the daughter of prince vasíli , but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress .
but no !
why did this thought never occur to me before ? and again he told himself that it was impossible , that there would be something unnatural , and as it seemed to him dishonorable , in this marriage .
he recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together .
he recalled anna pávlovna s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house , recalled thousands of such hints from prince vasíli and others , and was seized by terror lest he had already , in some way , bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do .
but at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself , in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty .
in november , , prince vasíli had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces .
he had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son anatole where his regiment was stationed , and take him to visit prince nicholas bolkónski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man .
but before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs , prince vasíli had to settle matters with pierre , who , it is true , had latterly spent whole days at home , that is , in prince vasíli s house where he was staying , and had been absurd , excited , and foolish in hélène s presence ( as a lover should be ) , but had not yet proposed to her .
this is all very fine , but things must be settled , said prince vasíli to himself , with a sorrowful sigh , one morning , feeling that pierre who was under such obligations to him ( but never mind that ) was not behaving very well in this matter .
youth , frivolity well , god be with him , thought he , relishing his own goodness of heart , but it must be brought to a head .
the day after tomorrow will be lëlya s name day .
i will invite two or three people , and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my , my affair .
i am her six weeks after anna pávlovna s at home and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry hélène would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away , pierre , despite that decision , had not left prince vasíli s and felt with terror that in people s eyes he was every day more and more connected with her , that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her , that he could not break away from her , and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers .
he might perhaps have been able to free himself but that prince vasíli ( who had rarely before given receptions ) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone s expectation .
prince vasíli , in the rare moments when he was at home , would take pierre s hand in passing and draw it downwards , or hold out his wrinkled , cheek for pierre to kiss and would say till tomorrow , or , be in to dinner or i shall not see you , or , i am staying in for your sake , and so on .
and though prince vasíli , when he stayed in ( as he said ) for pierre s sake , hardly exchanged a couple of words with him , pierre felt unable to disappoint him .
every day he said to himself one and the same thing it is time i understood her and made up my mind what she really is .
was i mistaken before , or am i mistaken now ?
no , she is not stupid , she is an excellent girl , he sometimes said to himself she never makes a mistake , never says anything stupid .
she says little , but what she does say is always clear and simple , so she is not stupid .
she never was abashed and is not abashed now , so she can not be a bad woman ! he had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company , and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate that it did not interest by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed pierre her superiority .
she was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile .
she always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone , in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face .
pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line , and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it , but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step .
a thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss , pierre said to himself what am i doing ?
i need resolution .
can it be that i have none ? he wished to take a decision , but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed .
pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent , and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at anna pávlovna s , an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will .
on hélène s name day , a small party of just their own his wife for supper at prince vasíli s .
all these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening .
the visitors were seated at supper .
princess kurágina , a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome , was sitting at the head of the table .
on either side of her sat the more important old general and his wife , and anna pávlovna schérer .
at the other end sat the younger and less important guests , and there too sat the members of the family , and pierre and hélène , side by side .
prince vasíli was not having any supper he went round the table in a merry mood , sitting down now by one , now by another , of the guests .
to each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to pierre and hélène , whose presence he seemed not to notice .
he enlivened the whole party .
the wax candles burned brightly , the silver and crystal gleamed , so did the ladies toilets and the gold and silver of the men s epaulets ; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table , the clatter of plates , knives , and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations .
at one end of the table , the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately , at which she laughed ; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some mary víktorovna or other .
at the center of the table , prince vasíli attracted everybody s attention .
with a facetious smile on his face , he was telling the ladies about last wednesday s meeting of the imperial council , at which sergéy kuzmích vyazmítinov , the new military governor general of petersburg , had received and read the then famous rescript of the emperor alexander from the army to sergéy kuzmích , in which the emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people s loyalty , that the declaration from petersburg gave him particular pleasure , and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it .
this rescript began with the words sergéy kuzmích , from all sides reports reach me , etc .
well , and so he never got farther than sergéy kuzmích ? asked one of the ladies .
exactly , not a hair s breadth farther , answered prince vasíli , laughing , sergéy kuzmích from all sides from all sides sergéy kuzmích poor vyazmítinov could not get any farther !
he began the rescript again and again , but as soon as he uttered sergéy he sobbed , , tears , and from all sides was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther .
and again his handkerchief , and again sergéy kuzmích , from all sides , and tears , till at last somebody else was asked to read kuzmích from all sides and then tears , someone repeated laughing .
don t be unkind , cried anna pávlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger .
he is such a worthy and excellent man , our dear vyazmítinov everybody laughed a great deal .
at the head of the table , where the honored guests sat , everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations .
only pierre and hélène sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table , a suppressed smile brightening both their faces , a smile that had nothing to do with sergéy smile of bashfulness at their own feelings .
but much as all the rest laughed , talked , and joked , much as they enjoyed their rhine wine , sauté , and ices , and however they avoided looking at the young couple , and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them , one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about sergéy kuzmích , the laughter , and the food were all a pretense , and that the whole attention of that company was directed and hélène .
prince vasíli mimicked the sobbing of sergéy kuzmích and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter , and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said yes it s getting on , it will all be settled anna pávlovna threatened him on behalf of our dear vyazmítinov , and in her eyes , which , for an instant , glanced at pierre , prince vasíli read a congratulation on his future and on his daughter s happiness .
the old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter , and her sigh seemed to say yes , there s nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine , my dear , now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly , provocatively and what nonsense all this is that i am saying ! thought a diplomatist , glancing at the happy faces of the lovers .
that s happiness ! into the insignificant , trifling , and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another .
and this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter .
jests fell flat , news was not interesting , and the animation was evidently forced .
not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this , and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful hélène with her radiant face and at the red , broad , and happy though uneasy face of pierre .
it seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone .
pierre felt that he was the center of it all , and this both pleased and embarrassed him .
he was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation .
he did not see , hear , or understand anything clearly .
only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind .
so it is all finished ! he thought .
and how has it all happened ?
how quickly !
now i know that not because of her alone , nor of myself alone , but because of everyone , it must inevitably come about .
they are all expecting it , they are so sure that it will happen that i can not , i can not , disappoint them .
but how will it be ?
i do not know , but it will certainly happen ! thought pierre , glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes .
or he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what .
he felt it awkward to attract everyone s attention and to be considered a lucky man and , with his plain face , to be looked on as a sort of paris possessed of a helen .
but no doubt it always is and must be so ! he consoled himself .
and besides , what have i done to bring it about ?
how did it begin ?
i traveled from moscow with prince vasíli .
then there was nothing .
so why should i not stay at his house ?
then i played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her .
how did it begin , when did it all come about ? and here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed , seeing , hearing , feeling her nearness , her breathing , her movements , her beauty .
then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful , and that that was why they all looked so at him , and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest , raise his head , and rejoice at his good fortune .
suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time .
but pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said .
i am asking you when you last heard from bolkónski , repeated prince vasíli a third time .
how you are , my dear prince vasíli smiled , and pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and hélène .
well , what of it , if you all know it ? thought pierre .
what of it ?
it s the truth ! and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile , and hélène smiled too .
when did you get the letter ?
was it from olmütz ? repeated prince vasíli , who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute .
how can one talk or think of such trifles ? thought pierre .
yes , from olmütz , he answered , with a sigh .
after supper pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room .
the guests began to disperse , some without taking leave of hélène .
some , as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation , came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away , refusing to let her see them off .
the diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room .
he pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with pierre s happiness .
the old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was .
oh , the old fool , he thought .
that princess hélène will be beautiful still when she s i think i may congratulate you , whispered anna pávlovna to the old princess , kissing her soundly .
if i hadn t this headache i d have stayed the old princess did not reply , she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter s happiness .
while the guests were taking their leave pierre remained for a long time alone with hélène in the little drawing room where they were sitting .
he had often before , during the last six weeks , remained alone with her , but had never spoken to her of love .
now he felt that it was inevitable , but he could not make up his mind to take the final step .
he felt ashamed ; he felt that he was occupying someone else s place here beside hélène .
this happiness is not for you , some inner voice whispered to him .
this happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in but , as he had to say something , he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party .
she replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had .
some of the nearest relatives had not yet left .
they were sitting in the large drawing room .
prince vasíli came up to pierre with languid footsteps .
pierre rose and said it was getting late .
prince vasíli gave him a look of stern inquiry , as though what pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in .
but then the expression of severity changed , and he drew pierre s hand downwards , made him sit down , and smiled affectionately .
well , lëlya ? he asked , turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood , but which prince vasíli had only acquired by imitating other parents .
and he again turned to pierre .
sergéy all he said , unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat .
pierre smiled , but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about sergéy kuzmích that interested prince vasíli just then , and prince vasíli saw that pierre knew this .
he suddenly muttered something and went away .
it seemed to pierre that even the prince was disconcerted .
the sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched pierre he looked at hélène and she too seemed disconcerted , and her look seemed to say well , it is your own the step must be taken but i can not , i can not ! thought pierre , and he again began speaking about indifferent matters , about sergéy kuzmích , asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly .
hélène answered with a smile that she too had missed it .
when prince vasíli returned to the drawing room , the princess , his wife , was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about pierre .
of course , it is a very brilliant match , but happiness , my dear marriages are made in heaven , replied the elderly lady .
prince vasíli passed by , seeming not to hear the ladies , and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room .
he closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing .
his head sank forward and then he roused himself .
aline , he said to his wife , go and see what they are the princess went up to the door , passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air , and glanced into the little drawing room .
pierre and hélène still sat talking just as before .
still the same , she said to her husband .
prince vasíli frowned , twisting his mouth , his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse , unpleasant expression peculiar to him .
shaking himself , he rose , threw back his head , and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room .
with quick steps he went joyfully up to pierre .
his face was so unusually triumphant that pierre rose in alarm on seeing it .
thank god ! said prince vasíli .
my wife has told me everything ! ( he put one arm around pierre and the other around his daughter .
) my dear boy lëlya
i am very ( his voice trembled . )
i loved your father and she will make you a good wife god bless you ! he embraced his daughter , and then again pierre , and kissed him with his malodorous mouth .
tears actually moistened his cheeks .
princess , come here ! he shouted .
the old princess came in and also wept .
the elderly lady was using her handkerchief too .
pierre was kissed , and he kissed the beautiful hélène s hand several times .
after a while they were left alone again .
all this had to be and could not be otherwise , thought pierre , so it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad .
it is good because it s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence , looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell .
hélène ! he said aloud and paused .
something special is always said in such cases , he thought , but could not remember what it was that people say .
he looked at her face .
she drew nearer to him .
her face flushed .
oh , take those off those she said , pointing to his spectacles .
pierre took them off , and his eyes , besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed , had also a frightened and inquiring look .
he was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it , but with a rapid , almost brutal movement of her head , she intercepted his lips and met them with her own .
her face struck pierre , by its altered , unpleasantly excited expression .
it is too late now , it s done ; besides i love her , thought pierre .
je vous aime ! he said , remembering what has to be said at such moments but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself .
i love six weeks later he was married , and settled in count bezúkhov s large , newly furnished petersburg house , the happy possessor , as people said , of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money .
old prince nicholas bolkónski received a letter from prince vasíli in november , , announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit .
i am starting on a journey of inspection , and of course i shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time , my honored benefactor , wrote prince vasíli .
my son anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army , so i hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that , emulating his father , he feels for it seems that there will be no need to bring mary out , suitors are coming to us of their own accord , incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news .
prince nicholas frowned , but said nothing .
a fortnight after the letter prince vasíli s servants came one evening in advance of him , and he and his son arrived next day .
old bolkónski had always had a poor opinion of prince vasíli s character , but more so recently , since in the new reigns of paul and alexander prince vasíli had risen to high position and honors .
and now , from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess , he saw which way the wind was blowing , and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will .
he snorted whenever he mentioned him .
on the day of prince vasíli s arrival , prince bolkónski was particularly discontented and out of temper .
whether he was in a bad temper because prince vasíli was coming , or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at prince vasíli s visit , he was in a bad temper , and in the morning tíkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his report .
do you hear how he s walking ? said tíkhon , drawing the architect s attention to the sound of the prince s footsteps .
stepping flat on his know what that means however , at nine o clock the prince , in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap , went out for his usual walk .
it had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse , along which the prince was in the habit of walking , had been swept the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path .
the prince went through the conservatories , the serfs quarters , and the outbuildings , frowning and silent .
can a sleigh pass ? he asked his overseer , a venerable man , resembling his master in manners and looks , who was accompanying him back to the house .
the snow is deep .
i am having the avenue swept , your the prince bowed his head and went up to the porch .
god be thanked , thought the overseer , the storm has blown over ! it would have been hard to drive up , your honor , he added .
i heard , your honor , that a minister is coming to visit your the prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him , frowning .
what ?
a minister ?
what minister ?
who gave orders ? he said in his shrill , harsh voice .
the road is not swept for the princess my daughter , but for a minister !
for me , there are no ministers ! your honor , i thought you thought ! shouted the prince , his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly .
you thought !
rascals !
blackguards !
i ll teach you to think ! and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit alpátych , the overseer , had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow .
thought blackguards shouted the prince rapidly .
but although alpátych , frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke , came up to the prince , bowing his bald head resignedly before him , or perhaps for that very reason , the prince , though he continued to shout blackguards !
throw the snow back on the road ! did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house .
before dinner , princess mary and mademoiselle bourienne , who knew that the prince was in a bad humor , stood awaiting him ; mademoiselle bourienne with a radiant face that said i know nothing , i am the same as usual , and princess mary pale , frightened , and with downcast eyes .
what she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like mademoiselle bourienne , but could not .
she thought if i seem not to notice he will think that i do not sympathize with him ; if i seem sad and out of spirits myself , he will say ( as he has done before ) that i m in the the prince looked at his daughter s frightened face and snorted .
fool or dummy ! he muttered .
and the other one is not here .
they ve been telling tales , he to the little princess who was not in the dining room .
where is the princess ? he asked .
hiding ? she is not very well , answered mademoiselle bourienne with a bright smile , so she won t come down .
it is natural in her hm !
hm ! muttered the prince , sitting down .
his plate seemed to him not quite clean , and pointing to a spot he flung it away .
tíkhon caught it and handed it to a footman .
the little princess was not unwell , but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that , hearing he was in a bad humor , she had decided not to appear .
i am afraid for the baby , she said to mademoiselle bourienne heaven knows what a fright might in general at bald hills the little princess lived in constant fear , and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling .
the prince reciprocated this antipathy , but it was overpowered by his contempt for her .
when the little princess had grown accustomed to life at bald hills , she took a special fancy to mademoiselle bourienne , spent whole days with her , asked her to sleep in her room , and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him .
so we are to have visitors , mon prince ? remarked mademoiselle bourienne , unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers .
his excellency prince vasíli kurágin and his son , i understand ? she said inquiringly .
hm ! excellency is a puppy
i got him his appointment in the service , said the prince disdainfully .
why his son is coming i don t understand .
perhaps princess elizabeth and princess mary know .
i don t want ( he looked at his blushing daughter . )
are you unwell today ?
eh ?
afraid of the minister as that idiot alpátych called him this morning ? no , mon though mademoiselle bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject , she did not stop talking , but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened , and after the soup the prince became more genial .
after dinner , he went to see his .
the little princess was sitting at a small table , chattering with másha , her maid .
she grew pale on seeing her .
she was much altered .
she was now plain rather than pretty .
her cheeks had sunk , her lip was drawn up , and her eyes drawn down .
yes , i feel a kind of oppression , she said in reply to the prince s question as to how she felt .
do you want anything ? no , merci , mon well , all right , all he left the room and went to the waiting room where alpátych stood with bowed head .
has the snow been shoveled back ? yes , your excellency .
forgive me for heaven s sake
it was only my all right , all right , interrupted the prince , and laughing his unnatural way , he stretched out his hand for alpátych to kiss , and then proceeded to his study .
prince vasíli arrived that evening .
he was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen , who , with loud shouts , dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow .
prince vasíli and anatole had separate rooms assigned to them .
anatole , having taken off his overcoat , sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and fixed his large and handsome eyes .
he regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him .
and he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way .
all this might , he thought , turn out very well and amusingly .
and why not marry her if she really has so much money ?
that never does any harm , thought anatole .
he shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and , his handsome head held high , entered his father s room with the and victorious air natural to him .
prince vasíli s two valets were busy dressing him , and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered , as if to say yes , that s how i want you to i say , father , joking apart , is she very hideous ? anatole asked , as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey .
enough !
what nonsense !
above all , try to be respectful and cautious with the old if he starts a row i ll go away , said prince anatole .
i can t bear those old men !
eh ? remember , for you everything depends on in the meantime , not only was it known in the maidservants rooms that the minister and his son had arrived , but the appearance of both had been minutely described .
princess mary was sitting alone in her room , vainly trying to master her agitation .
why did they write , why did lise tell me about it ?
it can never happen ! she said , looking at herself in the glass .
how shall i enter the drawing room ?
even if i like him i can t now be myself with the mere thought of her father s look filled her with terror .
the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne had already received from másha , the lady s maid , the necessary report of how handsome the minister s son was , with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows , and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle , three steps at a time .
having received this information , the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne , whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor , went into princess mary s room .
you know they ve come , marie ? said the little princess , waddling in , and sinking heavily into an armchair .
she was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning , but had on one of her best dresses .
her hair was carefully done and her face was animated , which , however , did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines .
dressed as she used to be in petersburg society , it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become .
some unobtrusive touch had been added to mademoiselle bourienne s toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive .
what !
are you going to remain as you are , dear princess ? she began .
they ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down , and you have not smartened yourself up at all ! the little princess got up , rang for the maid , and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how princess mary should be dressed .
princess mary s was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her , and still more so by both her companions not having the least conception that it could be otherwise .
to tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation , while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence .
she flushed , her beautiful eyes grew dim , red blotches came on her face , and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore , as she submitted herself to mademoiselle bourienne and lise .
both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty .
she was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival , so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity , and with the naïve and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty .
no really , my dear , this dress is not pretty , said lise , looking sideways at princess mary from a little distance .
you have a maroon dress , have it fetched .
really !
you know the fate of your whole life may be at stake .
but this one is too light , it s not becoming ! it was not the dress , but the face and whole figure of princess mary that was not pretty , but neither mademoiselle bourienne nor the little princess felt this ; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair , the hair combed up , and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress , and so on , all would be well .
they forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered , and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face , it would still remain piteous and plain .
after two or three changes to which princess mary meekly submitted , just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head ( a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks ) and she had put on a maroon dress with a scarf , the little princess walked twice round her , now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand , now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other .
no , it will not do , she said decidedly , clasping her hands .
no , mary , really this dress does not suit you .
i prefer you in your little gray everyday dress .
now please , do it for my sake .
katie , she said to the maid , bring the princess her gray dress , and you ll see , mademoiselle bourienne , how i shall arrange it , she added , smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure .
but when katie brought the required dress , princess mary remained sitting motionless before the glass , looking at her face , and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering , ready to burst into sobs .
come , dear princess , said mademoiselle bourienne , just one more little the little princess , taking the dress from the maid , came up to princess mary .
well , now we ll arrange something quite simple and becoming , she said .
the three voices , hers , mademoiselle bourienne s , and katie s , who was laughing at something , mingled in a merry sound , like the chirping of birds .
no , leave me alone , said princess mary .
her voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once .
they looked at the beautiful , large , thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts , gazing shiningly and imploringly at them , and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist .
at least , change your coiffure , said the little princess .
didn t i tell you , she went on , turning reproachfully to mademoiselle bourienne , mary s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least .
not in the least !
please change leave me alone , please leave me alone !
it is all quite the same to me , answered a voice struggling with tears .
mademoiselle bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that princess mary in this guise looked very plain , worse than usual , but it was too late .
she was looking at them with an expression they both knew , an expression thoughtful and sad .
this expression in princess mary did not frighten them ( she never inspired fear in anyone ) , but they knew that when it appeared on her face , she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination .
you will change it , won t you ? said lise .
and as princess mary gave no answer , she left the room .
princess mary was left alone .
she did not comply with lise s request , she not only left her hair as it was , but did not even look in her glass .
letting her arms fall helplessly , she sat with downcast eyes and pondered .
a husband , a man , a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination , and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own .
she fancied a child , her as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse s her own breast , the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child .
but no , it is impossible , i am too ugly , she thought .
please come to tea .
the prince will be out in a moment , came the maid s voice at the door .
she roused herself , and felt appalled at what she had been thinking , and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and , her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the saviour lit by a lamp , she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments .
a painful doubt filled her soul .
could the joy of love , of earthly love for a man , be for her ?
in her thoughts of marriage princess mary dreamed of happiness and of children , but her strongest , most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love .
the more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself , the stronger it grew .
o god , she said , how am i to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil ?
how am i to renounce forever these vile fancies , so as peacefully to fulfill thy will ? and scarcely had she put that question than god gave her the answer in her own heart .
desire nothing for thyself , seek nothing , be not anxious or envious .
man s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee , but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything .
if it be god s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage , be ready to fulfill his with this consoling thought ( but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing ) princess mary sighed , and having crossed herself went down , thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say .
what could all that matter in comparison with the will of god , without whose care not a hair of man s head can fall ?
when princess mary came down , prince vasíli and his son were already in the drawing room , talking to the little princess and mademoiselle bourienne .
when she entered with her heavy step , treading on her heels , the gentlemen and mademoiselle bourienne rose and the little princess , indicating her to the gentlemen , said voilà marie ! princess mary saw them all and saw them in detail .
she saw prince vasíli s face , serious for an instant at the sight of her , but immediately smiling again , and the little princess curiously noting the impression marie produced on the visitors .
and she saw mademoiselle bourienne , with her ribbon and pretty face , and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him , but him she could not see , she only saw something large , brilliant , and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room .
prince vasíli approached first , and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that , on the contrary , she remembered him quite well .
then anatole came up to her .
she still could not see him .
she only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly , and she touched with her lips a white forehead , over which was beautiful hair smelling of pomade .
when she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty .
anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform , his chest expanded and his back drawn in , slightly swinging one foot , and , with his head a little bent , looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all .
anatole was not , nor ready or eloquent in conversation , but he had the faculty , so invaluable in society , of composure and imperturbable .
if a man lacking in remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say , the effect is bad .
but anatole was dumb , swung his foot , and smilingly examined the princess hair .
it was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time .
if anyone finds this silence inconvenient , let him talk , but i don t want to , he seemed to say .
besides this , in his behavior to women anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity , awe , and even supercilious consciousness of his own superiority .
it was as if he said to them i know you , i know you , but why should i bother about you ?
you d be only too glad , of perhaps he did not really think this when he met probably he did not , for in general he thought very his looks and manner gave that impression .
the princess felt this , and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him , she turned to his father .
the conversation was general and animated , thanks to princess lise s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth .
she met prince vasíli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people , and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some , jokes and amusing reminiscences , though no such reminiscences really as none existed in this case .
prince vasíli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew anatole , whom she hardly knew , into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred .
mademoiselle bourienne also shared them and even princess mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences .
here at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves , dear prince , said the little princess ( of course , in french ) to prince vasíli .
it s not as at annette s receptions where you always ran away ; you remember cette chère annette ! anna pávlovna .
ah , but you won t talk politics to me like annette ! and our little tea table ? oh , yes ! why is it you were never at annette s ? the little princess asked anatole .
ah , i know , i know , she said with a sly glance , your brother hippolyte told me about your goings on .
oh ! and she shook her finger at him , i have even heard of your doings in paris ! and didn t hippolyte tell you ? asked prince vasíli , turning to his son and seizing the little princess arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her , didn t he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess , and how she showed him the door ?
oh , she is a pearl among women , princess , he added , turning to princess mary .
when paris was mentioned , mademoiselle bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections .
she took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since anatole had left paris and how he had liked that city .
anatole answered the frenchwoman very readily and , looking at her with a smile , talked to her about her native land .
when he saw the pretty little bourienne , anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find bald hills dull either .
not at all bad ! he thought , examining her , not at all bad , that little companion !
i hope she will bring her along with her when we re married , la petite est the little one is charming .
the old prince dressed leisurely in his study , frowning and considering what he was to do .
the coming of these visitors annoyed him .
what are prince vasíli and that son of his to me ?
prince vasíli is a shallow braggart and his son , no doubt , is a fine specimen , he grumbled to himself .
what angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle , one about which he always deceived himself .
the question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband .
the prince never directly asked himself that question , knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly , and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life .
life without princess mary , little as he seemed to value her , was unthinkable to him .
and why should she marry ? he thought .
to be unhappy for certain .
there s lise , married to better husband one would think could hardly be found is she contented with her lot ?
and who would marry marie for love ?
plain and awkward !
they ll take her for her connections and wealth .
are there no women living unmarried , and even the happier for it ? so thought prince bolkónski while dressing , and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer .
prince vasíli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing , and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer .
his birth and position in society were not bad .
well , i ve nothing against it , the prince said to himself , but he must be worthy of her .
and that is what we shall that is what we shall see !
that is what we shall see ! he added aloud .
he entered the drawing room with his usual alert step , glancing rapidly round the company .
he noticed the change in the little princess dress , mademoiselle bourienne s ribbon , princess mary s unbecoming coiffure , mademoiselle bourienne s and anatole s smiles , and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation .
got herself up like a fool ! he thought , looking irritably at her .
she is shameless , and he ignores her ! he went straight up to prince vasíli .
well !
how d ye do ?
how d ye do ?
glad to see you ! friendship laughs at distance , began prince vasíli in his usual rapid , , familiar tone .
here is my second son ; please love and befriend prince bolkónski surveyed anatole .
fine young fellow !
fine young fellow ! he said .
well , come and kiss me , and he offered his cheek .
anatole kissed the old man , and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure , waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect .
prince bolkónski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and , drawing up an armchair for prince vasíli , pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news .
he seemed to listen attentively to what prince vasíli said , but kept glancing at princess mary .
and so they are writing from potsdam already ? he said , repeating prince vasíli s last words .
then rising , he suddenly went up to his daughter .
is it for visitors you ve got yourself up like that , eh ? said he .
fine , very fine !
you have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors , and before the visitors i tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my it was my fault , mon père , interceded the little princess , with a blush .
you must do as you please , said prince bolkónski , bowing to his , but she need not make a fool of herself , she s plain enough as it and he sat down again , paying no more attention to his daughter , who was reduced to tears .
on the contrary , that coiffure suits the princess very well , said prince vasíli .
now you , young prince , what s your name ? said prince bolkónski , turning to anatole , come here , let us talk and get now the fun begins , thought anatole , sitting down with a smile beside the old prince .
well , my dear boy , i hear you ve been educated abroad , not taught to read and write by the deacon , like your father and me .
now tell me , my dear boy , are you serving in the horse guards ? asked the old man , scrutinizing anatole closely and intently .
no , i have been transferred to the line , said anatole , hardly able to restrain his laughter .
ah !
that s a good thing .
so , my dear boy , you wish to serve the tsar and the country ?
it is wartime .
such a fine fellow must serve .
well , are you off to the front ? no , prince , our regiment has gone to the front , but i am attached what is it i am attached to , papa ? said anatole , turning to his father with a laugh .
a splendid soldier , splendid !
what am i attached to ! ha , ha , ha ! laughed prince bolkónski , and anatole laughed still louder .
suddenly prince bolkónski frowned .
you may go , he said to anatole .
anatole returned smiling to the ladies .
and so you ve had him educated abroad , prince vasíli , haven t you ? said the old prince to prince vasíli .
i have done my best for him , and i can assure you the education there is much better than yes , everything is different nowadays , everything is changed .
the lad s a fine fellow , a fine fellow !
well , come with me he took prince vasíli s arm and led him to his study .
as soon as they were alone together , prince vasíli announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince .
well , do you think i shall prevent her , that i can t part from her ? said the old prince angrily .
what an idea !
i m ready for it tomorrow !
only let me tell you , i want to know my better .
you know my aboveboard !
i will ask her tomorrow in your presence ; if she is willing , then he can stay on .
he can stay and i ll the old prince snorted .
let her marry , it s all the same to me ! he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son .
i will tell you frankly , said prince vasíli in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so a companion .
you know , you see right through people .
anatole is no genius , but he is an honest , goodhearted lad ; an excellent son or all right , all right , we ll see ! as always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society , on anatole s appearance all the three women of prince bolkónski s household felt that their life had not been real till then .
their powers of reasoning , feeling , and observing immediately increased tenfold , and their life , which seemed to have been passed in darkness , was suddenly lit up by a new brightness , full of significance .
princess mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure .
the handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention .
he seemed to her kind , brave , determined , manly , and magnanimous .
she felt convinced of that .
thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination .
she drove them away and tried to conceal them .
but am i not too cold with him ? thought the princess .
i try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul i feel too near to him already , but then he can not know what i think of him and may imagine that i do not like and princess mary tried , but could not manage , to be cordial to her new guest .
poor girl , she s devilish ugly ! thought anatole .
mademoiselle bourienne , also roused to great excitement by anatole s arrival , thought in another way .
of course , she , a handsome young woman without any definite position , without relations or even a country , did not intend to devote her life to serving prince bolkónski , to reading aloud to him and being friends with princess mary .
mademoiselle bourienne had long been waiting for a russian prince who , able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain , badly dressed , ungainly russian princesses , would fall in love with her and carry her off ; and here at last was a russian prince .
mademoiselle bourienne knew a story , heard from her aunt but finished in her own way , which she liked to repeat to herself .
it was the story of a girl who had been seduced , and to whom her poor mother ( sa pauvre mère ) appeared , and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married .
mademoiselle bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him , her seducer .
and now he , a real russian prince , had appeared .
he would carry her away and then sa pauvre mère would appear and he would marry her .
so her future shaped itself in mademoiselle bourienne s head at the very time she was talking to anatole about paris .
it was not calculation that guided her ( she did not even for a moment consider what she should do ) , but all this had long been familiar to her , and now that anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible .
the little princess , like an old war horse that hears the trumpet , unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition , prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry , without any ulterior motive or any struggle , but with naïve and lighthearted gaiety .
although in female society anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women , his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women .
besides that , he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative mademoiselle bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions .
after tea , the company went into the sitting room and princess mary was asked to play on the clavichord .
anatole , laughing and in high spirits , came and leaned on his elbows , facing her and beside mademoiselle bourienne .
princess mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion .
her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic .
but anatole s expression , though his eyes were fixed on her , referred not to her but to the movements of mademoiselle bourienne s little foot , which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord .
mademoiselle bourienne was also looking at princess mary , and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess .
how she loves me ! thought princess mary .
how happy i am now , and how happy i may be with such a friend and such a husband !
husband ?
can it be possible ? she thought , not daring to look at his face , but still feeling his eyes gazing at her .
in the evening , after supper , when all were about to retire , anatole kissed princess mary s hand .
she did not know how she found the courage , but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes .
turning from princess mary he went up and kissed mademoiselle bourienne s hand .
( this was not etiquette , but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance ! )
mademoiselle bourienne flushed , and gave the princess a frightened look .
what delicacy ! thought the princess .
is it possible that amélie ( mademoiselle bourienne ) thinks i could be jealous of her , and not value her pure affection and devotion to me ? she went up to her and kissed her warmly .
anatole went up to kiss the little princess hand .
no !
no !
no !
when your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well i will give you my hand to kiss .
not till then ! she said .
and smilingly raising a finger at him , she left the room .
they all separated , but , except anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed , all kept awake a long time that night .
is he really to be my husband , this stranger who is so , kind , that is the chief thing , thought princess mary ; and fear , which she had seldom experienced , came upon her .
she feared to look round , it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner .
and this someone was he was also this man with the white forehead , black eyebrows , and red lips .
she rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room .
mademoiselle bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening , vainly expecting someone , now smiling at someone , now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre mère rebuking her for her fall .
the little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made .
she could not lie either on her face or on her side .
every position was awkward and uncomfortable , and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because anatole s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay .
she sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and katie , sleepy and disheveled , beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time , muttering to herself .
i told you it was all lumps and holes ! the little princess repeated .
i should be glad enough to fall asleep , so it s not my fault ! and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry .
the old prince did not sleep either .
tíkhon , half asleep , heard him pacing angrily about and snorting .
the old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter .
the insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another , his daughter , whom he loved more than himself .
he kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act , but instead of that he only excited himself more and more .
the first man that turns forgets her father and everything else , runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself !
glad to throw her father over !
and she knew i should notice it .
fr fr fr !
and don t i see that that idiot had eyes only for shall have to get rid of her .
and how is it she has not pride enough to see it ?
if she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake !
she must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at bourienne .
no , she has no pride but i ll let her see the old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that anatole meant to flirt with mademoiselle bourienne , princess mary s would be wounded and his point ( not to be parted from her ) would be gained , so pacifying himself with this thought , he called tíkhon and began to undress .
what devil brought them here ? thought he , while tíkhon was putting the nightshirt over his old body and chest .
i never invited them .
they came to disturb my there is not much of it devil take em ! he muttered , while his head was still covered by the shirt .
tíkhon knew his master s habit of sometimes thinking aloud , and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt .
gone to bed ? asked the prince .
tíkhon , like all good valets , instinctively knew the direction of his master s thoughts .
he guessed that the question referred to prince vasíli and his son .
they have gone to bed and put out their lights , your no good no good said the prince rapidly , and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown , he went to the couch on which he slept .
though no words had passed between anatole and mademoiselle bourienne , they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance , up to the appearance of the pauvre mère ; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone .
when princess mary went to her father s room at the usual hour , mademoiselle bourienne and anatole met in the conservatory .
princess mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation .
it seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day , but that they also knew what she thought about it .
she read this in tíkhon s face and in that of prince vasíli s valet , who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water .
the old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning .
princess mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father s .
his face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic , when rising from his chair he would walk away from her , repeating in a low voice the same words several times over .
he came to the point at once , treating her ceremoniously .
i have had a proposition made me concerning you , he said with an unnatural smile .
i expect you have guessed that prince vasíli has not come and brought his pupil with him ( for some reason prince bolkónski referred to anatole as a pupil ) for the sake of my beautiful eyes .
last night a proposition was made me on your account and , as you know my principles , i refer it to how am i to understand you , mon père ? said the princess , growing pale and then blushing .
how understand me ! cried her father angrily .
prince vasíli finds you to his taste as a and makes a proposal to you on his pupil s behalf .
that s how it s to be understood !
how understand it !
and i ask you ! i do not know what you think , father , whispered the princess .
i ?
i ?
what of me ?
leave me out of the question .
i m not going to get married .
what about you ?
that s what i want to the princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval , but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never .
she lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think , but would only be able to submit from habit , and she said i wish only to do your will , but if i had to express my own desire she had no time to finish .
the old prince interrupted her .
that s admirable ! he shouted .
he will take you with your dowry and take mademoiselle bourienne into the bargain .
she ll be the wife , while you the prince stopped .
he saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter .
she lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears .
now then , now then , i m only joking ! he said .
remember this , princess , i hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose .
i give you freedom .
only remember that your life s happiness depends on your decision .
never mind me ! but i do not know , father ! there s no need to talk !
he receives his orders and will marry you or anybody ; but you are free to choose go to your room , think it over , and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence yes or no .
i know you will pray over it .
well , pray if you like , but you had better think it over .
go !
yes or no , yes or no , yes or no ! he still shouted when the princess , as if lost in a fog , had already staggered out of the study .
her fate was decided and happily decided .
but what her father had said about mademoiselle bourienne was dreadful .
it was untrue to be sure , but still it was terrible , and she could not help thinking of it .
she was going straight on through the conservatory , neither seeing nor hearing anything , when suddenly the whispering of mademoiselle bourienne aroused her .
she raised her eyes , and two steps away saw anatole embracing the frenchwoman and whispering something to her .
with a horrified expression on his handsome face , anatole looked at princess mary , but did not at once take his arm from the waist of mademoiselle bourienne who had not yet seen her .
who s that ?
why ?
wait a moment ! anatole s face seemed to say .
princess mary looked at them in silence .
she could not understand it .
at last mademoiselle bourienne gave a scream and ran away .
anatole bowed to princess mary with a gay smile , as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident , and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments .
an hour later , tíkhon came to call princess mary to the old prince ; he added that prince vasíli was also there .
when tíkhon came to her princess mary was sitting on the sofa in her room , holding the weeping mademoiselle bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair .
the princess beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at mademoiselle bourienne s pretty face .
no , princess , i have lost your affection forever ! said mademoiselle bourienne .
why ?
i love you more than ever , said princess mary , and i will try to do all i can for your but you despise me .
you who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion .
oh , only my poor mother i quite understand , answered princess mary , with a sad smile .
calm yourself , my dear .
i will go to my father , she said , and went out .
prince vasíli , with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand , was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face , as if stirred to his heart s core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility , when princess mary entered .
he hurriedly took a pinch of snuff .
ah , my dear , my dear ! he began , rising and taking her by both hands .
then , sighing , he added my son s fate is in your hands .
decide , my dear , good , gentle marie , whom i have always loved as a daughter ! he drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye .
fr fr snorted prince bolkónski .
the prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil mean , his son .
do you wish or not to be prince anatole kurágin s wife ?
reply yes or no , he shouted , and then i shall reserve the right to state my opinion also .
yes , my opinion , and only my opinion , added prince bolkónski , turning to prince vasíli and answering his imploring look .
yes , or no ? my desire is never to leave you , father , never to separate my life from yours .
i don t wish to marry , she answered positively , glancing at prince vasíli and at her father with her beautiful eyes .
humbug !
nonsense !
humbug , humbug , humbug ! cried prince bolkónski , frowning and taking his daughter s hand ; he did not kiss her , but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it , and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry .
prince vasíli rose .
my dear , i must tell you that this is a moment i shall never , never forget .
but , my dear , will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart , so kind and generous ?
say perhaps
the future is so long .
say prince , what i have said is all there is in my heart .
i thank you for the honor , but i shall never be your son s well , so that s finished , my dear fellow !
i am very glad to have seen you .
very glad !
go back to your rooms , princess .
go ! said the old prince .
very , very glad to have seen you , repeated he , embracing prince vasíli .
my vocation is a different one , thought princess mary .
my vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness , the happiness of love and .
and cost what it may , i will arrange poor amélie s happiness , she loves him so passionately , and so passionately repents .
i will do all i can to arrange the match between them .
if he is not rich i will give her the means ; i will ask my father and andrew .
i shall be so happy when she is his wife .
she is so unfortunate , a stranger , alone , helpless !
and , oh god , how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself !
perhaps i might have done the same ! thought princess mary .
it was long since the rostóvs had news of nicholas .
not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son s handwriting .
on receiving it , he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste , trying to escape notice , closed the door , and began to read the letter .
anna mikháylovna , who always knew everything that passed in the house , on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand , sobbing and laughing at the same time .
anna mikháylovna , though her circumstances had improved , was still living with the rostóvs .
my dear friend ? said she , in a tone of pathetic inquiry , prepared to sympathize in any way .
the count sobbed yet more .
nikólenka a letter wa a s wounded my darling boy the countess promoted to be an officer thank god how tell the little countess ! anna mikháylovna sat down beside him , with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter , then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count , and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess , and after tea , with god s help , would inform her .
at dinner anna mikháylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about nikólenka , twice asked when the last letter had been received from him , though she knew that already , and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day .
each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at anna mikháylovna , the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters .
natásha , who , of the whole family , was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation , look , and expression , pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and anna mikháylovna , that it had something to do with her brother , and that anna mikháylovna was preparing them for it .
bold as she was , natásha , who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to nikólenka , did not venture to ask any questions at dinner , but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess remarks .
after dinner , she rushed headlong after anna mikháylovna and , dashing at her , flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room .
auntie , darling , do tell me what it is ! nothing , my no , dearest , sweet one , honey , i won t give know you know anna mikháylovna shook her head .
you are a little slyboots , she said .
a letter from nikólenka !
i m sure of it ! exclaimed natásha , reading confirmation in anna mikháylovna s face .
but for god s sake , be careful , you know how it may affect your i will , i will , only tell me !
you won t ?
then i will go and tell at anna mikháylovna , in a few words , told her the contents of the letter , on condition that she should tell no one .
no , on my true word of honor , said natásha , crossing herself , i won t tell anyone ! and she ran off at once to sónya .
nikólenka wounded a letter , she announced in gleeful triumph .
nicholas ! was all sónya said , instantly turning white .
natásha , seeing the impression the news of her brother s wound produced on sónya , felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news .
she rushed to sónya , hugged her , and began to cry .
a little wound , but he has been made an officer ; he is well now , he wrote himself , said she through her tears .
there now !
it s true that all you women are crybabies , remarked pétya , pacing the room with large , resolute strides .
now i m very glad , very glad indeed , that my brother has distinguished himself so .
you are all blubberers and understand natásha smiled through her tears .
you haven t read the letter ? asked sónya .
no , but she said that it was all over and that he s now an thank god ! said sónya , crossing herself .
but perhaps she deceived you .
let us go to pétya paced the room in silence for a time .
if i d been in nikólenka s place i would have killed even more of those frenchmen , he said .
what nasty brutes they are !
i d have killed so many that there d have been a heap of hold your tongue , pétya , what a goose you are ! i m not a goose , but they are who cry about trifles , said pétya .
do you remember him ? natásha suddenly asked , after a moment s silence .
sónya smiled .
do i remember nicholas ? no , sónya , but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly , remember everything ? said natásha , with an expressive gesture , evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning .
i remember nikólenka too , i remember him well , she said .
but i don t remember borís .
i don t remember him a what !
you don t remember borís ? asked sónya in surprise .
it s not that i don t know what he is like , but not as i remember nikólenka .
just shut my eyes and remember , but borís no ! ( she shut her eyes . )
no !
there s nothing at oh , natásha ! said sónya , looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else , with whom joking was out of the question , i am in love with your brother once for all and , whatever may happen to him or to me , shall never cease to love him as long as i natásha looked at sónya with wondering and inquisitive eyes , and said nothing .
she felt that sónya was speaking the truth , that there was such love as sónya was speaking of .
but natásha had not yet felt anything like it .
she believed it could be , but did not understand it .
shall you write to him ? she asked .
sónya became thoughtful .
the question of how to write to nicholas , and whether she ought to write , tormented her .
now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero , would it be right to remind him of herself and , as it might seem , of the obligations to her he had taken on himself ?
i don t know .
i think if he writes , i will write too , she said , blushing .
and you won t feel ashamed to write to him ? sónya smiled .
and i should be ashamed to write to borís .
i m not going why should you be ashamed ? well , i don t know .
it s awkward and would make me and i know why she d be ashamed , said pétya , offended by natásha s previous remark .
it s because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles ( that was how pétya described his namesake , the new count bezúkhov ) and now she s in love with that singer ( he meant natásha s italian singing master ) , that s why she s ashamed ! pétya , you re a stupid ! said natásha .
not more stupid than you , madam , said the pétya , with the air of an old brigadier .
the countess had been prepared by anna mikháylovna s hints at dinner .
on retiring to her own room , she sat in an armchair , her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox , while the tears kept coming into her eyes .
anna mikháylovna , with the letter , came on tiptoe to the countess door and paused .
don t come in , she said to the old count who was following her .
come and she went in , closing the door behind her .
the count put his ear to the keyhole and listened .
at first he heard the sound of indifferent voices , then anna mikháylovna s voice alone in a long speech , then a cry , then silence , then both voices together with glad intonations , and then footsteps .
anna mikháylovna opened the door .
her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill .
it is done ! she said to the count , pointing triumphantly to the countess , who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter , and pressing them alternately to her lips .
when she saw the count , she stretched out her arms to him , embraced his bald head , over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait , and in order to press them again to her lips , she slightly pushed away the bald head .
véra , natásha , sónya , and pétya now entered the room , and the reading of the letter began .
after a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part , and his promotion , nicholas said that he kissed his father s and mother s hands asking for their blessing , and that he kissed véra , natásha , and pétya .
besides that , he sent greetings to monsieur schelling , madame schoss , and his old nurse , and asked them to kiss for him dear sónya , whom he loved and thought of just the same as when she heard this sónya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and , unable to bear the looks turned upon her , ran away into the dancing hall , whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon , and , flushed and smiling , plumped down on the floor .
the countess was crying .
why are you crying , mamma ? asked véra .
from all he says one should be glad and not this was quite true , but the count , the countess , and natásha looked at her reproachfully .
and who is it she takes after ? thought the countess .
nicholas letter was read over hundreds of times , and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess , for she did not let it out of her hands .
the tutors came , and the nurses , and dmítri , and several acquaintances , and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of nikólenka s virtues .
how strange , how extraordinary , how joyful it seemed , that her son , the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her , that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count , that son who had first learned to say pear and then granny , that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings , a manly warrior doing some kind of man s work of his own , without help or guidance .
the universal experience of ages , showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood , did not exist for the countess .
her son s growth toward manhood , at each of its stages , had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way .
as twenty years before , it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry , suck her breast , and begin to speak , so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong , brave man , this model son and officer that , judging by this letter , he now was .
what a style !
how charmingly he describes ! said she , reading the descriptive part of the letter .
and what a soul !
not a word about himself not a word !
about some denísov or other , though he himself , i dare say , is braver than any of them .
he says nothing about his sufferings .
what a heart !
how like him it is !
and how he has remembered everybody !
not forgetting anyone .
i always said when he was only so always said for more than a week preparations were being made , rough drafts of letters to nicholas from all the household were written and copied out , while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count , money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected .
anna mikháylovna , practical woman that she was , had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son .
she had opportunities of sending her letters to the grand duke constantine pávlovich , who commanded the guards .
the rostóvs supposed that the russian guards , abroad , was quite a definite address , and that if a letter reached the grand duke in command of the guards there was no reason why it should not reach the pávlograd regiment , which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood .
and so it was decided to send the letters and money by the grand duke s courier to borís and borís was to forward them to nicholas .
the letters were from the old count , the countess , pétya , véra , natásha , and sónya , and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son .
on the twelfth of november , kutúzov s active army , in camp before olmütz , was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two russian and the austrian .
the guards , just arrived from russia , spent the night ten miles from olmütz and next morning were to come straight to the review , reaching the field at olmütz by ten o clock .
that day nicholas rostóv received a letter from borís , telling him that the ismáylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from olmütz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him .
rostóv was particularly in need of money now that the troops , after their active service , were stationed near olmütz and the camp swarmed with sutlers and austrian jews offering all sorts of tempting wares .
the pávlograds held feast after feast , celebrating awards they had received for the campaign , and made expeditions to olmütz to visit a certain caroline the hungarian , who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses .
rostóv , who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought denísov s horse , bedouin , was in debt all round , to his comrades and the sutlers .
on receiving borís letter he rode with a fellow officer to olmütz , dined there , drank a bottle of wine , and then set off alone to the guards camp to find his old playmate .
rostóv had not yet had time to get his uniform .
he had on a shabby cadet jacket , decorated with a soldier s cross , equally shabby cadet s riding breeches lined with worn leather , and an officer s saber with a sword knot .
the don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a cossack during the campaign , and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head .
as he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress borís and all his comrades of the guards by his of a fighting hussar who had been under fire .
the guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip , parading their cleanliness and discipline .
they had come by easy stages , their knapsacks conveyed on carts , and the austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place .
the regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing , and by the grand duke s orders the men had marched all the way in step ( a practice on which the guards prided themselves ) , the officers on foot and at their proper posts .
borís had been quartered , and had marched all the way , with berg who was already in command of a company .
berg , who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign , had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily .
borís , during the campaign , had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him , and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from pierre had become acquainted with prince andrew bolkónski , through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief s staff .
berg and borís , having rested after yesterday s march , were sitting , clean and neatly dressed , at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them , playing chess .
berg held a smoking pipe between his knees .
borís , in the accurate way characteristic of him , was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting berg s move , and watched his opponent s face , evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on .
well , how are you going to get out of that ? he remarked .
we ll try to , replied berg , touching a pawn and then removing his hand .
at that moment the door opened .
here he is at last ! shouted rostóv .
and berg too !
oh , you petisenfans , allay cushay dormir ! he exclaimed , imitating his russian nurse s french , at which he and borís used to laugh long ago .
dear me , how you have changed ! borís rose to meet rostóv , but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling .
he was about to embrace his friend , but nicholas avoided him .
with that peculiar feeling of youth , that dread of beaten tracks , and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere , nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend .
he wanted to pinch him , push him , do anything but kiss thing everybody did .
but notwithstanding this , borís embraced him in a quiet , friendly way and kissed him three times .
they had not met for nearly half a year and , being at the age when young men take their first steps on life s road , each saw immense changes in the other , quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps .
both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them .
oh , you damned dandies !
clean and fresh as if you d been to a fete , not like us sinners of the line , cried rostóv , with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice , new to borís , pointing to his own breeches .
the german landlady , hearing rostóv s loud voice , popped her head in at the door .
eh , is she pretty ? he asked with a wink .
why do you shout so ?
you ll frighten them ! said borís .
i did not expect you today , he added .
i only sent you the note yesterday by adjutant of kutúzov s , who s a friend of mine .
i did not think he would get it to you so quickly well , how are you ?
been under fire already ? asked borís .
without answering , rostóv shook the soldier s cross of george fastened to the cording of his uniform and , indicating a bandaged arm , glanced at berg with a smile .
as you see , he said .
indeed ?
yes , yes ! said borís , with a smile .
and we too have had a splendid march .
you know , of course , that his imperial highness rode with our regiment all the time , so that we had every comfort and every advantage .
what receptions we had in poland !
what dinners and balls !
i can t tell you .
and the tsarévich was very gracious to all our and the two friends told each other of their doings , the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line , the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the imperial family .
oh , you guards ! said rostóv .
i say , send for some borís made a grimace .
if you really want it , said he .
he went to his bed , drew a purse from under the clean pillow , and sent for wine .
yes , and i have some money and a letter to give you , he added .
rostóv took the letter and , throwing the money on the sofa , put both arms on the table and began to read .
after reading a few lines , he glanced angrily at berg , then , meeting his eyes , hid his face behind the letter .
well , they ve sent you a tidy sum , said berg , eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa .
as for us , count , we get along on our pay .
i can tell you for myself i say , berg , my dear fellow , said rostóv , when you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with , and i happen to be there , i ll go at once , to be out of your way !
do go somewhere , anywhere to the devil ! he exclaimed , and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face , evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words , he added , don t be hurt , my dear fellow ; you know i speak from my heart as to an old oh , don t mention it , count !
i quite understand , said berg , getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice .
go across to our hosts they invited you , added borís .
berg put on the cleanest of coats , without a spot or speck of dust , stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards , in the way affected by the emperor alexander , and , having assured himself from the way rostóv looked at it that his coat had been noticed , left the room with a pleasant smile .
oh dear , what a beast i am ! muttered rostóv , as he read the letter .
why ? oh , what a pig i am , not to have written and to have given them such a fright !
oh , what a pig i am ! he repeated , flushing suddenly .
well , have you sent gabriel for some wine ?
all right let s have some ! in the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to bagratión which the old countess at anna mikháylovna s advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son , asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it .
what nonsense !
much i need it ! said rostóv , throwing the letter under the table .
why have you thrown that away ? asked borís .
it is some letter of recommendation what the devil do i want it for ! why what the devil ? said borís , picking it up and reading the address .
this letter would be of great use to i want nothing , and i won t be anyone s why not ? inquired borís .
it s a lackey s job ! you are still the same dreamer , i see , remarked borís , shaking his head .
and you re still the same diplomatist !
but that s not the point come , how are you ? asked rostóv .
well , as you see .
so far everything s all right , but i confess i should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the why ? because when once a man starts on military service , he should try to make as successful a career of it as oh , that s it ! said rostóv , evidently thinking of something else .
he looked intently and inquiringly into his friend s eyes , evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question .
old gabriel brought in the wine .
shouldn t we now send for berg ? asked borís .
he would drink with you .
i can well , send for him and how do you get on with that german ? asked rostóv , with a contemptuous smile .
he is a very , very nice , honest , and pleasant fellow , answered borís .
again rostóv looked intently into borís eyes and sighed .
berg returned , and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated .
the guardsmen told rostóv of their march and how they had been made much of in russia , poland , and abroad .
they spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander , the grand duke , and told stories of his kindness and irascibility .
berg , as usual , kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself , but in connection with the stories of the grand duke s quick temper he related with gusto how in galicia he had managed to deal with the grand duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement .
with a pleasant smile berg related how the grand duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion , shouting arnauts ! ( arnauts was the tsarévich s favorite expression when he was in a rage ) and called for the company commander .
would you believe it , count , i was not at all alarmed , because i knew i was right .
without boasting , you know , i may say that i know the army orders by heart and know the regulations as well as i do the lord s prayer .
so , count , there never is any negligence in my company , and so my conscience was at ease .
i came forward ( berg stood up and showed how he presented himself , with his hand to his cap , and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and than his did . )
well , he stormed at me , as the saying is , stormed and stormed and stormed !
it was not a matter of life but rather of death , as the saying is .
albanians ! and devils ! and to siberia ! said berg with a sagacious smile .
i knew i was in the right so i kept silent ; was not that best , count ?
hey , are you dumb ? he shouted .
still i remained silent .
and what do you think , count ?
the next day it was not even mentioned in the orders of the day .
that s what keeping one s head means .
that s the way , count , said berg , lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke .
yes , that was fine , said rostóv , smiling .
but borís noticed that he was preparing to make fun of berg , and skillfully changed the subject .
he asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound .
this pleased rostóv and he began talking about it , and as he went on became more and more animated .
he told them of his schön grabern affair , just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it , that is , as they would like it to have been , as they have heard it described by others , and as sounds well , but not at all as it really was .
rostóv was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie .
he began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened , but imperceptibly , involuntarily , and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood .
if he had told the truth to his like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a would either not have believed him or , still worse , would have thought that rostóv was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him .
he could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a frenchman into the wood .
besides , to tell everything as it really happened , it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened .
it is very difficult to tell the truth , and young people are rarely capable of it .
his hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement , he had flown like a storm at the square , cut his way in , slashed right and left , how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted , and so on .
and so he told them all that .
in the middle of his story , just as he was saying you can not imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack , prince andrew , whom borís was expecting , entered the room .
prince andrew , who liked to help young men , was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward borís , who had managed to please him the day before , he wished to do what the young man wanted .
having been sent with papers from kutúzov to the tsarévich , he looked in on borís , hoping to find him alone .
when he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits ( prince andrew could not endure that sort of man ) , he gave borís a pleasant smile , frowned as with eyes he looked at rostóv , bowed slightly and wearily , and sat down languidly on the sofa he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company .
rostóv flushed up on noticing this , but he did not care , this was a mere stranger .
glancing , however , at borís , he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line .
in spite of prince andrew s disagreeable , ironical tone , in spite of the contempt with which rostóv , from his fighting army point of view , regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one , rostóv felt confused , blushed , and became silent .
borís inquired what news there might be on the staff , and what , without indiscretion , one might ask about our plans .
we shall probably advance , replied bolkónski , evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger .
berg took the opportunity to ask , with great politeness , whether , as was rumored , the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled .
to this prince andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order , and berg laughed gaily .
as to your business , prince andrew continued , addressing borís , we will talk of it later ( and he looked round at rostóv ) .
come to me after the review and we will do what is and , having glanced round the room , prince andrew turned to rostóv , whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice , and said i think you were talking of the schön grabern affair ?
were you there ? i was there , said rostóv angrily , as if intending to insult the .
bolkónski noticed the hussar s state of mind , and it amused him .
with a slightly contemptuous smile , he said yes , there are many stories now told about that affair ! yes , stories ! repeated rostóv loudly , looking with eyes suddenly grown furious , now at borís , now at bolkónski .
yes , many stories !
but our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy s fire !
our stories have some weight , not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything ! of whom you imagine me to be one ? said prince andrew , with a quiet and particularly amiable smile .
a strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man s mingled at that moment in rostóv s soul .
i am not talking about you , he said , i don t know you and , frankly , i don t want to .
i am speaking of the staff in and i will tell you this , prince andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority , you wish to insult me , and i am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven t sufficient , but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen .
in a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel , and besides , drubetskóy , who says he is an old friend of yours , is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you .
however , he added rising , you know my name and where to find me , but don t forget that i do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted , and as a man older than you , my advice is to let the matter drop .
well then , on friday after the review i shall expect you , drubetskóy .
au revoir ! exclaimed prince andrew , and with a bow to them both he went out .
only when prince andrew was gone did rostóv think of what he ought to have said .
and he was still more angry at having omitted to say it .
he ordered his horse at once and , coldly taking leave of borís , rode home .
should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant , or really let the matter drop , was the question that worried him all the way .
he thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol , and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated .
the day after rostóv had been to see borís , a review was held of the austrian and russian troops , both those freshly arrived from russia and those who had been campaigning under kutúzov .
the two emperors , the russian with his heir the tsarévich , and the austrian with the archduke , inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men .
from early morning the smart clean troops were on the move , forming up on the field before the fortress .
now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers command , turned with banners flying , formed up at intervals , and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms ; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue , red , and green braided uniforms , with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black , roan , or gray horses ; then again , spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks , came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position .
not only the generals in full parade uniforms , with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost , their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars , and wearing scarves and all their decorations , not only the elegant , pomaded officers , but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost , and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay that no small matter was happening , but an important and solemn affair .
every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance , aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men , and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole .
from early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o clock all had been brought into due order .
the ranks were drawn up on the vast field .
the whole army was extended in three lines the cavalry in front , behind it the artillery , and behind that again the infantry .
a space like a street was left between each two lines of troops .
the three parts of that army were sharply distinguished kutúzov s fighting army ( with the pávlograds on the right flank of the front ) ; those recently arrived from russia , both guards and regiments of the line ; and the austrian troops .
but they all stood in the same lines , under one command , and in a like order .
like wind over leaves ran an excited whisper they re coming !
they re coming ! alarmed voices were heard , and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops .
from the direction of olmütz in front of them , a group was seen approaching .
and at that moment , though the day was still , a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs .
it looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the emperors .
one voice was heard shouting eyes front ! then , like the crowing of cocks at sunrise , this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent .
in the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard .
this was the emperors suites .
the emperors rode up to the flank , and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march .
it seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing , but as if the army itself , rejoicing at the emperors approach , had naturally burst into music .
amid these sounds , only the youthful kindly voice of the emperor alexander was clearly heard .
he gave the words of greeting , and the first regiment roared hurrah ! so deafeningly , continuously , and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted .
rostóv , standing in the front lines of kutúzov s army which the tsar approached first , experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army a feeling of , a proud consciousness of might , and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph .
he felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass ( and he himself an insignificant atom in it ) would go through fire and water , commit crime , die , or perform deeds of highest heroism , and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word .
hurrah !
hurrah !
hurrah ! thundered from all sides , one regiment after another greeting the tsar with the strains of the march , and then hurrah ! then the general march , and again hurrah !
hurrah ! growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar .
till the tsar reached it , each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body , but as soon as he came up it became alive , its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed .
through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices , amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone , hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely , and in front of them two emperors .
upon them the undivided , tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated .
the handsome young emperor alexander , in the uniform of the horse guards , wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back , with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice , attracted everyone s attention .
rostóv was not far from the trumpeters , and with his keen sight had recognized the tsar and watched his approach .
when he was within twenty paces , and nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome , happy young face , he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known .
every trait and every movement of the tsar s seemed to him enchanting .
stopping in front of the pávlograds , the tsar said something in french to the austrian emperor and smiled .
seeing that smile , rostóv involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign .
he longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry .
the tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him .
oh god , what would happen to me if the emperor spoke to me ? thought rostóv .
i should die of happiness ! the tsar addressed the officers also i thank you all , gentlemen , i thank you with my whole to rostóv every word sounded like a voice from heaven .
how gladly would he have died at once for his tsar !
you have earned the george s standards and will be worthy of oh , to die , to die for him , thought rostóv .
the tsar said something more which rostóv did not hear , and the soldiers , straining their lungs , shouted hurrah ! rostóv too , bending over his saddle , shouted hurrah ! with all his might , feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout , if only to express his rapture fully .
the tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided .
how can the emperor be undecided ? thought rostóv , but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting , like everything else the tsar did .
that hesitation lasted only an instant .
the tsar s foot , in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable , touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode , his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins , and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of .
farther and farther he rode away , stopping at other regiments , till at last only his white plumes were visible to rostóv from amid the suites that surrounded the emperors .
among the gentlemen of the suite , rostóv noticed bolkónski , sitting his horse indolently and carelessly .
rostóv recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge bolkónski .
of course not ! he now thought .
is it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment ?
at a time of such love , such rapture , and such , what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter ?
i love and forgive everybody when the emperor had passed nearly all the regiments , the troops began a ceremonial march past him , and rostóv on bedouin , recently purchased from denísov , rode past too , at the rear of his is , alone and in full view of the emperor .
before he reached him , rostóv , who was a splendid horseman , spurred bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited .
bending his foaming muzzle to his chest , his tail extended , bedouin , as if also conscious of the emperor s eye upon him , passed splendidly , lifting his feet with a high and graceful action , as if flying through the air without touching the ground .
rostóv himself , his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse , rode past the emperor with a frowning but blissful face like a vewy devil , as denísov expressed it .
fine fellows , the pávlograds ! remarked the emperor .
my god , how happy i should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant ! thought rostóv .
when the review was over , the newly arrived officers , and also kutúzov s , collected in groups and began to talk about the awards , about the austrians and their uniforms , about their lines , about bonaparte , and how badly the latter would fare now , especially if the essen corps arrived and prussia took our side .
but the talk in every group was chiefly about the emperor alexander .
his every word and movement was described with ecstasy .
they all had but one wish to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the emperor s command .
commanded by the emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone , be it whom it might so thought rostóv and most of the officers after the review .
all were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them .
the day after the review , borís , in his best uniform and with his comrade berg s best wishes for success , rode to olmütz to see bolkónski , wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he that of adjutant to some important personage , a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive .
it is all very well for rostóv , whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time , to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone s lackey , but i who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities , but must avail myself of them ! he reflected .
he did not find prince andrew in olmütz that day , but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two emperors were living with their suites , households , and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world .
he knew no one , and despite his smart guardsman s uniform , all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes , ribbons , and medals , both courtiers and military men , seemed so immeasurably above him , an insignificant officer of the guards , that they not only did not wish to , but simply could not , be aware of his existence .
at the quarters of the commander in chief , kutúzov , where he inquired for bolkónski , all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them .
in spite of this , or rather because of it , next day , november , after dinner he again went to olmütz and , entering the house occupied by kutúzov , asked for bolkónski .
prince andrew was in and borís was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing , but in which five beds now stood , and furniture of various kinds a table , chairs , and a clavichord .
one adjutant , nearest the door , was sitting at the table in a persian dressing gown , writing .
another , the red , stout nesvítski , lay on a bed with his arms under his head , laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him .
a third was playing a viennese waltz on the clavichord , while a fourth , lying on the clavichord , sang the tune .
bolkónski was not there .
none of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing borís .
the one who was writing and whom borís addressed turned round crossly and told him bolkónski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him .
borís thanked him and went to the reception room , where he found some ten officers and generals .
when he entered , prince andrew , his eyes drooping contemptuously ( with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says , if it were not my duty i would not talk to you for a moment ) , was listening to an old russian general with decorations , who stood very erect , almost on tiptoe , with a soldier s obsequious expression on his purple face , reporting something .
very well , then , be so good as to wait , said prince andrew to the general , in russian , speaking with the french intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously , and noticing borís , prince andrew , paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more , nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile .
at that moment borís clearly realized what he had before surmised , that in the army , besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code , which he and the others knew in the regiment , there was another , more important , subordination , which made this , general wait respectfully while captain prince andrew , for his own pleasure , chose to chat with lieutenant drubetskóy .
more than ever was borís resolved to serve in future not according to the written code , but under this unwritten law .
he felt now that merely by having been recommended to prince andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him , a lieutenant of the guards .
prince andrew came up to him and took his hand .
i am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday .
i was fussing about with germans all day .
we went with weyrother to survey the dispositions .
when germans start being accurate , there s no end to it ! borís smiled , as if he understood what prince andrew was alluding to as something generally known .
but it was the first time he had heard weyrother s name , or even the term well , my dear fellow , so you still want to be an adjutant ?
i have been thinking about yes , i was thinking some reason borís could not help of asking the commander in chief .
he has had a letter from prince kurágin about me .
i only wanted to ask because i fear the guards won t be in action , he added as if in apology .
all right , all right .
we ll talk it over , replied prince andrew .
only let me report this gentleman s business , and i shall be at your while prince andrew went to report about the general , that not sharing borís conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that borís felt uncomfortable .
he turned away and waited impatiently for prince andrew s return from the commander in chief s room .
you see , my dear fellow , i have been thinking about you , said prince andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was .
it s no use your going to the commander in chief .
he would say a lot of pleasant things , ask you to dinner ( that would not be bad as regards the unwritten code , thought borís ) , but nothing more would come of it .
there will soon be a battalion of us and adjutants !
but this is what we ll do i have a good friend , an adjutant general and an excellent fellow , prince dolgorúkov ; and though you may not know it , the fact is that now kutúzov with his staff and all of us count for nothing .
everything is now centered round the emperor .
so we will go to dolgorúkov ; i have to go there anyhow and i have already spoken to him about you .
we shall see whether he can not attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the prince andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success .
under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another , which from pride he would never accept for himself , he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him .
he very readily took up borís cause and went with him to dolgorúkov .
it was late in the evening when they entered the palace at olmütz occupied by the emperors and their retinues .
that same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the hofkriegsrath and both emperors took part .
at that council , contrary to the views of the old generals kutúzov and prince schwartzenberg , it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to bonaparte .
the council of war was just over when prince andrew accompanied by borís arrived at the palace to find dolgorúkov .
everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day s council , at which the party of the young had triumphed .
the voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from longer seemed to be in the future but in the past .
all the advantages were on our side .
our enormous forces , undoubtedly superior to napoleon s , were concentrated in one place , the troops inspired by the emperors presence were eager for action .
the strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the austrian general weyrother a lucky accident had ordained that the austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the french had now to be fought ; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps , and bonaparte , evidently weakened , was undertaking nothing .
dolgorúkov , one of the warmest advocates of an attack , had just returned from the council , tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained .
prince andrew introduced his protégé , but prince dolgorúkov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to borís and , evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment , addressed prince andrew in french .
ah , my dear fellow , what a battle we have gained !
god grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious !
however , dear fellow , he said abruptly and eagerly , i must confess to having been unjust to the austrians and especially to weyrother .
what exactitude , what minuteness , what knowledge of the locality , what foresight for every eventuality , every possibility even to the smallest detail !
no , my dear fellow , no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised .
this combination of austrian precision with russian more could be wished for ? so the attack is definitely resolved on ? asked bolkónski .
and do you know , my dear fellow , it seems to me that bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings , you know that a letter was received from him today for the dolgorúkov smiled significantly .
is that so ?
and what did he say ? inquired bolkónski .
what can he say ?
and so on merely to gain time .
i tell you he is in our hands , that s certain !
but what was most amusing , he continued , with a sudden , laugh , was that we could not think how to address the reply !
if not as consul and of course not as emperor , it seemed to me it should be to general but between not recognizing him as emperor and calling him general bonaparte , there is a difference , remarked bolkónski .
that s just it , interrupted dolgorúkov quickly , laughing .
you know s a very clever fellow .
he suggested addressing him as usurper and enemy of dolgorúkov laughed merrily .
only that ? said bolkónski .
all the same , it was bilíbin who found a suitable form for the address .
he is a wise and clever what was it ? to the head of the french government
au chef du gouvernement français , said dolgorúkov , with grave satisfaction .
good , wasn t it ? yes , but he will dislike it extremely , said bolkónski .
oh yes , very much !
my brother knows him , he s dined with present than once in paris , and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle know , a combination of french adroitness and italian !
do you know the tale about him and count markóv ?
count markóv was the only man who knew how to handle him .
you know the story of the handkerchief ?
it is delightful ! and the talkative dolgorúkov , turning now to borís , now to prince andrew , told how bonaparte wishing to test markóv , our ambassador , purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at markóv , probably expecting markóv to pick it up for him , and how markóv immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching bonaparte s .
delightful ! said bolkónski .
but i have come to you , prince , as a petitioner on behalf of this young man .
you see but before prince andrew could finish , an came in to summon dolgorúkov to the emperor .
oh , what a nuisance , said dolgorúkov , getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of prince andrew and borís .
you know i should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of , sincere , and animated levity .
but you see another time ! borís was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment .
he was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny , obedient , and insignificant atom .
they followed prince dolgorúkov out into the corridor and out of the door of the emperor s room by which dolgorúkov had short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which , without spoiling his face , gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression .
this short man nodded to dolgorúkov as to an intimate friend and stared at prince andrew with cool intensity , walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way .
prince andrew did neither a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor .
who was that ? asked borís .
he is one of the most remarkable , but to me most unpleasant of minister of foreign affairs , prince adam czartorýski
it is such men as he who decide the fate of nations , added bolkónski with a sigh he could not suppress , as they passed out of the palace .
next day , the army began its campaign , and up to the very battle of austerlitz , borís was unable to see either prince andrew or dolgorúkov again and remained for a while with the ismáylov regiment .
at dawn on the sixteenth of november , denísov s squadron , in which nicholas rostóv served and which was in prince bagratión s detachment , moved from the place where it had spent the night , advancing into action as arranged , and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad .
rostóv saw the cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then generals bagratión and dolgorúkov ride past with their adjutants .
all the fear before action which he had experienced as previously , all the inner struggle to conquer that fear , all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle , had been wasted .
their squadron remained in reserve and nicholas rostóv spent that day in a dull and wretched mood .
at nine in the morning , he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah , and saw wounded being brought back ( there were not many of them ) , and at last he saw how a whole detachment of french cavalry was brought in , convoyed by a sótnya of cossacks .
evidently the affair was over and , though not big , had been a successful engagement .
the men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory , of the occupation of the town of wischau and the capture of a whole french squadron .
the day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost , and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed , not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it , but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers , officers , generals , and adjutants , as they passed rostóv going or coming .
and nicholas , who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity , was all the more depressed .
come here , wostóv .
let s dwink to dwown our gwief ! shouted denísov , who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food .
the officers gathered round denísov s canteen , eating and talking .
there !
they are bringing another ! cried one of the officers , indicating a captive french dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two cossacks .
one of them was leading by the bridle a fine large french horse he had taken from the prisoner .
sell us that horse ! denísov called out to the cossacks .
if you like , your honor ! the officers got up and stood round the cossacks and their prisoner .
the french dragoon was a young alsatian who spoke french with a german accent .
he was breathless with agitation , his face was red , and when he heard some french spoken he at once began speaking to the officers , addressing first one , then another .
he said he would not have been taken , it was not his fault but the corporal s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths , though he had told him the russians were there .
and at every word he added but don t hurt my little horse ! and stroked the animal .
