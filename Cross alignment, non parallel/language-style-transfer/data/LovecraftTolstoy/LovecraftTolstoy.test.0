look at it any way i could , it seemed to be a rather bad business .
but matters got started just the same .
denis fixed up an attic room with skylights , and marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment .
everyone was rather excited about the new venture , and i was at least glad that something was on foot to break the brooding tension .
soon the sittings began , and we all took them quite seriously for we could see that marsh regarded them as important artistic events .
denny and i used to go quietly about the house as though something sacred were occurring , and we knew that it was sacred as far as marsh was concerned .
with marceline , though , it was a different matter , as i began to see at once .
whatever marsh reactions to the sittings may have been , hers were painfully obvious .
every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace infatuation for the artist , and would repulse denis ' marks of affection whenever she dared .
oddly , i noticed this more vividly than denis himself , and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boy mind easy until the matter could be straightened out .
there was no use in having him excited about it if it could be helped .
in the end i decided that denis had better be away while the disagreeable situation existed .
i could represent his interests well enough at this end , and sooner or later marsh would finish the picture and go .
my view of marsh honour was such that i did not look for any worse developments .
when the matter had blown over , and marceline had forgotten about her new infatuation , it would be time enough to have denis on hand again .
so i wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in new york , and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite time .
i had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one of us to go east , and of course my illness made it clear that i could not be the one .
it was arranged that when denis got to new york he would find enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as i thought he ought to be away .
the plan worked perfectly , and denis started for new york without the least suspicion ; marceline and marsh going with him in the car to cape girardeau , where he caught the afternoon train to louis .
they returned after dark , and as mccabe drove the car back to the stables i could hear them talking on the veranda in those same chairs near the long parlour window where marsh and denis had sat when i overheard them talk about the portrait .
this time i resolved to do some intentional eavesdropping , so quietly went down to the front parlour and stretched out on the sofa near the window .
at first i could not hear anything but very shortly there came the sound of a chair being shifted , followed by a short , sharp breath and a sort of inarticulately hurt exclamation from marceline .
then i heard marsh speaking in a strained , almost formal voice .
' i enjoy working tonight if you are too tired . '
marceline reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her exclamation .
she used english as he had done .
, frank , is that really all you care about ?
forever working !
ca we just sit out here in this glorious moonlight ? '
he answered impatiently , his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm .
!
good god , what cheap sentimentality !
for a supposedly sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap that ever escaped from the dime novels !
with art at your elbow , you have to think of the moon cheap as a spotlight at the varieties !
or perhaps it makes you think of the roodmas dance around the stone pillars at auteiul .
hell , how you used to make those yaps stare !
but not i suppose you dropped all that now .
no more atlantean magic or rites for madame de russy !
i the only one to remember the ld things the things that came down through the temples of tanit and echoed on the ramparts of zimbabwe .
but i wo be cheated of that remembrance all that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvas the thing that is going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of years . '
marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions .
you who are cheaply sentimental now !
you know well that the old things had better be let alone .
all of you had better watch out if ever i chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in yuggoth , zimbabwe , and .
i thought you had more sense !
lack logic .
you want me to be interested in this precious painting of yours , yet you never let me see what you doing .
always that black cloth over it !
it of me i should think it would matter if i saw it . '
marsh was interrupting this time , his voice curiously hard and strained .
.
not now .
you see it in due course of time .
you say it of you yes , it that , but it more .
if you knew , you might be so impatient .
poor denis !
my god , it a shame ! '
my throat was suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch .
what could marsh mean ?
suddenly i saw that he had stopped and was entering the house alone .
i heard the front door slam , and listened as his footsteps ascended the stairs .
outside on the veranda i could still hear marceline heavy , angry breathing .
i crept away sick at heart , feeling that there were grave things to ferret out before i could safely let denis come back .
after that evening the tension around the place was even worse than before .
marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock of those few blunt words from marsh was too much for her temperament .
there was no living in the house with her anymore , for with poor denis gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody .
when she could find no one indoors to quarrel with she would go out to sophonisba cabin and spend hours talking with the queer old zulu woman .
aunt sophy was the only person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her , and when i tried once to overhear their conversation i found marceline whispering about secrets ' and kadath ' while the negress rocked to and fro in her chair , making inarticulate sounds of reverence and admiration every now and then .
but nothing could break her infatuation for marsh .
she would talk bitterly and sullenly to him , yet was getting more and more obedient to his wishes .
it was very convenient for him , since he now became able to make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting .
he tried to shew gratitude for this willingness , but i thought i could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing beneath his careful politeness .
for my part , i frankly hated marceline !
there was no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as dislike these days .
certainly , i was glad denis was away .
his letters , not nearly so frequent as i wished , shewed signs of strain and worry .
as the middle of august went by i gathered from marsh remarks that the portrait was nearly done .
his mood seemed increasingly sardonic , though marceline temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing tickled her vanity .
i can still recall the day when marsh said he have everything finished within a week .
marceline brightened up perceptibly , though not without a venomous look at me .
it seemed as if her coiled hair visibly tightened around her head .
' i to be the first to see it ! '
she snapped .
then , smiling at marsh , she said , if i do like it i shall slash it to pieces ! '
marsh face took on the most curious look i have ever seen it wear as he answered her .
' i ca vouch for your taste , marceline , but i swear it will be magnificent !
not that i want to take much credit art creates itself and this thing had to be done .
just wait ! '
during the next few days i felt a queer sense of foreboding , as if the completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief .
denis , too , had not written me , and my agent in new york said he was planning some trip to the country .
i wondered what the outcome of the whole thing would be .
what a queer mixture of elements marsh and marceline , denis and i !
how would all these ultimately react on one another ?
when my fears grew too great i tried to lay them all to my infirmity , but that explanation never quite satisfied me .
well , the thing exploded on tuesday , the of august .
i had risen at my usual time and had breakfast , but was not good for much because of the pain in my spine .
it had been troubling me badly of late , and forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable ; nobody else was downstairs except the servants , though i could hear marceline moving about in her room .
marsh slept in the attic next his studio , and had begun to keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon .
about ten the pain got the better of me , so that i took a double dose of my opiate and lay down on the parlour sofa .
the last i heard was marceline pacing overhead .
poor creature if i had known !
she must have been walking before the long mirror admiring herself .
that was like her .
vain from start to finish revelling in her own beauty , just as she revelled in all the little luxuries denis was able to give her .
i did wake up till near sunset , and knew instantly how long i had slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the long window .
nobody was about , and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over everything .
from afar , though , i thought i could sense a faint howling , wild and intermittent , whose quality had a slight but baffling familiarity about it .
i not much for psychic premonitions , but i was frightfully uneasy from the start .
there had been dreams even worse than the ones i had been dreaming in the weeks before and this time they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality .
the whole place had a poisonous air .
afterward i reflected that certain sounds must have filtered through into my unconscious brain during those hours of drugged sleep .
my pain , though , was very much eased ; and i rose and walked without difficulty .
soon enough i began to see that something was wrong .
marsh and marceline might have been riding , but someone ought to have been getting dinner in the kitchen .
instead , there was only silence , except for that faint , distant howl or wail ; and nobody answered when i pulled the to summon scipio .
then , chancing to look up , i saw the spreading stain on the ceiling the bright red stain , that must have come through the floor of marceline room .
in an instant i forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out the worst .
everything under the sun raced through my mind as i struggled with the door of that silent chamber , and most hideous of all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness .
i had , it struck me , known all along that nameless horrors were gathering ; that something profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a under my roof from which only blood and tragedy could result .
the door gave at last , and i stumbled into the large room beyond all dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows .
for a moment i could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately struck my nostrils .
then , turning on the electric light and glancing around , i glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue rug .
it lay face down in a great pool of dark , thickened blood , and had the gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back .
blood was spattered everywhere on the walls , furniture , and floor .
my knees gave way as i took in the sight , so that i had to stumble to a chair and slump down .
the thing had obviously been a human being , though its identity was not easy to establish at first ; since it was without clothes , and had most of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a very crude way .
it was of a deep ivory colour , and i knew that it must have been marceline .
the on the back made the thing seem all the more hellish .
i could not even picture the strange , loathsome tragedy which must have taken place while i slept in the room below .
when i raised my hand to wipe my dripping forehead i saw that my fingers were sticky with blood .
i shuddered , then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door which the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left .
he had taken his weapon with him , it seemed , for no instrument of death was visible here .
as i studied the floor i saw that a line of sticky footprints like the one on the body led away from the horror to the door .
there was another , too , and of a less easily explainable kind ; a broadish , continuous line , as if marking the path of some huge snake .
at first i concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after him .
then , noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be superimposed on it , i was forced to believe that it could have been there when the murderer left .
but what crawling entity could have been in that room with the victim and her assassin , leaving before the killer when the deed was done ?
as i asked myself this question i thought i heard fresh bursts of that faint , distant wailing .
finally , rousing myself from a lethargy of horror , i got on my feet again and began following the footprints .
who the murderer was , i could not even faintly guess , nor could i try to explain the absence of the servants .
i vaguely felt that i ought to go up to marsh attic quarters , but before i had fully formulated the idea i saw that the bloody trail was indeed taking me there .
was he himself the murderer ?
had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and suddenly run amok ?
in the attic corridor the trail became faint , the prints almost ceasing as they merged with the dark carpet .
i could still , however , discern the strange single path of the entity who had gone first ; and this led straight to the closed door of marsh studio , disappearing beneath it at a point about half way from side to side .
evidently it had crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide open .
sick at heart , i tried the knob and found the door unlocked .
opening it , i paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be awaiting me .
there was certainly something human on the floor , and i reached for the switch to turn on the chandelier .
but as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horror that was marsh , poor devil to fix itself frantically and incredulously upon the living thing that cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to marsh bedroom .
it was a tousled , thing , crusted with dried blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall .
yet even in that awful moment i recognised it as one whom i had thought more than a thousand miles away .
it was my own boy denis or the maddened wreck which had once been denis .
the sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity or at least of memory in the poor boy .
he straightened up and began to toss his head about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence .
i could not speak a word , but moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice .
my eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in front of the heavily draped easel the figure toward which the strange led , and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some dark , ropy object .
the shifting of my glance apparently produced some impression in the twisted brain of the boy , for suddenly he began to mutter in a hoarse whisper whose purport i was soon able to catch .
' i had to exterminate her she was the devil the summit and of all evil the spawn of the pit marsh knew , and tried to warn me .
good old frank i did kill him , though i was ready to before i realised .
but i went down there and killed her then that cursed hair ' i listened in horror as denis choked , paused , and began again .
did know her letters got queer and i knew she was in love with marsh .
then she nearly stopped writing .
he never mentioned her i felt something was wrong , and thought i ought to come back and find out .
could tell you your manner would have given it away .
wanted to surprise them .
got here about noon today came in a cab and sent the all off let the field hands alone , for their cabins are all out of earshot .
told mccabe to get me some things in cape girardeau and not bother to come back until tomorrow .
had all the niggers take the old car and let mary drive them to bend village for a vacation told we were all going on some sort of outing and would need help .
said they better stay all night with uncle scip cousin , who keeps that nigger boarding house . '
denis was getting very incoherent now , and i strained my ears to grasp every word .
again i thought i heard that wild , wail , but the story had first place for the present .
you sleeping in the parlour , and took a chance you would wake up .
then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up marsh and that woman ! '
the boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing marceline name .
at the same time i saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant crying , whose vague familiarity had now become very great .
was not in her room , so i went up to the studio .
door was shut , and i could hear voices inside .
did knock just burst in and found her posing for the picture .
nude , but with the hellish hair all draped around her .
and making all sorts of sheep eyes at marsh .
he had the easel turned half away from the door , so i could see the picture .
both of them were pretty well jolted when i shewed up , and marsh dropped his brush .
i was in a rage and told him he have to shew me the portrait , but he got calmer every minute .
told me it was quite done , but would be in a day or two said i could see it then she had seen it .
that did go with me .
i stepped up , and he dropped a velvet curtain over the thing before i could see it .
he was ready to fight before letting me see it , but that that she stepped up and sided with me .
said we ought to see it .
frank got horrible worked up , and gave me a punch when i tried to get at the curtain .
i punched back and seemed to have knocked him out .
then i was almost knocked out myself by the shriek that that creature gave .
she drawn aside the hangings herself , and caught a look at what marsh had been painting .
i wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the room then i saw the picture . '
madness flared up in the boy eyes again as he got to this place , and i thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete .
but after a pause he partly steadied himself .
, god that thing !
do ever look at it !
burn it with the hangings around it and throw the ashes into the river !
marsh knew and was warning me .
he knew what it was what that woman that leopardess , or gorgon , or lamia , or whatever she was actually represented .
he tried to hint to me ever since i met her in his paris studio , but it could be told in words .
i thought they all wronged her when they whispered horrors about her she had me hypnotised so that i could believe the plain facts but this picture has caught the whole secret the whole monstrous background !
, but frank is an artist !
that thing is the greatest piece any living soul has produced since rembrandt !
it a crime to burn it but it would be a greater crime to let it exist just as it would have been an abhorrent sin to let that exist any longer .
the minute i saw it i understood what she was , and what part she played in the frightful secret that has come down from the days of cthulhu and the elder ones the secret that was nearly wiped out when atlantis sank , but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and furtive , midnight .
for you know she was the real thing .
it was any fake .
it would have been merciful if it had been a fake .
it was the old , hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention the thing hinted at in the necronomicon and symbolised in the easter island colossi .
thought we could see through that the false front would hold till we had bartered away our immortal souls .
and she was half right she have got me in the end .
she was only waiting .
but frank good old frank was too much for me .
he knew what it all meant , and painted it .
i do wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw it .
it was quite done , but god knows enough was there .
i knew i got to kill her kill her , and everything connected with her .
it was a taint that wholesome human blood could bear .
there was something else , too but you never know that if you burn the picture without looking .
i staggered down to her room with this machete that i got off the wall here , leaving frank still knocked out .
he was breathing , though , and i knew and thanked heaven i had killed him .
' i found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair .
she turned on me like a wild beast , and began spitting out her hatred of marsh .
the fact that she been in love with him and i knew she had only made it worse .
for a minute i could move , and she came within an ace of completely hypnotising me .
then i thought of the picture , and the spell broke .
she saw the breaking in my eyes , and must have noticed the machete , too .
i never saw anything give such a wild jungle beast look as she did then .
she sprang for me with claws out like a leopard , but i was too quick .
i swung the machete , and it was all over . '
denis had to stop again , and i saw the perspiration running down his forehead through the spattered blood .
but in a moment he hoarsely resumed .
' i said it was all over but god !
some of it had only just begun !
i felt i had fought the legions of satan , and put my foot on the back of the thing i had annihilated .
then i saw that blasphemous braid of coarse black hair begin to twist and squirm of itself .
' i might have known it .
it was all in the old tales .
that damnable hair had a life of its own , that could be ended by killing the creature itself .
i knew i have to burn it , so i started to hack it off with the machete .
god , but it was devilish work !
tough like iron wires but i managed to do it .
and it was loathsome the way the big braid writhed and struggled in my grasp .
the time i had the last strand cut or pulled off i heard that eldritch wailing from behind the house .
you know it still going off and on .
i do know what it is , but it must be something springing from this hellish business .
it half seems like something i ought to know but ca quite place .
it got my nerves the first time i heard it , and i dropped the severed braid in my fright .
then , i got a worse fright for in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of grotesque head .
i struck out with the machete , and it turned away .
then , when i had my breath again , i saw that the monstrous thing was crawling along the floor by itself like a great black snake .
i could do anything for a while , but when it vanished through the door i managed to pull myself together and stumble after it .
i could follow the broad , bloody trail , and i saw it led upstairs .
it brought me here and may heaven curse me if i did see it through the doorway , striking at poor dazed marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck at me , finally coiling around him as a python would .
he had begun to come to , but that abominable serpent got him before he was on his feet .
i knew that all of the woman hatred was behind it , but i had the power to pull it off .
i tried , but it was too much for me .
even the machete was no good i could swing it freely or it would have slashed frank to pieces .
so i saw those monstrous coils tighten saw poor frank crushed to death before my eyes and all the time that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields .
all .
i pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope it never be lifted .
the thing must be burnt .
i could pry the coils off poor , dead frank they cling to him like a leech , and seem to have lost their motion altogether .
it as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killed it clinging to him embracing him .
you have to burn poor frank with it but for god sake do forget to see it in ashes .
that and the picture .
they must both go .
the safety of the world demands that they go .
denis might have whispered more , but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut us short .
for the first time we knew what it was , for a westerly veering wind brought articulate words at last .
we ought to have known long before , since sounds much like it had often come from the same source .
it was wrinkled sophonisba , the ancient zulu who had fawned on marceline , keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of this nightmare tragedy .
we could both hear some of the things she howled , and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of elder secrets who had just been extirpated .
some of the words she used betrayed her closeness to daemonic and palaeogean traditions .
!
iä !
!
!
bwana !
ya , yo , poor missy tanit , poor missy isis !
marse clooloo , come up outen de water an ' git yo chile she done daid !
she done daid !
de hair ain ' got no missus no mo ' , marse clooloo .
ol ' sophy , she know !
ol ' sophy , she done got de black stone outen big zimbabwe in ol ' affriky !
ol ' sophy , she done dance in de moonshine roun ' de befo ' de cotch her and sell her to de ship folks !
no mo ' tanit !
no mo ' isis !
no mo ' to keep de fire ' in de big stone place !
ya , yo !
bwana !
iä !
!
she daid !
ol ' sophy know ! '
that was the end of the wailing , but it was all i could pay attention to .
the expression on my boy face shewed that it had reminded him of something frightful , and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded no good .
i knew he was desperate , and sprang to disarm him before he could do anything more .
but i was too late .
an old man with a bad spine does count for much physically .
there was a terrible struggle , but he had done for himself before many seconds were over .
i not sure yet but that he tried to kill me , too .
his last panting words were something about the need of wiping out everything that had been connected with marceline , either by blood or marriage .
i wonder to this day that i did go stark mad in that instant or in the moments and hours afterward .
in front of me was the slain body of my boy the only human being i had to cherish and ten feet away , in front of that shrouded easel , was the body of his best friend , with a nameless coil of horror wound around it .
below was the scalped corpse of that , about whom i was to believe anything .
i was too dazed to analyse the probability of the hair story and even if i had not been , that dismal howling coming from aunt sophy cabin would have been enough to quiet doubt for the nonce .
if i been wise , i have done just what poor denis told me to burned the picture and the hair at once and without curiosity but i was too shaken to be wise .
i suppose i muttered foolish things over my boy and then i remembered that the night was wearing on and that the servants would be back in the morning .
it was plain that a matter like this could never be explained , and i knew that i must cover things up and invent a story .
that coil of hair around marsh was a monstrous thing .
as i poked at it with a sword which i took from the wall i almost thought i felt it tighten its grip on the dead man .
i did dare touch it and the longer i looked at it the more horrible things i noticed about it .
one thing gave me a start .
i wo mention it but it partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as marceline had always done .
in the end i decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar with quicklime , which i knew we had in the storehouse .
it was a night of hellish work .
i dug three graves my boy a long way from the other two , for i did want him to be near either the woman body or her hair .
i was sorry i could get the coil from around poor marsh .
it was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar .
i used blankets in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him .
then i had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse .
god must have given me strength , for i not only moved them but filled all three graves without a hitch .
some of the lime i made into whitewash .
i had to take a stepladder and fix over the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through .
and i burned nearly everything in marceline room , scrubbing the walls and floor and heavy furniture .
i washed up the attic studio , too , and the trail and footprints that led there .
and all the time i could hear old sophy wailing in the distance .
the devil must have been in that creature to let her voice go on like that .
but she always was howling queer things .
that why the field niggers did get scared or curious that night .
i locked the studio door and took the key to my room .
then i burned all my stained clothes in the fireplace .
by dawn the whole house looked quite normal so far as any casual eye could tell .
i had dared touch the covered easel , but meant to attend to that later .
well , the servants came back the next day , and i told them all the young folks had gone to louis .
none of the field hands seemed to have seen or heard anything , and old sophonisba wailing had stopped at the instant of sunrise .
she was like a sphinx after that , and never let out a word of what had been on her brooding brain the day and night before .
later on i pretended that denis and marsh and marceline had gone back to paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from there letters i had fixed up in forged handwriting .
it took a good deal of deceit and reticence in several things to various friends , and i knew people have secretly suspected me of holding something back .
i had the deaths of marsh and denis reported during the war , and later said marceline had entered a convent .
fortunately marsh was an orphan whose eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in louisiana .
things might have been patched up a good deal better for me if i had had the sense to burn the picture , sell the plantation , and give up trying to manage things with a shaken and overstrained mind .
you see what my folly has brought me to .
failing crops hands discharged one by one place falling apart to ruin and myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside stories .
nobody will come around here after dark anymore or any other time if it can be helped .
that why i knew you must be a stranger .
and why do i stay here ?
i ca wholly tell you that .
it bound up too closely with things at the very rim of sane reality .
it would have been so , perhaps , if i had looked at the picture .
i ought to have done as poor denis told me .
i honestly meant to burn it when i went up to that locked studio a week after the horror , but i looked first and that changed everything .
no there no use telling what i saw .
you can , in a way , see for yourself presently ; though time and dampness have done their work .
i do think it can hurt you if you want to take a look , but it was different with me .
i knew too much of what it all meant .
denis had been right it was the greatest triumph of human art since rembrandt , even though still unfinished .
i grasped that at the start , and knew that poor marsh had justified his decadent philosophy .
he was to painting what baudelaire was to poetry and marceline was the key that had unlocked his inmost stronghold of genius .
the thing almost stunned me when i pulled aside the hangings stunned me before i half knew what the whole thing was .
you know , it only partly a portrait .
marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he was painting marceline alone , but what he saw through her and beyond her .
of course she was in it was the key to it , in a sense but her figure only formed one point in a vast composition .
she was nude except for that hideous web of hair spun around her , and was , on a sort of bench or divan , carved in patterns unlike those of any known decorative tradition .
there was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand , from which was spilling fluid whose colour i have been able to place or classify to this day i do know where marsh even got the pigments .
the figure and the divan were in the foreground of the strangest sort of scene i ever saw in my life .
i think there was a faint suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the woman brain , yet there was also a directly opposite suggestion as if she were just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itself .
i ca tell you know whether it an exterior or an interior whether those hellish cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside , or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous arborescence .
the geometry of the whole thing is crazy one gets the acute and obtuse angles all mixed up .
and god !
the shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual daemon twilight !
the blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a witches ' sabbat with that woman as a !
the black shaggy entities that are not quite goats the beast with three legs and a dorsal row of tentacles and the egyptians dancing in a pattern that egypt priests knew and called accursed !
but the scene was egypt it was behind egypt ; behind even atlantis ; behind fabled mu , and myth whispered lemuria .
it was the ultimate fountainhead of all horror on this earth , and the symbolism shewed only too clearly how integral a part of it marceline was .
i think it must be the unmentionable , that was not built by any creatures of this planet the thing marsh and denis used to talk about in the shadows with hushed voices .
in the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep under water though everybody seems to be breathing freely .
well i could do anything but look and shudder , and finally i saw that marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous , dilated eyes on the canvas .
it was no mere superstition marsh had actually caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and color , so that she still brooded and hated , just as if most of her were down in the cellar under quicklime .
and it was worst of all when some of those snaky strands of hair began to lift themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward me .
then it was that i knew the last final horror , and realised i was a guardian and a prisoner forever .
she was the thing from which the first dim legends of medusa and the gorgons had sprung , and something in my shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last .
never again would i be safe from those coiling snaky strands the strands in the picture , and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine casks .
all too late i recalled the tales of the virtual indestructibility , even through centuries of burial , of the hair of the dead .
my life since has been nothing but horror and slavery .
always there had lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar .
in less than a month the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that crawled around near the wine casks after dark , and about the curious way its trail would lead to another spot six feet away .
finally i had to move everything to another part of the cellar , for not a darky could be induced to go near the place where the snake was seen .
then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old sophonisba cabin every night after midnight .
one of them shewed me its trail and not long afterward i found out that aunt sophy herself had begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house , lingering and muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the other blacks would go near .
god , but i was glad when that old witch died !
i honestly believe she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible tradition back in africa .
she must have lived to be almost a hundred and fifty years old .
sometimes i think i hear something gliding around the house at night .
there will be a queer noise on the stairs , where the boards are loose , and the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure .
i always keep my door locked , of course .
then there are certain mornings when i seem to catch a sickish musty odour in the corridors , and notice a faint , ropy trail through the dust of the floors .
i know i must guard the hair in the picture , for if anything were to happen to it , there are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible revenge .
i do even dare to die for life and death are all one to those in the clutch of what came out of .
something would be on hand to punish my neglect .
medusa coil has got me , and it will always be the same .
never mix up with secret and ultimate horror , young man , if you value your immortal soul .
as the old man finished his story i saw that the small lamp had long since burned dry , and that the large one was nearly empty .
it must , i knew , be near dawn , and my ears told me that the storm was over .
the tale had held me in a , and i almost feared to glance at the door lest it reveal an inward pressure from some unnamable source .
it would be hard to say which had the greatest hold on me stark horror , incredulity , or a kind of morbid fantastic curiosity .
i was wholly beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to break the spell .
do you want to see the thing ?
his voice was low and hesitant , and i saw he was tremendously in earnest .
of my various emotions , curiosity gained the upper hand ; and i nodded silently .
he rose , lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high before him as he opened the door .
come with me upstairs .
i dreaded to brave those musty corridors again , but fascination downed all my qualms .
the boards creaked beneath our feet , and i trembled once when i thought i saw a faint , line trace in the dust near the staircase .
the steps of the attic were noisy and rickety , with several of the treads missing .
i was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing , for it gave me an excuse not to glance about .
the attic corridor was and heavily cobwebbed , and with dust except where a beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther end .
as i noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet i thought of the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decades of these , and of one thing which did not have feet .
the old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path , and fumbled a second with the rusty latch .
i was acutely frightened now that i knew the picture was so close , yet dared not retreat at this stage .
in another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted studio .
the candle light was very faint , yet served to shew most of the principal features .
i noticed the low , slanting roof , the huge enlarged dormer , the curios and trophies hung on the wall and most of all , the great shrouded easel in the centre of the floor .
to that easel de russy now walked , drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned away from me , and motioning me silently to approach .
it took a good deal of courage to make me obey , especially when i saw how my guide eyes dilated in the wavering candle light as he looked at the unveiled canvas .
but again curiosity conquered everything , and i walked around to where de russy stood .
then i saw the damnable thing .
i did not faint though no reader can possibly realise the effort it took to keep me from doing so .
i did cry out , but stopped short when i saw the frightened look on the old man face .
as i had expected , the canvas was warped , mouldy , and scabrous from dampness and neglect ; but for all that i could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scene morbid content and perverted geometry .
it was as the old man had said a vaulted , columned hell of mumbled black masses and witches ' sabbaths and what perfect completion could have added to it was beyond my power to guess .
decay had only increased the utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion , for the parts most affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in nature or in the realm that mocked nature would be apt to decay and disintegrate .
the utmost horror of all , of course , was marceline and as i saw the bloated , discoloured flesh i formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure on the canvas had some obscure , occult linkage with the figure which lay in quicklime under the cellar floor .
perhaps the lime had preserved the corpse instead of destroying it but could it have preserved those black , malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from their painted hell ?
and there was something else about the creature which i could not fail to notice something which de russy had not been able to put into words , but which perhaps had something to do with denis ' wish to kill all those of his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her .
whether marsh knew , or whether the genius in him painted it without his knowing , none could say .
but denis and his father could not have known till they saw the picture .
surpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair which covered the rotting body , but which was itself not even slightly decayed .
all i had heard of it was amply verified .
it was nothing human , this ropy , sinuous , , flood of serpent darkness .
vile , independent life proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and convolution , and the suggestion of numberless reptilian heads at the ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidental .
the blasphemous thing held me like a magnet .
i was helpless , and did not wonder at the myth of the gorgon glance which turned all beholders to stone .
then i thought i saw a change come over the thing .
the leering features perceptibly moved , so that the rotting jaw fell , allowing the thick , lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs .
the pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated , and the eyes themselves seemed to bulge outward .
and the hair that accursed hair !
it had begun to rustle and wave perceptibly , the all turning toward de russy and vibrating as if to strike !
reason deserted me altogether , and before i knew what i was doing i drew my automatic and sent a shower of twelve bullets through the shocking canvas .
the whole thing at once fell to pieces , even the frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the floor .
but though this horror was shattered , another had risen before me in the form of de russy himself , whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as the picture itself had been .
with a scream of god , now you done it !
the frantic old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the room and down the rickety stairs .
he had dropped the candle in his panic ; but dawn was near , and some faint grey light was filtering in through the windows .
i tripped and stumbled repeatedly , but never for a moment would my guide slacken his pace .
run !
he shrieked , run for your life !
you do know what you done !
i never told you the whole thing !
there were things i had to do the picture talked to me and told me .
i had to guard and keep it now the worst will happen !
she and that hair will come up out of their graves , for god knows what purpose !
hurry , man !
for god sake let get out of here while there time .
if you have a car take me along to cape girardeau with you .
it may well get me in the end , anywhere , but i give it a run for its money .
out of here quick !
as we reached the ground floor i became aware of a slow , curious thumping from the rear of the house , followed by a sound of a door shutting .
de russy had not heard the thumping , but the other noise caught his ear and drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throat .
oh , god great god that was the cellar door she coming by this time i was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging hinges of the great front door almost as frantic as my host now that i heard the slow , thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of the accursed mansion .
the night rain had warped the oaken planks , and the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when i forced an entrance the evening before .
somewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking , and the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man .
with a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a plunge to the right , through the open door of a room which i judged had been a parlour .
a second later , just as i got the front door open and was making my own escape , i heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and knew he had leapt through a window .
and as i bounded off the sagging porch to commence my mad race down the long , drive i thought i could catch the thud of dead , dogged footsteps which did not follow me , but which kept leadenly on through the door of the cobwebbed parlour .
i looked backward only twice as i plunged heedlessly through the burrs and briers of that abandoned drive , past the dying lindens and grotesque , in the grey pallor of a cloudy november dawn .
the first time was when an acrid smell overtook me , and i thought of the candle de russy had dropped in the attic studio .
by then i was comfortably near the road , on the high place from which the roof of the distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees ; and just as i expected , thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and curling upward into the leaden heavens .
i thanked the powers of creation that an immemorial curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earth .
but in the next instant came that second backward look in which i glimpsed two other things things that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a supreme shock from which i shall never recover .
i have said that i was on a high part of the drive , from which much of the plantation behind me was visible .
this vista included not only the house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly flooded land beside the river , and several bends of the drive i had been so hastily traversing .
in both of these latter places i now beheld sights or suspicions of sights which i wish devoutly i could deny .
it was a faint , distant scream which made me turn back again , and as i did so i caught a trace of motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the house .
at that human figures are very small , yet i thought the motion resolved itself into two of these pursuer and pursued .
i even thought i saw the leading figure overtaken , seized , and dragged violently in the direction of the now burning house .
but i could not watch the outcome , for at once a nearer sight obtruded itself a suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some distance back along the deserted drive .
unmistakably , the weeds and bushes and briers were swaying as no wind could sway them ; swaying as if some large , swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the ground in pursuit of me .
that was all i could stand .
i scrambled along madly for the gate , heedless of torn clothing and bleeding scratches , and jumped into the roadster parked under the great evergreen tree .
it was a bedraggled , sight ; but the works were unharmed and i had no trouble in starting the thing .
i went on blindly in the direction the car was headed for nothing was in my mind but to get away from that frightful region of nightmares and cacodaemons to get away as quickly and as far as gasoline could take me .
about three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me a kindly , drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence .
i was glad to slow down and ask directions , though i knew i must present a strange enough aspect .
the man readily told me the way to cape girardeau , and inquired where i had come from in such a state at such an early hour .
thinking it best to say little , i merely mentioned that i had been caught in the night rain and had taken shelter at a nearby farmhouse , afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying to find my car .
at a farmhouse , eh ?
wonder whose it could ' a been .
ai nothin ' standin ' this side o ' jim ferris ' place acrost barker crick , an ' that all o ' twenty miles by the rud .
i gave a start , and wondered what fresh mystery this portended .
then i asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house whose ancient gate bordered the road not far back .
funny ye sh recolleck that , stranger !
must a ben here afore some time .
but that house ai here now .
burnt down five or six years ago and they did tell some queer stories about it .
i shuddered .
you mean riverside ol ' man de russy place .
queer goin on there fifteen or twenty years ago .
ol ' man boy married a gal from abroad , and some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort .
did like the looks of her , then she and the boy went off sudden , and later on the ol ' man said he was kilt in the war .
but some o ' the niggers hinted queer things .
got around at last that the ol ' fellow fell in love with the gal himself and kilt her and the boy .
that place was sure enough haunted by a black snake , mean that what it may .
then five or six years ago the ol ' man disappeared and the house burned down .
some do say he was burnt up in it .
it was a mornin ' after a rainy night just like this , when lots o ' folks heard an awful yellin ' across the fields in old de russy voice .
when they stopped and looked , they see the house goin ' up in smoke quick as a wink that place was all like tinder anyhow , rain or no rain .
nobody never seen the ol ' man again , but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big black snake glidin ' aroun ' .
what d make of it , anyhow ?
you seem to hev knowed the place .
did ye ever hear tell of the de russys ?
what d reckon was the trouble with that gal young denis married ?
she kinder made everybody shiver and feel hateful , though ye could never tell why .
i was trying to think , but that process was almost beyond me now .
the house burned down years ago ?
then where , and under what conditions , had i passed the night ?
and why did i know what i knew of these things ?
even as i pondered i saw a hair on my coat sleeve the short , grey hair of an old man .
in the end i drove on without telling anything .
but did i hint that gossip was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much .
i made it clear as if from distant but authentic reports wafted among friends that if anyone was to blame for the trouble at riverside it was the woman , marceline .
she was not suited to missouri ways , i said , and it was too bad that denis had ever married her .
more i did not intimate , for i felt that the de russys , with their proudly cherished honour and high , sensitive spirits , would not wish me to say more .
they had borne enough , god knows , without the countryside guessing what a daemon of the pit what a gorgon of the elder blasphemies had come to flaunt their ancient and stainless name .
nor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me that horror which he must have learned , as i learned it , from details in the lost masterpiece of poor frank marsh .
it would be too hideous if they knew that the heiress of riverside the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artist skeleton in a grave beneath a charred foundation was faintly , subtly , yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of zimbabwe most primal grovellers .
no wonder she owned a link with that old for , though in deceitfully slight proportion , marceline was a negress .
in the valley of nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly , tearing a path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great .
and within the depths of the valley , where the light reaches not , move forms not meant to be beheld .
rank is the herbage on each slope , where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces , twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths , and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten hands .
and in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes , while in and out of deep writhe poison serpents and scaly things without a name .
vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss , and mighty were the walls from which they fell .
for all time did their builders erect them , and in sooth they yet serve nobly , for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitation .
at the very bottom of the valley lies the river than , whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds .
from hidden springs it rises , and to subterranean grottoes it flows , so that the daemon of the valley knows not why its waters are red , nor whither they are bound .
the genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the daemon of the valley , saying , i am old , and forget much .
tell me the deeds and aspect and name of them who built these things of stone .
and the daemon replied , i am memory , and am wise in lore of the past , but i too am old .
these beings were like the waters of the river than , not to be understood .
their deeds i recall not , for they were but of the moment .
their aspect i recall dimly , it was like to that of the little apes in the trees .
their name i recall clearly , for it rhymed with that of the river .
these beings of yesterday were called man .
so the genie flew back to the thin horned moon , and the daemon looked intently at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling courtyard .
nyarlathotep the crawling chaos i am the last i will tell the audient void
i do not recall distinctly when it began , but it was months ago .
the general tension was horrible .
to a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger ; a danger widespread and , such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night .
i recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces , and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard .
a sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land , and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places .
there was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons the autumn heat lingered fearsomely , and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown .
and it was then that nyarlathotep came out of egypt .
who he was , none could tell , but he was of the old native blood and looked like a pharaoh .
the fellahin knelt when they saw him , yet could not say why .
he said he had risen up out of the blackness of centuries , and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet .
into the lands of civilisation came nyarlathotep , swarthy , slender , and sinister , always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger .
he spoke much of the sciences of electricity and psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless , yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude .
men advised one another to see nyarlathotep , and shuddered .
and where nyarlathotep went , rest vanished ; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare .
never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem ; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours , that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale , pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges , and old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky .
i remember when nyarlathotep came to my city the great , the old , the terrible city of unnumbered crimes .
my friend had told me of him , and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations , and i burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries .
my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings ; and what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy , and in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes .
and i heard it hinted abroad that those who knew nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not .
it was in the hot autumn that i went through the night with the restless crowds to see nyarlathotep ; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room .
and shadowed on a screen , i saw hooded forms amidst ruins , and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments .
and i saw the world battling against blackness ; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space ; whirling , churning , struggling around the dimming , cooling sun .
then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators , and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than i can tell came out and squatted on the heads .
and when i , who was colder and more scientific than the rest , mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and static electricity , nyarlathotep drove us all out , down the dizzy stairs into the damp , hot , deserted midnight streets .
i screamed aloud that i was not afraid ; that i never could be afraid ; and others screamed with me for solace .
we swore to one another that the city was exactly the same , and still alive ; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again , and laughed at the queer faces we made .
i believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon , for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them .
once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass , with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run .
and again we saw a , lone , windowless , dilapidated , and almost on its side .
when we gazed around the horizon , we could not find the third tower by the river , and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top .
then we split up into narrow columns , each of which seemed drawn in a different direction .
one disappeared in a narrow alley to the left , leaving only the echo of a shocking moan .
another filed down a subway entrance , howling with a laughter that was mad .
my own column was sucked toward the open country , and presently i felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn ; for as we stalked out on the dark moor , we beheld around us the hellish of evil snows .
trackless , inexplicable snows , swept asunder in one direction only , where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls .
the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf .
i lingered behind , for the black rift in the snow was frightful , and i thought i had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished ; but my power to linger was slight .
as if beckoned by those who had gone before , i between the titanic snowdrifts , quivering and afraid , into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable .
screamingly sentient , dumbly delirious , only the gods that were can tell .
a sickened , sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands , and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation , corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities , charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low .
beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things ; columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness .
and through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled , maddening beating of drums , and thin , monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time ; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic , tenebrous ultimate gods the blind , voiceless , mindless gargoyles whose soul is nyarlathotep .
i know i more nervous than i was when you saw me last year , but you do need to hold a clinic over it .
there plenty of reason , god knows , and i fancy i lucky to be sane at all .
why the third degree ?
you did use to be so inquisitive .
well , if you must hear it , i do know why you should .
maybe you ought to , anyhow , for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard i begun to cut the art club and keep away from pickman .
now that he disappeared i go round to the club once in a while , but my nerves are what they were .
no , i do know what become of pickman , and i do like to guess .
you might have surmised i had some inside information when i dropped him and that why i do want to think where he gone .
let the police find what they can it wo be much , judging from the fact that they do know yet of the old north end place he hired under the name of peters .
i not sure that i could find it again myself not that i ever try , even in broad daylight !
yes , i do know , or am afraid i know , why he maintained it .
i coming to that .
and i think you understand before i through why i do tell the police .
they would ask me to guide them , but i could go back there even if i knew the way .
there was something there and now i ca use the subway or ( and you may as well have your laugh at this , too ) go down into cellars any more .
i should think you have known i did drop pickman for the same silly reasons that fussy old women like reid or joe minot or rosworth did .
morbid art does shock me , and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him , no matter what direction his work takes .
boston never had a greater painter than richard upton pickman .
i said it at first and i say it still , and i never swerved an inch , either , when he showed that feeding ' .
that , you remember , was when minot cut him .
you know , it takes profound art and profound insight into nature to turn out stuff like pickman .
any hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a witches ' sabbath or a portrait of the devil , but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true .
that because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright , and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness .
i do have to tell you why a fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap frontispiece merely makes us laugh .
there something those fellows catch beyond life that they able to make us catch for a second .
doré had it .
sime has it .
angarola of chicago has it .
and pickman had it as no man ever had it before or i hope to heaven ever will again .
do ask me what it is they see .
you know , in ordinary art , there all the difference in the world between the vital , breathing things drawn from nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule .
well , i should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models , or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in .
anyhow , he manages to turn out results that differ from the pretender dreams in just about the same way that the life painter results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence school cartoonist .
if i had ever seen what pickman saw but no !
here , let have a drink before we get any deeper .
god , i would be alive if i ever seen what that man if he was a man saw ; !
you recall that pickman forte was faces .
i do believe anybody since goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression .
and before goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on notre dame and mont .
they believed all sorts of things and maybe they saw all sorts of things , too , for the middle ages had some curious phases i remember your asking pickman yourself once , the year before you went away , wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions .
was that a nasty laugh he gave you ?
it was partly because of that laugh that reid dropped him .
reid , you know , had just taken up comparative pathology , and was full of pompous stuff ' about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom .
he said pickman repelled him more and more every day , and almost frightened him towards the last that the fellow features and expression were slowly developing in a way he did like ; in a way that was human .
he had a lot of talk about diet , and said pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree .
i suppose you told reid , if you and he had any correspondence over it , that he let pickman paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination .
i know i told him that myself then .
but keep in mind that i did drop pickman for anything like this .
on the contrary , my admiration for him kept growing ; for that feeding ' was a tremendous achievement .
as you know , the club would exhibit it , and the museum of fine arts would accept it as a gift ; and i can add that nobody would buy it , so pickman had it right in his house till he went .
now his father has it in salem you know pickman comes of old salem stock , and had a witch ancestor hanged in .
i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often , especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art .
probably it was his work which put the idea into my head , and anyhow , i found him a mine of data and suggestions when i came to develop it .
he showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about ; including some ink sketches that would , i verily believe , have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them .
before long i was pretty nearly a devotee , and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the danvers asylum .
my , coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him , made him get very confidential with me ; and one evening he hinted that if i were fairly and none too squeamish , he might show me something rather unusual something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house .
know , ' he said , are things that wo do for newbury street things that are out of place here , and that ca be conceived here , anyhow .
it my business to catch the overtones of the soul , and you wo find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land .
back bay is boston it is anything yet , because it had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits .
if there are any ghosts here , they the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a shallow cove ; and i want human ghosts the ghosts of beings highly organized enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what they saw .
place for an artist to live is the north end .
if any aesthete were sincere , he put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions .
god , man !
do you realize that places like that were merely made , but actually grew ?
generation after generation lived and felt and died there , and in days when people were afraid to live and fed and die .
do you know there was a mill on copp hill in , and that half the present streets were laid out by ?
i can show you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more ; houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder .
what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it ?
you call the salem witchcraft a delusion , but i wager my could have told you things .
they hanged her on gallows hill , with cotton mather looking sanctimoniously on .
mather , damn him , was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of this accursed cage of monotony i wish someone had laid a spell on him or sucked his blood in the night !
' i can show you a house he lived in , and i can show you another one he was afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk .
he knew things he did dare put into that stupid magnalia or that puerile wonders of the invisible world .
look here , do you know the whole north end once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other houses , and the burying ground , and the sea ?
let them prosecute and persecute above ground things went on every day that they could reach , and voices laughed at night that they could place !
, man , out of ten surviving houses built before and not moved since i wager that in eight i can show you something queer in the cellar .
there hardly a month that you do read of workmen finding arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old place as it comes down you could see one near henchman street from the elevated last year .
there were witches and what their spells summoned ; pirates and what they brought in from the sea ; smugglers ; privateers and i tell you , people knew how to live , and how to enlarge the bounds of life , in the old time !
this was the only world a bold and wise man could know faugh !
and to think of today in contrast , with such brains that even a club of supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the feelings of a beacon street !
only saving grace of the present is that it too damned stupid to question the past very closely .
what do maps and records and guide books really tell of the north end ?
bah !
at a guess i guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of prince street that are suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them .
and what do those dagoes know of their meaning ?
no , thurber , these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and with wonder and terror and escapes from the commonplace , and yet there not a living soul to understand or profit by them .
or rather , there only one living soul for i have been digging around in the past for nothing ; !
here , you interested in this sort of thing .
what if i told you that i got another studio up there , where i can catch the night spirit of antique horror and paint things that i could even think of in newbury street ?
naturally i do tell those cursed old maids at the club with reid , damn him , whispering even as it is that i a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution .
yes , thurber , i decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life , so i did some exploring in places where i had reason to know terror lives .
' i got a place that i do believe three living nordic men besides myself have ever seen .
it is so very far from the elevated as distance goes , but it centuries away as the soul goes .
i took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar one of the sort i told you about .
the shack almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there , and i hate to tell you how little i pay for it .
the windows are boarded up , but i like that all the better , since i do want daylight for what i do .
i paint in the cellar , where the inspiration is thickest , but i other rooms furnished on the ground floor .
a sicilian owns it , and i hired it under the name of peters .
, if you game , i take you there tonight .
i think you enjoy the pictures , for , as i said , i let myself go a bit there .
it no vast tour i sometimes do it on foot , for i do want to attract attention with a taxi in such a place .
we can take the shuttle at the south station for battery street , and after that the walk is much . '
well , eliot , there was much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight .
we changed to the elevated at the south station , and at about twelve had climbed down the steps at battery street and struck along the old waterfront past constitution wharf .
i did keep track of the cross streets , and ca tell you yet which it was we turned up , but i know it was greenough lane .
when we did turn , it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life , with gables , broken windows , and archaic chimneys that stood out against the moonlit sky .
i do believe there were three houses in sight that had been standing in cotton mather time certainly i glimpsed at least two with an overhang , and once i thought i saw a peaked of the almost forgotten pre gambrel type , though antiquarians tell us there are none left in boston .
from that alley , which had a dim light , we turned to the left into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all and in a minute made what i think was an bend towards the right in the dark .
not long after this pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian door that looked damnably worm eaten .
unlocking it , he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid panelling simple , of course , but thrillingly suggestive of the times of andros and phipps and the witchcraft .
then he took me through a door on the left , lighted an oil lamp , and told me to make myself at home .
now , eliot , i what the man in the street would call fairly boiled , ' but i confess that what i saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn .
they were his pictures , you know the ones he could paint or even show in newbury street and he was right when he said he had himself go . '
here have another drink i need one anyhow !
there no use in my trying to tell you what they were like , because the awful , the blasphemous horror , and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify .
there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime , none of the landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood .
the backgrounds were mostly old churchyards , deep woods , cliffs by the sea , brick tunnels , ancient panelled rooms , or simple vaults of masonry .
copp hill burying ground , which could not be many blocks away from this very house , was a favourite scene .
the madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the pickman morbid art was one of demoniac portraiture .
these figures were seldom completely human , but often approached humanity in varying degree .
most of the bodies , while roughly bipedal , had a forward slumping , and a vaguely canine cast .
the texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness .
ugh !
i can see them now !
their occupations well , do ask me to be too precise .
they were usually feeding i wo say on what .
they were sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages , and often appeared to be in battle over their prey or rather , their .
and what damnable expressiveness pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty !
occasionally the things were shown leaping through open windows at night , or squatting on the chests of sleepers , worrying at their throats .
one canvas showed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on gallows hill , whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs .
but do get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint .
i not a kid , and i seen much like this before .
it was the faces , eliot , those accursed faces , that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life !
by god , man , i verily believe they were alive !
that nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment , and his brush had been a wand .
give me that decanter , eliot !
there was one thing called lesson ' heaven pity me , that i ever saw it !
listen can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves ?
the price of a changeling , i suppose you know the old myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes they steal .
pickman was showing what happens to those stolen babes how they grow up and then i began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and figures .
he was , in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly and the degradedly human , establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution .
the were developed from mortals !
and no sooner had i wondered what he made of their own young as left with mankind in the form of changelings , than my eye caught a picture embodying that very thought .
it was that of an ancient puritan interior a heavily beamed room with lattice windows , a settle , and clumsy furniture , with the family sitting about while the father read from the scriptures .
every face but one showed nobility and reverence , but that one reflected the mockery of the pit .
it was that of a young man in years , and no doubt belonged to a supposed son of that pious father , but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things .
it was their changeling and in a spirit of supreme irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own .
by this time pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me ; asking me if i would care to see his studies . '
i had been able to give him much of my opinions i was too speechless with fright and loathing but i think he fully understood and felt highly complimented .
and now i want to assure you again , eliot , that i no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shows a bit of departure from the usual .
i and decently sophisticated , and i guess you saw enough of me in france to know i not easily knocked out .
remember , too , that i just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial new england into a kind of annex of hell .
well , in spite of all this , that next room forced a real scream out of me , and i had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over .
the other chamber had shown a pack of ghouls and witches the world of our forefathers , but this one brought the horror right into our own daily life !
god , how that man could paint !
there was a study called accident , ' in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the boston street subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform .
another showed a dance on copp hill among the tombs with the background of today .
then there were any number of cellar views , with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend the stairs .
one disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast of beacon hill , with armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground .
dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured , and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest a scene in an unknown vault , where scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud .
all were pointing to a certain passage , and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes .
the title of the picture was , , lowell and longfellow lie buried in mount auburn . '
as i gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity , i began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing .
in the first place , i said to myself , these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity they showed in pickman .
the fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement .
in the second place , they terrified because of their very greatness .
their art was the art that convinced when we saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were afraid of them .
and the queer part was , that pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie .
nothing was blurred , distorted , or conventionalized ; outlines were sharp and lifelike , and details were almost painfully defined .
and the faces !
it was not any mere artist interpretation that we saw ; it was pandemonium itself , crystal clear in stark objectivity .
that was it , by heaven !
the man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all he did not even try to give us the churning , prismatic ephemera of dreams , but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable , mechanistic , and horror world which he saw fully , brilliantly , squarely , and unfalteringly .
god knows what that world can have been , or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through it ; but whatever the baffling source of his images , one thing was plain .
pickman was in every sense in conception and in execution a thorough , painstaking , and almost scientific realist .
my host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio , and i braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases .
as we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his to a corner of the large open space at hand , revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor .
we walked nearer , and i saw that it must be five feet across , with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground level solid work of the seventeenth century , or i was much mistaken .
that , pickman said , was the kind of thing he had been talking about an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill .
i noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up , and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover .
thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if pickman wild hints had not been mere rhetoric , i shivered slightly ; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size , provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio .
an acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work .
the unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs , and showed the painstaking methods of the artist .
scenes were blocked out with extreme care , and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions .
the man was great i say it even now , knowing as much as i do .
a large camera on a table excited my notice , and pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds , so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town for this or that view .
he thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work , and declared he employed them regularly .
there was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room , and when pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light i could not for my life keep back a loud scream the second i had emitted that night .
it echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar , and i had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter .
merciful creator !
eliot , but i do know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy .
it does seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that !
it was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes , and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man , gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy .
its position was a kind of crouch , and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its present prey and seek a juicier morsel .
but damn it all , it was even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain head of all panic not that , nor the dog face with its pointed ears , bloodshot eyes , flat nose , and drooling lips .
it was the scaly claws nor the body nor the of these , though any one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madness .
it was the technique , eliot the cursed , the impious , the unnatural technique !
as i am a living being , i never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a canvas .
the monster was there it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared and i knew that only a suspension of nature laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the fiend has ever had .
pinned with a to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up probably , i thought , a photograph from which pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance .
i reached out to uncurl and look at it , when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot .
he had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar , and now he seemed struck with a fright which , though not comparable to my own , had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual .
he drew a revolver and motioned me to silence , then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him .
i think i was paralysed for an instant .
imitating pickman listening , i fancied i heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere , and a series of squeals or beats in a direction i could determine .
i thought of huge rats and shuddered .
then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh a furtive , groping kind of clatter , though i ca attempt to convey what i mean in words .
it was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick wood on brick what did that make me think of ?
it came again , and louder .
there was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before .
after that followed a sharp grating noise , a shouted gibberish from pickman , and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver , fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect .
a muffled squeal or squawk , and a thud .
then more wood and brick grating , a pause , and the opening of the door at which i confess i started violently .
pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon , cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well .
deuce knows what they eat , thurber , ' he grinned , those archaic tunnels touched graveyard and and .
but whatever it is , they must have run short , for they were devilish anxious to get out .
your yelling stirred them up , i fancy .
better be cautious in these old places our rodent friends are the one drawback , though i sometimes think they a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colour . '
well , eliot , that was the end of the night adventure .
pickman had promised to show me the place , and heaven knows he had done it .
he led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction , it seems , for when we sighted a we were in a street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses .
charter street , it turned out to be , but i was too flustered to notice just where we hit it .
we were too late for the elevated , and walked back downtown through hanover street .
i remember that wall .
we switched from tremont up beacon , and pickman left me at the corner of joy , where i turned off .
i never spoke to him again .
why did i drop him ?
do be impatient .
wait till i ring for coffee .
we had enough of the other stuff , but i for one need something .
no it was the paintings i saw in that place ; though i swear they were enough to get him ostracised in of the homes and clubs of boston , and i guess you wo wonder now why i have to steer clear of subways and cellars .
it was something i found in my coat the next morning .
you know , the paper tacked to the frightful canvas in the cellar ; the thing i thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster .
that last scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it , and it seems i had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket .
but here the coffee take it black , eliot , if you wise .
yes , that paper was the reason i dropped pickman ; richard upton pickman , the greatest artist i have ever known and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness .
eliot old reid was right .
he was strictly human .
either he was born in strange shadow , or he found a way to unlock the forbidden gate .
it all the same now , for he gone back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt .
here , let have the chandelier going .
do ask me to explain or even conjecture about what i burned .
do ask me , either , what lay behind that scrambling pickman was so keen to pass off as rats .
there are secrets , you know , which might have come down from old salem times , and cotton mather tells even stranger things .
you know how damned lifelike pickman paintings were how we all wondered where he got those faces .
well that paper was a photograph of any background , after all .
what it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas .
it was the model he was using and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail .
but by god , eliot , it was a photograph from life !
attired simply , in a black evening dress , she appeared outwardly a typical product of modern civilization ; but tonight she felt the immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic surroundings .
was it because of the strange home in which she lived , that abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the inmates scarcely more than strangers ?
was it that , or was it some greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space , whereby she had been born too late , too early , or too far away from the haunts of her spirit ever to harmonize with the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality ?
to dispel the mood which was engulfing her more and more deeply each moment , she took a magazine from the table and searched for some healing bit of poetry .
poetry had always relieved her troubled mind better than anything else , though many things in the poetry she had seen detracted from the influence .
over parts of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of sterile ugliness and restraint , like dust on a through which one views a magnificent sunset .
listlessly turning the magazine pages , as if searching for an elusive treasure , she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor .
an observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had discovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her unattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before .
it was only a bit of vers libre , that pitiful compromise of the poet who overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers ; but it had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels , who gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty .
devoid of regularity , it yet had the harmony of winged , spontaneous words , a harmony missing from the formal , verse she had known .
as she read on , her surroundings gradually faded , and soon there lay about her only the mists of dream , the purple , mists beyond time , where only gods and dreamers walk .
amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars , of her delight at the coming of a new age of song , a rebirth of pan .
half closing her eyes , she repeated words whose melody lay hidden like crystals at the bottom of a stream before dawn , hidden but to gleam effulgently at the birth of day .
out of the mists gleamed godlike the torm ot a youth , in winged helmet and sandals , , and of a beauty like to nothing on earth .
before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which apollo had given him in trade for the shell of melody , and upon her brow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses .
then , adoring , hermes spoke nymph more fair than the sisters of cyene or the sky inhabiting atlantides , beloved of aphrodite and blessed of pallas , thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the gods , which lieth in beauty and song .
prophetess more lovely than the sybil of cumae when apollo first knew her , thou has truly spoken of the new age , for even now on maenalus , pan sighs and stretches in his sleep , wishful to wake and behold about him the little fauns and the antique satyrs .
in thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal , saving only a few whom the world rejects , remembereth that the gods were never dead , but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of gods in hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset .
and now draweth nigh the time of their awakening , when coldness and ugliness shall perish , and zeus sit once more on olympus .
already the sea about paphos trembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on before , and at night on helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings and notes .
woods and fields are tremulous at twilight with the shimmering of white saltant forms , and immemorial ocean yields up curious sights beneath thin moons .
the gods are patient , and have slept long , but neither man nor giant shall defy the gods forever .
in tartarus the titans writhe and beneath the fiery aetna groan the children of uranus and gaea .
the day now dawns when man must answer for centuries of denial , but in sleeping the gods have grown kind and will not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of gods .
instead will their vengeance smite the darkness , fallacy and ugliness which have turned the mind of man ; and under the sway of bearded saturnus shall mortals , once more sacrificing unto him , dwell in beauty and delight .
this night shalt thou know the favour of the gods , and behold on parnassus those dreams which the gods have through ages sent to earth to show that they are not dead .
for poets are the dreams of gods , and in each and every age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the promise from the lotosgardens beyond the sunset .
then in his arms hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies .
gentle breezes from the tower of aiolas wafted them high above warm , scented seas , till suddenly they came upon zeus , holding court upon parnassus , his golden throne flanked by apollo and the muses on the right hand , and by dionysus and pleasure flushed bacchae on the left hand .
so much of splendour marcia had never seen before , either awake or in dreams , but its radiance did her no injury , as would have the radiance of lofty olympus ; for in this lesser court the father of gods had tempered his glories for the sight of mortals .
before the mouth of the corycian cave sat in a row six noble forms with the aspect of mortals , but the countenances of gods .
these the dreamer recognized from images of them which she had beheld , and she knew that they were none else than the divine maeonides , the avernian dante , the more than mortal shakespeare , the milton , the cosmic goethe and the musalan keats .
these were those messengers whom the gods had sent to tell men that pan had passed not away , but only slept ; for it is in poetry that gods speak to men .
then spake the thunderer daughter for , being one of my endless line , thou art indeed my daughter behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers gods have sent down that in the words and writing of men there may be still some traces of divine beauty .
other bards have men justly crowned with enduring laurels , but these hath apollo crowned , and these have i set in places apart , as mortals who have spoken the language of the gods .
long have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the west , and spoken only through our dreams ; but the time approaches when our voices shall not be silent .
it is a time of awakening and change .
once more hath phaeton ridden low , searing the fields and drying the streams .
in gaul lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no more , and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals .
ares and his train have gone forth with the madness of gods and have returned deimos and phobos glutted with unnatural delight .
tellus moons with grief , and the faces of men are as the faces of erinyes , even as when astraea fled to the skies , and the waves of our bidding encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone .
amidst this chaos , prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival , even now toileth our latest born messenger , in whose dreams are all the images which other messengers have dreamed before him .
he it is that we have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the world hath known before , and to write words wherein shall echo all the wisdom and the loveliness of the past .
he it is who shall proclaim our return and sing of the days to come when fauns and dryads shall haunt their accustomed groves in beauty .
guided was our choice by those who now sit before the corycian grotto on thrones of ivory , and in whose songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shalt know the greater messenger when he cometh .
attend their voices as one by one they sing to thee here .
each note shall thou hear again in the poetry which is to come , the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy soul , though search for it through bleak years thou must .
attend with diligence , for each chord that vibrates away into hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to earth , as alpheus , sinking his waters into the soul of hellas , appears as the crystal arethusa in remote sicilia .
then arose homeros , the ancient among bards , who took his lyre and chanted his hymn to aphrodite .
no word of greek did marcia know , yet did the message not fall vainly upon her ears , for in the cryptic rhythm was that which spake to all mortals and gods , and needed no interpreter .
so too the songs of dante and goethe , whose unknown words dave the ether with melodies easy to ready and adore .
but at last remembered accents resounded before the listener .
it was the swan of avon , once a god among men , and still a god among gods accents still more familiar arose as milton , blind no more , declaimed immortal harmony last of all came the young voice of keats , closest of all the messengers to the beauteous as the singer ceased , there came a sound in the wind blowing from far egypt , where at night aurora mourns by the nile for her slain memnon .
to the feet of the thunderer flew the goddess and , kneeling , cried , master , it is time i unlocked the gates of the east .
and phoebus , handing his lyre to calliope , his bride among the muses , prepared to depart for the jewelled and palace of the sun , where fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of day .
so zeus descended from his cavern throne and placed his hand upon the head of marcia , saying daughter , the dawn is nigh , and it is well that thou shouldst return before the awakening of mortals to thy home .
weep not at the bleakness of thy life , for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the gods shall once more walk among men .
search thou unceasingly for our messenger , for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort .
by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness , and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find that which it craveth .
as zeus ceased , the young hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading stars , up and westward over unseen seas .
and as she speaks there comes again a vision of parnassus and the far off sound of a mighty voice saying , by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness , and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth .
high up , crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mount whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the old chateau of my ancestors .
for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about , serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honored line is older even than the castle walls .
these ancient turrets , stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time , formed in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all france .
from its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements barons , counts , and even kings had been defied , yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invader .
but since those glorious years , all is changed .
a poverty but little above the level of dire want , together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life , have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour ; and the falling stones of the walls , the overgrown vegetation in the parks , the dry and dusty moat , the courtyards , and toppling towers without , as well as the sagging floors , the wainscots , and the faded tapestries within , all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur .
as the ages passed , first one , then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin , until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate .
it was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that i , antoine , last of the unhappy and accursed counts de , first saw the light of day , ninety long years ago .
within these walls and amongst the dark and shadowy forests , the wild ravines and grottos of the hillside below , were spent the first years of my troubled life .
my parents i never knew .
my father had been killed at the age of thirty two , a month before i was born , by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle .
and my mother having died at my birth , my care and education devolved solely upon one remaining servitor , an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence , whose name i remember as pierre .
i was an only child and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian , in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill .
at that time , pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company .
now i know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearths .
thus isolated , and thrown upon my own resources , i spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the library of the chateau , and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dust of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot .
it was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy .
those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attention .
of my own race i was permitted to learn singularly little , yet what small knowledge of it i was able to gain seemed to depress me much .
perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which i ever felt at the mention of my great house , yet as i grew out of childhood , i was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse , let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility , that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which i had always deemed strange , but which now became dimly terrible .
the circumstance to which i allude is the early age at which all the counts of my line had met their end .
whilst i had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of men , i afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths , and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man , who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of years .
upon my birthday , the aged pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son , and continued by each possessor .
its contents were of the most startling nature , and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions .
at this time , my belief in the supernatural was firm and , else i should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes .
the paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century , when the old castle in which i sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress .
it told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelled on our estates , a person of no small accomplishments , though little above the rank of peasant , by name , michel , usually designated by the surname of mauvais , the evil , on account of his sinister reputation .
he had studied beyond the custom of his kind , seeking such things as the philosopher stone or the elixir of eternal life , and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy .
michel mauvais had one son , named charles , a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts , who had therefore been called le sorcier , or the wizard .
this pair , shunned by all honest folk , were suspected of the most hideous practices .
old michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the devil , and the unaccountable disappearance of many small peasant children was laid at the dreaded door of these two .
yet through the dark natures of the father and son ran one redeeming ray of humanity ; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity , whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection .
one night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young godfrey , son to henri , the count .
a searching party , headed by the frantic father , invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old michel mauvais , busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron .
without certain cause , in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair , the count laid hands on the aged wizard , and ere he released his murderous hold , his victim was no more .
meanwhile , joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice , telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain .
as the count and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemist , the form of charles le sorcier appeared through the trees .
the excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred , yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father fate .
then , slowly advancing to meet the count , he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of .
a noble of thy line survive to reach a greater age than thine ! '
spake he , when , suddenly leaping backwards into the black woods , he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his father slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night .
the count died without utterance , and was buried the next day , but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth .
no trace of the assassin could be found , though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighboring woods and the meadowland around the hill .
thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the minds of the late count family , so that when godfrey , innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title , was killed by an arrow whilst hunting at the age of , there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise .
but when , years afterward , the next young count , robert by name , was found dead in a nearby field of no apparent cause , the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his birthday when surprised by early death .
louis , son to robert , was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age , and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle henris , roberts , antoines , and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder .
that i had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which i had read .
my life , previously held at small value , now became dearer to me each day , as i delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic .
isolated as i was , modern science had produced no impression upon me , and i laboured as in the middle ages , as wrapt as had been old michel and young charles themselves in the acquisition of demonological and alchemical learning .
yet read as i might , in no manner could i account for the strange curse upon my line .
in unusually rational moments i would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation , attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister charles le sorcier and his heirs ; yet , having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist , i would fall back to occult studies , and once more endeavor to find a spell , that would release my house from its terrible burden .
upon one thing i was absolutely resolved .
i should never wed , for , since no other branch of my family was in existence , i might thus end the curse with myself .
as i drew near the age of thirty , old pierre was called to the land beyond .
alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life .
thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress , and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom , to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met .
much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau , which in youth fear had caused me to shun , and some of which old pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries .
strange and awesome were many of the objects i encountered .
furniture , covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness , met my eyes .
cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere , and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom .
of my exact age , even down to days and hours , i kept a most careful record , for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much of my doomed existence .
at length i approached that time which i had so long viewed with apprehension .
since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of count henri at his end , i was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death .
in what strange form the curse should overtake me , i knew not ; but i was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim .
with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents .
it was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle , less than a week before that fatal hour which i felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth , beyond which i could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that i came upon the culminating event of my whole life .
i had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets .
as the afternoon progressed , i sought the lower levels , descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement , or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder .
as i slowly traversed the passageway at the foot of the last staircase , the paving became very damp , and soon i saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank , wall impeded my journey .
turning to retrace my steps , my eye fell upon a small trapdoor with a ring , which lay directly beneath my foot .
pausing , i succeeded with difficulty in raising it , whereupon there was revealed a black aperture , exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter , and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps .
as soon as the torch which i lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and steadily , i commenced my descent .
the steps were many , and led to a narrow passage which i knew must be far underground .
this passage proved of great length , and terminated in a massive oaken door , dripping with the moisture of the place , and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it .
ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction , i had proceeded back some distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind .
without warning , i heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hinges .
my immediate sensations were incapable of analysis .
to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as i had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description .
when at last i turned and faced the seat of the sound , my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld .
there in the ancient gothic doorway stood a human figure .
it was that of a man clad in a and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour .
his long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue , and of incredible profusion .
his forehead , high beyond the usual dimensions ; his cheeks , and heavily lined with wrinkles ; and his hands , long , , and gnarled , were of such a deadly whiteness as i have never elsewhere seen in man .
his figure , lean to the proportions of a skeleton , was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment .
but strangest of all were his eyes , twin caves of abysmal blackness , profound in expression of understanding , yet inhuman in degree of wickedness .
these were now fixed upon me , piercing my soul with their hatred , and rooting me to the spot whereon i stood .
at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence .
the language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of latin in use amongst the more learned men of the middle ages , and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and demonologists .
the apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house , told me of my coming end , dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old michel mauvais , and gloated over the revenge of charles le sorcier .
he told how young charles has escaped into the night , returning in after years to kill godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his father at his assassination ; how he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself , unknown , in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator , how he had seized robert , son of godfrey , in a field , forced poison down his throat , and left him to die at the age of , thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse .
at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all , how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died , for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards , father and son , speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth .
his enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the black malevolence that had first so haunted me , but suddenly the fiendish glare returned and , with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent , the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had charles le sorcier , six hundred years before , ended that of my ancestor .
prompted by some preserving instinct of , i broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable , and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence .
i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance .
the shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves , and i fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint .
when at last my senses returned , all was frightfully dark , and my mind , remembering what had occurred , shrank from the idea of beholding any more ; yet curiosity all .
who , i asked myself , was this man of evil , and how came he within the castle walls ?
why should he seek to avenge the death of michel mauvais , and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of charles le sorcier ?
the dread of years was lifted from my shoulder , for i knew that he whom i had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse ; and now that i was free , i burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries , and made of my own youth one nightmare .
determined upon further exploration , i felt in my pockets for flint and steel , and lit the unused torch which i had with me .
first of all , new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger .
the hideous eyes were now closed .
disliking the sight , i turned away and entered the chamber beyond the gothic door .
here i found what seemed much like an alchemist laboratory .
in one corner was an immense pile of shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch .
it may have been gold , but i did not pause to examine it , for i was strangely affected by that which i had undergone .
at the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest .
filled with wonder , yet now realizing how the man had obtained access to the chateau , i proceeded to return .
i had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face but , as i approached the body , i seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound , as though life were not yet wholly extinct .
aghast , i turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor .
then all at once the horrible eyes , blacker even than the seared face in which they were set , opened wide with an expression which i was unable to interpret .
the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand .
once i caught the name of charles le sorcier , and again i fancied that the words ' and ' issued from the twisted mouth .
still i was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech .
at my evident ignorance of his meaning , the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me , until , helpless as i saw my opponent to be , i trembled as i watched him .
suddenly the wretch , animated with his last burst of strength , raised his piteous head from the damp and sunken pavement .
then , as i remained , paralyzed with fear , he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and nights .
! '
he shrieked , you not guess my secret ?
have you no brain whereby you may recognize the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon the house ?
have i not told you of the great elixir of eternal life ?
know you not how the secret of alchemy was solved ?
i tell you , it is i !
i !
i !
that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge , for i am charles le sorcier ! '
the horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty .
i was lost , completely , hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the mammoth cave .
turn as i might , in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path .
that nevermore should i behold the blessed light of day , or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world outside , my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief .
hope had departed .
yet , indoctrinated as i was by a life of philosophical study , i derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour ; for although i had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations , i experienced none of these , but stood quiet as soon as i clearly realised the loss of my bearings .
nor did the thought that i had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment .
if i must die , i reflected , then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford , a conception which carried with it more of tranquillity than of despair .
starving would prove my ultimate fate ; of this i was certain .
some , i knew , had gone mad under circumstances such as these , but i felt that this end would not be mine .
my disaster was the result of no fault save my own , since unknown to the guide i had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers ; and , wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave , had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which i had pursued since forsaking my companions .
already my torch had begun to expire ; soon i would be enveloped by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth .
as i stood in the waning , unsteady light , i idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my coming end .
i remembered the accounts which i had heard of the colony of consumptives , who , taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world , with its steady , uniform temperature , pure air , and peaceful quiet , had found , instead , death in strange and ghastly form .
i had seen the sad remains of their cottages as i passed them by with the party , and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and vigorous as i .
now , i grimly told myself , my opportunity for settling this point had arrived , provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life .
as the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity , i resolved to leave no stone unturned , no possible means of escape neglected ; so , summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs , i set up a series of loud shoutings , in the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamour .
yet , as i called , i believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose , and that my voice , magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me , fell upon no ears save my own .
all at once , however , my attention was fixed with a start as i fancied that i heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the cavern .
was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon ?
had , then , all my horrible apprehensions been for naught , and was the guide , having marked my unwarranted absence from the party , following my course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth ?
whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain , i was on the point of renewing my cries , in order that my discovery might come the sooner , when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as i listened ; for my ever acute ear , now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence of the cave , bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were not like those of any mortal man .
in the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region , the tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive blows .
these impacts were soft , and stealthy , as of the paws of some feline .
besides , when i listened carefully , i seemed to trace the falls of four instead of two feet .
i was now convinced that i had by my own cries aroused and attracted some wild beast , perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the cave .
perhaps , i considered , the almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that of hunger ; yet the instinct of , never wholly dormant , was stirred in my breast , and though escape from the peril might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end , i determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as i could command .
strange as it may seem , my mind conceived of no intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility .
accordingly , i became very quiet , in the hope that the unknown beast would , in the absence of a guiding sound , lose its direction as had i , and thus pass me by .
but this hope was not destined for realisation , for the strange footfalls steadily advanced , the animal evidently having obtained my scent , which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as is that of the cave , could doubtless be followed at great distance .
seeing therefore that i must be armed for defense against an uncanny and unseen attack in the dark , i groped about me the largest of the fragments of rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the vicinity , and grasping one in each hand for immediate use , awaited with resignation the inevitable result .
meanwhile the hideous pattering of the paws drew near .
certainly , the conduct of the creature was exceedingly strange .
most of the time , the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped , walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt hind and fore feet , yet at brief and infrequent intervals i fancied that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion .
i wondered what species of animal was to confront me ; it must , i thought , be some unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a life long confinement in its interminable recesses .
it doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish , bats and rats of the cave , as well as some of the ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of green river , which communicates in some occult manner with the waters of the cave .
i occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alteration cave life might have wrought in the physical structure of the beast , remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cave .
then i remembered with a start that , even should i succeed in felling my antagonist , i should never behold its form , as my torch had long since been extinct , and i was entirely unprovided with matches .
the tension on my brain now became frightful .
my disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me , and that actually seemed to press upon my body .
nearer , nearer , the dreadful footfalls approached .
it seemed that i must give vent to a piercing scream , yet had i been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing , my voice could scarce have responded .
i was petrified , rooted to the spot .
i doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive .
now the steady pat , pat , of the steps was close at hand ; now very close .
i could hear the laboured breathing of the animal , and as i was , i realised that it must have come from a considerable distance , and was correspondingly fatigued .
suddenly the spell broke .
my right hand , guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing , threw with full force the bit of limestone which it contained , toward that point in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering , and , wonderful to relate , it nearly reached its goal , for i heard the thing jump , landing at a distance away , where it seemed to pause .
having readjusted my aim , i discharged my second missile , this time most effectively , for with a flood of joy i listened as the creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving .
almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me , i reeled back against the wall .
the breathing continued , in heavy , gasping inhalations and expirations , whence i realised that i had no more than wounded the creature .
and now all desire to examine the thing ceased .
at last something allied to groundless , superstitious fear had entered my brain , and i did not approach the body , nor did i continue to cast stones at it in order to complete the extinction of its life .
instead , i ran at full speed in what was , as nearly as i could estimate in my frenzied condition , the direction from which i had come .
suddenly i heard a sound or rather , a regular succession of sounds .
in another instant they had resolved themselves into a series of sharp , metallic clicks .
this time there was no doubt .
it was the guide .
and then i shouted , yelled , screamed , even shrieked with joy as i beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering effulgence which i knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch .
i ran to meet the flare , and before i could completely understand what had occurred , was lying upon the ground at the feet of the guide , embracing his boots and gibbering , despite my boasted reserve , in a most meaningless and idiotic manner , pouring out my terrible story , and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with protestations of gratitude .
at length , i awoke to something like my normal consciousness .
the guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party at the entrance of the cave , and had , from his own intuitive sense of direction , proceeded to make a thorough canvass of just ahead of where he had last spoken to me , locating my whereabouts after a quest of about four hours .
by the time he had related this to me , i , emboldened by his torch and his company , began to reflect upon the strange beast which i had wounded but a short distance back in the darkness , and suggested that we ascertain , by the flashlight aid , what manner of creature was my victim .
accordingly i retraced my steps , this time with a courage born of companionship , to the scene of my terrible experience .
soon we descried a white object upon the floor , an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself .
cautiously advancing , we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment , for of all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld , this was in surpassing degree the strangest .
it appeared to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions , escaped , perhaps , from some itinerant menagerie .
its hair was , a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the cave , but it was also surprisingly thin , being indeed largely absent save on the head , where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in considerable profusion .
the face was turned away from us , as the creature lay almost directly upon it .
the inclination of the limbs was very singular , explaining , however , the alternation in their use which i had before noted , whereby the beast used sometimes all four , and on other occasions but two for its progress .
from the tips of the fingers or toes , long claws extended .
the hands or feet were not prehensile , a fact that i ascribed to that long residence in the cave which , as i before mentioned , seemed evident from the and almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy .
no tail seemed to be present .
the respiration had now grown very feeble , and the guide had drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature , when a sudden sound emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused .
the sound was of a nature difficult to describe .
it was not like the normal note of any known species of simian , and i wonder if this unnatural quality were not the result of a long continued and complete silence , broken by the sensations produced by the advent of the light , a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first entrance into the cave .
the sound , which i might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of chattering , was faintly continued .
all at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of the beast .
the paws went through a convulsive motion , and the limbs contracted .
with a jerk , the white body rolled over so that its face was turned in our direction .
for a moment i was so struck with horror at the eyes thus revealed that i noted nothing else .
they were black , those eyes , deep jetty black , in hideous contrast to the snow white hair and flesh .
like those of other cave denizens , they were deeply sunken in their orbits , and were entirely destitute of iris .
as i looked more closely , i saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the average ape , and infinitely less hairy .
the nose was quite distinct .
as we gazed upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision , the thick lips opened , and several sounds issued from them , after which the thing relaxed in death .
the guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that the light shook fitfully , casting weird moving shadows on the walls .
i made no motion , but stood rigidly still , my horrified eyes fixed upon the floor ahead .
the fear left , and wonder , awe , compassion , and reverence succeeded in its place , for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth .
the creature i had killed , the strange beast of the unfathomed cave , was , or had at one time been a ! ! !
my memories are very confused .
there is even much doubt as to where they begin ; for at times i feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me , while at other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey , formless infinity .
i am not even certain how i am communicating this message .
while i know i am speaking , i have a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what i say to the points where i wish to be heard .
my identity , too , is bewilderingly cloudy .
i seem to have suffered a great shock perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique , incredible experience .
these cycles of experience , of course , all stem from that book .
i remember when i found it in a dimly lighted place near the black , oily river where the mists always swirl .
that place was very old , and the shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves .
there were , besides , great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins ; and it was in one of these heaps that i found the thing .
i never learned its title , for the early pages were missing ; but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling .
there was a formula a sort of list of things to say and do which i recognized as something black and forbidden ; something which i had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe guarded secrets whose decaying texts i loved to absorb .
it was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young , and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know .
not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it , but this book was very old indeed .
no , but the hand of some half crazed monk , had traced these ominous latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity .
i remember how the old man leered and tittered , and made a curious sign with his hand when i bore it away .
he had refused to take pay for it , and only long afterwards did i guess why .
as i hurried home through those narrow , winding , waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet .
the centuried , tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity as if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened .
i felt that those walls and gables of mildewed brick and fungoid plaster and timber with eyelike , windows that leered could hardly desist from advancing and crushing me yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away .
i remember how i read the book at last , and locked in the attic room that i had long devoted to strange searchings .
the great house was very still , for i had not gone up till after midnight .
i think i had a family then though the details are very uncertain and i know there were many servants .
just what the year was i can not say ; for since then i have known many ages and dimensions , and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned .
it was by the light of candles that i read i recall the relentless dripping of the wax and there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries .
i seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness , as if i feared to hear some very remote , intruding note among them .
then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city .
it came as i droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay , and i knew amidst my shudders what it meant .
for he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow , and never again can he be alone .
i had evoked and the book was indeed all i had suspected .
that night i passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision , and when morning found me in the attic room i saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which i had never seen before .
nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it .
mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future , and every object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight .
from then on i walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and shapes ; and with each new gateway crossed , the less plainly could i recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which i had so long been bound .
what i saw about me , none else saw ; and i grew doubly silent and aloof lest i be thought mad .
dogs had a fear of me , for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side .
but still i read more in hidden , forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and toward the core of the unknown cosmos .
i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor , and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought .
the walls melted away , and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me .
after a while there was utter blackness , and then the light of myriad stars forming strange , alien constellations .
finally i saw a plain far below me , and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion i had ever known or read or dreamed of .
as i floated closer to that city i saw a great square building of stone in an open space , and felt a hideous fear clutching at me .
i screamed and struggled , and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor .
in that night wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former night wandering ; but there was more of terror because i knew i was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than i had ever been before .
thereafter i was more cautious with my incantations , for i had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence i could never return
it is said that in ulthar , which lies beyond the river skai , no man may kill a cat ; and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire .
for the cat is cryptic , and close to strange things which men can not see .
he is the soul of antique aegyptus , and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in meroe and ophir .
he is the kin of the jungle lords , and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa .
the sphinx is his cousin , and he speaks her language ; but he is more ancient than the sphinx , and remembers that which she hath forgotten .
in ulthar , before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats , there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors .
why they did this i know not ; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night , and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight .
but whatever the reason , this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel ; and from some of the sounds heard after dark , many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar .
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife ; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two , and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard .
in truth , much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk , they feared them more ; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins , merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees .
when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed , and sounds heard after dark , the loser would lament impotently ; or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished .
for the people of ulthar were simple , and knew not whence it is all cats first came .
one day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar .
dark wanderers they were , and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year .
in the they told fortunes for silver , and bought gay beads from the merchants .
what was the land of these wanderers none could tell ; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers , and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats , hawks , rams and lions .
and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwixt the horns .
there was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother , but only a tiny black kitten to cherish .
the plague had not been kind to him , yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow ; and when one is very young , one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten .
so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon .
on the third morning of the wanderers ' stay in ulthar , menes could not find his kitten ; and as he sobbed aloud in the certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife , and of sounds heard in the night .
and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation , and finally to prayer .
he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand ; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand , since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming .
it was very peculiar , but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy , nebulous figures of exotic things ; of hybrid creatures crowned with disks .
nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative .
that night the wanderers left ulthar , and were never seen again .
and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found .
from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished ; cats large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white .
old kranon , the burgomaster , swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes ' kitten ; and cursed the caravan and the little boy .
but nith , the lean notary , declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect ; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold .
still , no one durst complain to the sinister couple ; even when little atal , the innkeeper son , vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees , pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage , two abreast , as if in performance of some rite of beasts .
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy ; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death , they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .
so ulthar went to sleep in vain anger ; and when the people awakened at dawn behold !
every cat was back at his accustomed hearth !
large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white , none was missing .
very sleek and fat did the cats appear , and sonorous with purring content .
the citizens talked with one another of the affair , and marveled not a little .
old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them , since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife .
but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious .
and for two whole days the sleek , lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food , but only doze by the fire or in the sun .
it was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees .
then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away .
in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty , though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses .
and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor , and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners .
there was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar .
zath , the coroner , disputed at length with nith , the lean notary ; and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions .
even little atal , the innkeeper son , was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward .
they talked of the old cotter and his wife , of the caravan of dark wanderers , of small menes and his black kitten , of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer , of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left , and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard .
and in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travelers in nir ; namely , that in ulthar no man may kill a cat .
of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written .
the ecstasies and horrors of de quincey and the paradis artificiels of baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them immortal , and the world knows well the beauty , the terror and the mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is transported .
but much as has been told , no man has yet dared intimate the nature of the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind , or hint at the direction of the roads along whose ornate and exotic course the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne .
de quincey was drawn back into asia , that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous antiquity is so impressive that the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual , but farther than that he dared not go .
those who have gone farther seldom returned , and even when they have , they have been either silent or quite mad .
i took opium but once in the year of the plague , when doctors sought to deaden the agonies they could not cure .
there was an overdose my physician was worn out with horror and exertion and i travelled very far indeed .
in the end i returned and lived , but my nights are filled with strange memories , nor have i ever permitted a doctor to give me opium again .
the pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the drug was administered , of the future i had no heed ; to escape , whether by cure , unconsciousness , or death , was all that concerned me .
i was partly delirious , so that it is hard to place the exact moment of transition , but i think the effect must have begun shortly before the pounding ceased to be painful .
as i have said , there was an overdose ; so my reactions were probably far from normal .
the sensation of falling , curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction , was paramount ; though there was subsidiary impression of unseen throngs in incalculable profusion , throngs of infinitely diverse nature , but all more or less related to me .
sometimes it seemed less as though i were falling , than as though the universe or the ages were falling past me .
suddenly my pain ceased , and i began to associate the pounding with an external rather than internal force .
the falling had ceased also , giving place to a sensation of uneasy , temporary rest ; and when i listened closely , i fancied the pounding was that of the vast , inscrutable sea as its sinister , colossal breakers lacerated some desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude .
then i opened my eyes .
for a moment my surroundings seemed confused , like a projected image hopelessly out of focus , but gradually i realised my solitary presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows .
of the exact nature of the apartment i could form no idea , for my thoughts were still far from settled , but i noticed rugs and draperies , elaborately fashioned tables , chairs , ottomans , and divans , and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the exotic without being actually alien .
these things i noticed , yet they were not long uppermost in my mind .
slowly but inexorably crawling upon my consciousness and rising above every other impression , came a dizzying fear of the unknown ; a fear all the greater because i could not analyse it , and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menace ; not death , but some nameless , unheard of thing inexpressibly more ghastly and abhorrent .
presently i realised that the direct symbol and excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain .
it seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which i stood , and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images .
i felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the walls , and shrank from glancing through the arched , latticed windows that opened so bewilderingly on every hand .
perceiving shutters attached to these windows , i closed them all , averting my eyes from the exterior as i did so .
then , employing a flint and steel which i found on one of the small tables , i lit the many candles reposing about the walls in arabesque sconces .
the added sense of security brought by closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree , but i could not shut out the monotonous pounding .
now that i was calmer , the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful , and i felt a contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful shrinking .
opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the pounding , i beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a cavern door and large oriel window .
to this window i was irresistibly drawn , though my apprehensions seemed almost equally bent on holding me back .
as i approached it i could see a chaotic whirl of waters in the distance .
then , as i attained it and glanced out on all sides , the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with full and devastating force .
i beheld such a sight as i had never beheld before , and which no living person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of opium .
the building stood on a narrow point of land or what was now a narrow point of land fully three hundred feet above what must lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters .
on either side of the house there fell a newly precipice of red earth , whilst ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully , eating away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation .
out a mile or more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in height , and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures .
the waves were dark and purplish , almost black , and clutched at the yielding red mud of the bank as if with uncouth , greedy hands .
i could not but feel that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon all the solid ground , perhaps abetted by the angry sky .
recovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural spectacle had thrown me , i realized that my actual physical danger was acute .
even whilst i gazed , the bank had lost many feet , and it could not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit of lashing waves .
accordingly i hastened to the opposite side of the edifice , and finding a door , emerged at once , locking it after me with a curious key which had hung inside .
i now beheld more of the strange region about me , and marked a singular division which seemed to exist in the hostile ocean and firmament .
on each side of the jutting promontory different conditions held sway .
at my left as i faced inland was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in under a brightly shining sun .
something about that sun nature and position made me shudder , but i could not then tell , and can not tell now , what it was .
at my right also was the sea , but it was blue , calm , and only gently undulating , while the sky above it was darker and the bank more nearly white than reddish .
i now turned my attention to the land , and found occasion for fresh surprise ; for the vegetation resembled nothing i had ever seen or read about .
it was apparently tropical or at least a conclusion borne out by the intense heat of the air .
sometimes i thought i could trace strange analogies with the flora of my native land , fancying that the plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical change of climate ; but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were plainly foreign .
the house i had just left was very small hardly more than a cottage but its material was evidently marble , and its architecture was weird and composite , involving a quaint fusion of western and eastern forms .
at the corners were corinthian columns , but the red tile roof was like that of a chinese pagoda .
from the door inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand , about four feet wide , and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable flowering shrubs and plants .
it lay toward the side of the promontory where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish .
down this path i felt impelled to flee , as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the pounding ocean .
at first it was slightly uphill , then i reached a gentle crest .
behind me i saw the scene i had left ; the entire point with the cottage and the black water , with the green sea on one side and the blue sea on the other , and a curse unnamed and unnamable lowering over all .
i never saw it again , and often wonder after this last look i strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before me .
the path , as i have intimated , ran along the shore as one went inland .
ahead and to the left i now viewed a magnificent valley comprising thousands of acres , and covered with a swaying growth of tropical grass higher than my head .
almost at the limit of vision was a colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me .
by this time wonder and escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely dissipated my fear , but as i paused and sank fatigued to the path , idly digging with my hands into the warm , sand , a new and acute sense of danger seized me .
some terror in the swishing tall grass seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea , and i started up crying aloud and disjointedly , tiger ?
tiger ?
is it tiger ?
beast ?
beast ?
is it a beast that i am afraid of ?
my mind wandered back to an ancient and classical story of tigers which i had read ; i strove to recall the author , but had difficulty .
then in the midst of my fear i remembered that the tale was by rudyard kipling ; nor did the grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me ; i wished for the volume containing this story , and had almost started back toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the lure of the palm prevented me .
whether or not i could have resisted the backward beckoning without the of the vast palm tree , i do not know .
this attraction was now dominant , and i left the path and crawled on hands and knees down the valley slope despite my fear of the grass and of the serpents it might contain .
i resolved to fight for life and reason as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land , though i sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant breakers .
i would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for relief , but could never quite shut out the detestable sound .
it was , as it seemed to me , only after ages that i finally dragged myself to the beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shade .
there now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror ; incidents which i tremble to recall and dare not seek to interpret .
no sooner had i crawled beneath the overhanging foliage of the palm , than there dropped from its branches a young child of such beauty as i never beheld before .
though ragged and dusty , this being bore the features of a faun or demigod , and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the tree .
it smiled and extended its hand , but before i could arise and speak i heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing ; notes high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness .
the sun had by this time sunk below the horizon , and in the twilight i saw an aureole of lambent light encircled the child head .
then in a tone of silver it addressed me it is the end .
they have come down through the gloaming from the stars .
now all is over , and beyond the arinurian streams we shall dwell blissfully in
as the child spoke , i beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree , and rising , greeted a pair whom i knew to be the chief singers among those i had heard .
a god and goddess they must have been , for such beauty is not mortal ; and they took my hands , saying , come , child , you have heard the voices , and all is well .
in teloe beyond the milky way and the arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony .
and upon their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful stars .
under the ivory bridges of teloe flow rivers of liquid gold bearing bound for blossomy cytharion of the seven suns .
and in teloe and cytharion abide only youth , beauty , and pleasure , nor are any sounds heard , save of laughter , song , and the lute .
only the gods dwell in teloe of the golden rivers , but among them shalt thou dwell .
as i listened , enchanted , i suddenly became aware of a change in my surroundings .
the palm tree , so lately overshadowing my exhausted form , was now some distance to my left and considerably below me .
i was obviously floating in the atmosphere ; companioned not only by the strange child and the radiant pair , but by a constantly increasing throng of , youths and maidens with hair and joyful countenance .
we slowly ascended together , as if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from the golden nebulae , and the child whispered in my ear that i must look always upward to the pathways of light , and never backward to the sphere i had just left .
the youths and maidens now chanted mellifluous choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes , and i felt enveloped in a peace and happiness more profound than any i had in life imagined , when the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my soul .
through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists , as if in mocking , daemoniac concord , throbbed from gulfs below the damnable , the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean .
as those black breakers beat their message into my ears i forgot the words of the child and looked back , down upon the doomed scene from which i thought i had escaped .
down through the aether i saw the accursed earth slowly turning , ever turning , with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted cities .
and under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights i can never describe , sights i can never forget ; deserts of corpselike clay and jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains and villages of my native land , and maelstroms of frothing ocean where once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers .
around the northern pole steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours , hissing before the onslaught of the waves that curled and fretted from the shuddering deep .
then a rending report clave the night , and athwart the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift .
still the black ocean foamed and gnawed , eating away the desert on either side as the rift in the center widened and widened .
there was now no land left but the desert , and still the fuming ocean ate and ate .
all at once i thought even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something , afraid of dark gods of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters , but even if it was it could not turn back ; and the desert had suffered too much from those nightmare waves to help them now .
so the ocean ate the last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf , thereby giving up all it had ever conquered .
from the lands it flowed again , uncovering death and decay ; and from its ancient and immemorial bed it trickled loathsomely , uncovering nighted secrets of the years when time was young and the gods unborn .
above the waves rose weedy remembered spires .
the moon laid pale lilies of light on dead london , and paris stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with .
then rose spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered ; terrible spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were lands .
there was not any pounding now , but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of waters tumbling into the rift .
the smoke of that rift had changed to steam , and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser .
it seared my face and hands , and when i looked to see how it affected my companions i found they had all disappeared .
then very suddenly it ended , and i knew no more till i awaked upon a bed of convalescence .
as the cloud of steam from the plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire surface from my sight , all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether .
in one delirious flash and burst it happened ; one blinding , deafening holocaust of fire , smoke , and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to the void .
and when the smoke cleared away , and i sought to look upon the earth , i beheld against the background of cold , humorous stars only the dying sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister .
writing on what my doctor tells me is my deathbed , my most hideous fear is that the man is wrong .
i suppose i shall seem to be buried next week , but
in london there is a man who screams when the church bells ring .
he lives all alone with his streaked cat in gray inn , and people call him harmlessly mad .
his room is filled with books of the tamest and most puerile kind , and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble pages .
all he seeks from life is not to think .
for some reason thought is very horrible to him , and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague .
he is very thin and grey and wrinkled , but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks .
fear has its grisly claws upon him , and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and forehead .
friends and companions he shuns , for he wishes to answer no questions .
those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now .
he dropped them all years ago , and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway .
it is a decade now since he moved into gray inn , and of where he had been he would say nothing till the night young williams bought the necronomicon .
williams was a dreamer , and only , and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room .
he forced his friendship where old friends dared not force theirs , and marvelled at the fright that sat upon this gaunt , haggard watcher and listener .
for that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt .
he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears , and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay , insipid novels .
and when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and scream , and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last peal died reverberantly away .
but try as williams would , he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or hidden .
the old man would not live up to his aspect and manner , but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles ; his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto .
that his learning was deep and thorough , his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear ; and williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to harrow and oxford .
later it developed that he was none other than lord northam , of whose ancient hereditary castle on the yorkshire coast so many odd things were told ; but when williams tried to talk of the castle , and of its reputed roman origin , he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it .
he even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed , hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the north sea , was brought up .
so matters went till that night when williams brought home the infamous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred .
he had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year , when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in chandos street ; and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it .
the old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful .
but now , at last , he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure .
it was at a jew shop in the squalid precincts of clare market , where he had often bought strange things before , and he almost fancied the gnarled old levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made .
the bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible , and the price was so absurdly slight .
the one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports , and some of the diagrams set in the vague latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain .
he felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it , and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old jew chuckled disturbingly behind him .
but when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist , and reluctantly called on his strange , frightened friend for help with the twisted , mediaeval latin .
lord northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat , and started violently when the young man entered .
then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly , and fainted altogether when williams uttered the title .
it was when he regained his senses that he told his story ; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers , lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashes .
there must , lord northam whispered , have been something wrong at the start ; but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far .
he was the nineteenth baron of a line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the past unbelievably far , if vague tradition could be heeded , for there were family tales of a descent from times , when a certain lunaeus gabinius capito , military tribune in the third augustan legion then stationed at lindum in roman britain , had been summarily expelled from his command for participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion .
gabinius had , the rumour ran , come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the elder sign in the dark ; strange folk whom the britons knew not save in fear , and who were the last to survive from a great land in the west that had sunk , leaving only the islands with the roths and circles and shrines of which stonehenge was the greatest .
there was no certainty , of course , in the legend that gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a line which pict and saxon , dane and norman were powerless to obliterate ; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the black prince whom edward third created baron of northam .
these things were not certain , yet they were often told ; and in truth the stonework of northam keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of hadrian wall .
as a child lord northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle , and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience .
he became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying ; a searcher for strange realms and relationships once familiar , yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth .
filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and ominous , and that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the known at every point , northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult mystery .
nowhere , however , could he find ease and content ; and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him .
during the he dabbled in satanism , and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of nature .
books like ignatius donnelly commercial account of atlantis he absorbed with zest , and a dozen obscure precursors of charles fort enthralled him with their vagaries .
he would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder , and once went into the desert of araby to seek a nameless city of faint report , which no man has ever beheld .
there rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed , which if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back of his memory .
it might be in the visible world , yet it might be only in his mind and soul .
perhaps he held within his own brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions ; which would bind him to the stars , and to the infinities and eternities beyond them .
written on december , .
published june in the scot there is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream , and out of which no stream flows .
ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath , but sarnath stands there no more .
it is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young , before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar , another city stood beside the lake ; the gray stone city of ib , which was old as the lake itself , and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold .
very odd and ugly were these beings , as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned .
it is written on the brick cylinders of kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it ; that they had bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears , and were without voice .
it is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist ; they and the vast still lake and gray stone city ib .
however this may be , it is certain that they worshipped a stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great ; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous .
and it is written in the papyrus of ilarnek , that they one day discovered fire , and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions .
but not much is written of these beings , because they lived in very ancient times , and man is young , and knows but little of the very ancient living things .
after many eons men came to the land of mnar , dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks , who built thraa , ilarnek , and kadatheron on the winding river ai .
and certain tribes , more hardy than the rest , pushed on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth .
not far from the gray city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath , and at the beings of ib they marveled greatly .
but with their marveling was mixed hate , for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk .
nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of ib , for why those sculptures lingered so late in the world , even until the coming men , none can tell ; unless it was because the land of mnar is very still , and remote from most other lands , both of waking and of dream .
as the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew , and it was not less because they found the beings weak , and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and arrows .
so one day the young warriors , the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen , marched against ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof , pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears , because they did not wish to touch them .
and because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of ib they cast these also into the lake ; wondering from the greatness of the labor how ever the stones were brought from afar , as they must have been , since there is naught like them in the land of mnar or in the lands adjacent .
thus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared , save the sea green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the .
this the young warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of th , and as a sign of leadership in mnar .
but on the night after it was set up in the temple , a terrible thing must have happened , for weird lights were seen over the lake , and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the lying dead , as from some fear unspeakable .
and before he died , had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of .
after there were many in sarnath but never was the stone idol found .
and many centuries came and went , wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly , so that only priests and old women remembered what had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite .
betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan route , and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river ai and beyond .
so sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful , and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighboring cities ; and in time there sate upon a throne in sarnath the kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacent .
the wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the magnificent .
of polished marble were its walls , in height three hundred cubits and in breadth , so that chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top .
for full five hundred stadia did they run , being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib .
in sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans , and fifty more intersecting them .
with onyx were they paved , save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod , which were paved with granite .
and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets , each of bronze , and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men .
the houses of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony , each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet .
with strange art were they builded , for no other city had houses like them ; and travelers from thraa and ilarnek and kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted .
but more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples , and the gardens made by zokkar the olden king .
there were many palaces , the last of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron .
so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky ; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dother their walls showed vast paintings of kings and armies , of a splendor at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder .
many were the pillars of the palaces , all of tinted marble , and carven into designs of surpassing beauty .
and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials , so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers .
and there were likewise fountains , which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art .
outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of the lands adjacent .
on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne , many steps above the gleaming floor .
and it was wrought of one piece of ivory , though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come .
in that palace there were also many galleries , and many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings .
sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts , and then were enacted stirring , or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things .
lofty and amazing were the seventeen temples of sarnath , fashioned of a bright stone not known elsewhere .
a full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them , wherein the high priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings .
on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces ; where gathered throngs in worship of and tamash and lobon , the chief gods of sarnath , whose shrines were as the thrones of monarchs .
not like the eikons of other gods were those of and tamash and lobon .
for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones .
and up unending steps of zircon was the , wherefrom the looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day ; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets , and their reflections in the lake , at night .
here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug , the water lizard , and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the doom scrawl of .
wonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king .
in the center of sarnath they lay , covering a great space and encircled by a high wall .
and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass , through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear , and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear .
in summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans , and in winter they were heated with concealed fires , so that in those gardens it was always spring .
there ran little streams over bright pebbles , dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues , and spanned by a multitude of bridges .
many were the waterfalls in their courses , and many were the hued lakelets into which they expanded .
over the streams and lakelets rode white swans , whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters .
in ordered terraces rose the green banks , adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms , and seats and benches of marble and porphyry .
and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods .
each year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying of ib , at which time wine , song , dancing , and merriment of every kind abounded .
great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings , and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of zokkar .
and the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it .
at first the liked not these festivals , for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the eikon had vanished , and how had died from fear and left a warning .
and they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake .
but as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters .
indeed , had they not themselves , in their high tower , often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug , the ?
and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath , wonder of the world .
gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of ib .
for a decade had it been talked of in the land of mnar , and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from thraa , ilarnek , and kadetheron , and all the cities of mnar and the lands beyond .
before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travelers .
within his reclined , the king , drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnoth , and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves .
there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast ; peacocks from the distant hills of linplan , heels of camels from the bnazic desert , nuts and spices from sydathrian groves , and pearls from mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa .
of sauces there were an untold number , prepared by the subtlest cooks in all mnar , and suited to the palate of every feaster .
but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake , each of vast size , and served upon golden platters set with rubies and diamonds .
whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace , and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters , others feasted elsewhere .
in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels , and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands made merry .
and it was the who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake , and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath .
thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water , and saw that the gray rock akurion , which was wont to rear high above it near the shore , was almost submerged .
and fear grew vaguely yet swiftly , so that the princes of ilarnek and of far rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed , though they scarce knew the reason for their departing .
then , close to the hour of midnight , all the bronze gates of sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain , so that all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in fright .
for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable , and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof .
men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king , where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of and his nobles and slaves , but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears ; things which danced horribly , bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds and containing uncouth flames .
and the princes and travelers , as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and camels and elephants , looked again upon the lake and saw the gray rock akurion was quite submerged .
through all the land of mnar and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath , and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more .
it was long ere any travelers went thither , and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes , who are no kin to the men of mnar .
these men indeed went to the lake to view sarnath ; but though they found the vast still lake itself , and the gray rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore , they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind .
where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher , now stretched only the marshy shore , and where once had dwelt fifty million of men now crawled the detestable .
not even the mines of precious metal remained .
had come to sarnath .
but half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol ; an exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great .
that idol , enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek , was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of mnar .
three times randolph carter dreamed of the marvelous city , and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it .
all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset , with walls , temples , colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble , silver basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens , and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows ; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles .
it was a fever of the gods , a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals .
mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain ; and as carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost vanished memory , the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an awesome and momentous place .
he knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme ; though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it , or whether in dream or in waking , he could not tell .
vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth , when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days , and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager sound of lutes and song , unclosing fiery gates toward further and surprising marvels .
but each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dream tyrannous gods ; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot , or descend the wide marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning .
when for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed , he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath , in the cold waste where no man treads .
but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting , nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream , and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of nasht and , whose with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world .
it seemed , however , that his prayers must have been adversely heard , for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city ; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights , and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods .
at length , sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs , nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind , carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before , and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown kadath , veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars , holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the great ones .
in light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and .
and the priests shook their heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul .
they pointed out that the great ones had shown already their wish , and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas .
they reminded him , too , that not only had no man ever been to kadath , but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie ; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world , or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or aldebaran .
if in our dreamland , it might conceivably be reached , but only three human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands , and of that three , two had come back quite mad .
there were , in such voyages , incalculable local dangers ; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe , where no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity the boundless daemon sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud , and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled , maddening beating of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes ; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods , the blind , voiceless , tenebrous , mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
of these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and in the cavern of flame , but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown kadath in the cold waste , wherever that might be , and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city .
he knew that his journey would be strange and long , and that the great ones would be against it ; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him .
so asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course , he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted wood .
in the tunnels of that twisted wood , whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi , dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs ; who know many obscure secrets of the dream world and a few of the waking world , since the wood at two places touches the lands of men , though it would be disastrous to say where .
certain unexplained rumours , events , and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access , and it is well that they can not travel far outside the world of dreams .
but over the nearer parts of the dream world they pass freely , flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love .
most of them live in burrows , but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees ; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat , either physical or spiritual , for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out .
carter , however , had no fear ; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them ; having found through their help the splendid city of celephais in beyond the tanarian hills , where reigns half the year the great king kuranes , a man he had known by another name in life .
kuranes was the one soul who had been to the and returned free from madness .
threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks , carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs , and listened now and then for responses .
he remembered one particular village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood , where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a cleaning tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten , and toward this spot he hastened .
he traced his way by the grotesque fungi , which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed .
finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight .
this was the nearest of the great ring of stones , and carter knew he was close to the zoog village .
renewing his fluttering sound , he waited patiently ; and was at last rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him .
it was the zoogs , for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small , slippery brown outlines .
out they swarmed , from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree , till the whole region was alive with them .
some of the wilder ones brushed carter unpleasantly , and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear ; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders .
the council of sages , recognizing the visitor , offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others , which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon ; and as carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began .
the zoogs did not , unfortunately , know where the peak of kadath lies , nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another .
rumours of the great ones came equally from all points ; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys , since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath .
then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing by the others ; and said that in ulthar , beyond the river skai , there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame olathoe and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar .
those manuscripts he said , told much of the gods , and besides , in ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods , and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight .
he had failed , though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly .
so randolph carter thanked the zoogs , who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of wine to take with him , and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side , where the rushing skai flows down from the slopes of lerion , and hatheg and nir and ulthar dot the plain .
behind him , furtive and unseen , crept several of the curious zoogs ; for they wished to learn what might befall him , and bear back the legend to their people .
the vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village , and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat , standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers .
there he would turn sharply aside , for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor ; and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide .
remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks , and what it was possibly set up for , the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring ; for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead , and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberately .
carter detoured at the proper place , and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs .
he had known they would follow him , so he was not disturbed ; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures .
it was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood , and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning .
over fertile plains rolling down to the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys , and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land .
once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water , and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind .
at another house , where people were stirring , he asked questions about the gods , and whether they danced often upon lerion ; but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and tell him the way to nir and ulthar .
at noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir , which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction ; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the skai , into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it years before .
once on the other side , the frequent presence of cats ( who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs ) revealed the near neighborhood of ulthar ; for in ulthar , according to an ancient and significant law , no man may kill a cat .
very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar , with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms ; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself , with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough .
carter , the cats being somewhat dispersed by the zoogs , picked his way directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and old records were said to be ; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stone which crowns ulthar highest hill he sought out the patriarch atal , who had been up the forbidden peak in the stony desert and had come down again alive .
atal , seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple , was fully three centuries old ; but still very keen of mind and memory .
from him carter learned many things about the gods , but mainly that they are indeed only earth gods , ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere .
they might , atal said , heed a man prayer if in good humour ; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste .
it was lucky that no man knew where kadath towers , for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave .
atal companion banni the wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of .
with unknown kadath , if ever found , matters would be much worse ; for although earth gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal , they are protected by the other gods from outside , whom it is better not to discuss .
at least twice in the world history the other gods set their seal upon earth primal granite ; once in antediluvian times , as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic manuscripts too ancient to be read , and once on when barzai the wise tried to see earth gods dancing by moonlight .
so , atal said , it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers .
carter , though disappointed by atal discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven cryptical books of hsan , did not wholly despair .
first he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace , thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods ' aid ; but atal could tell him nothing .
probably , atal said , the place belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general land of vision that many know ; and conceivably it might be on another planet .
in that case earth gods could not guide him if they would .
but this was not likely , since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the great ones wished to hide from him .
then carter did a wicked thing , offering his guileless host so many draughts of the which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative .
robbed of his reserve , poor atal babbled freely of forbidden things ; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek , on the isle of oriab in the southern sea , and hinting that it may be a likeness which earth gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain .
and he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange , so that one might easily recognize them , and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods .
now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to carter .
it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones often espouse the daughters of men , so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their blood .
this being so , the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on ngranek and mark the features ; then , having noted them with care , to search for such features among living men .
where they are plainest and thickest , there must the gods dwell nearest ; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands kadath .
much of the great ones might be learnt in such regions , and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker .
they might not know their parentage , for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly ; a thing which carter realized even as he sought to scale kadath .
but they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows , and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the dreamland that common folk would call them fools ; and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath , or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret .
and more , one might in certain cases seize some child of a god as hostage ; or even capture some young god himself , disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his bride .
atal , however , did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab ; and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges down to the southern sea ; where no burgess of ulthar has ever been , but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and carts .
there is a great city there , , but in ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore .
the traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human , or nearly so , but the rowers are never beheld ; and it is not thought wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers can not be exhibited .
by the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy , and carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest .
as he turned to go , he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him , and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit .
then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto , and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard , in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest conversation .
he recalled , too , the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside .
and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens , he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked their chops , and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no farther .
it was sunset now , so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town .
and as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond , all mellow and magical in the slanted light , he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always , were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one onward toward unknown perils .
then twilight fell , and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic , and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows .
and sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above , and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the skai .
with the night came song , and carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of simple ulthar .
and there might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthar many cats , but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting .
some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moon dark side , whither the cats leap from tall housetops , but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in carter lap to purr and play , and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant , drowsy herbs .
in the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for dylath leen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthar busy farms .
and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the skai ; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns , and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmen songs came from the placid river .
the country was very beautiful , with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills .
on the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead , and then the tall black towers of , which is built mostly of basalt .
with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the giant causeway , and its streets are dark and uninviting .
there are many dismal near the myriad wharves , and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth .
carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab , and found that they knew of it well .
ships came from baharna on that island , one being due to return thither in only a month , and ngranek is but two days ' from that port .
but few had seen the stone face of the god , because it is on a very difficult side of ngranek , which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava .
once the gods were angered with men on that side , and spoke of the matter to the other gods .
it was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in sea taverns , because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys .
one of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore , and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock .
the mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide , and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste .
and their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the six kingdoms .
but worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers .
those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable , and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded , yet to give no glimpse of its crew .
it was not fair to the of , or to the grocers and butchers , either ; for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard .
the merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from parg across the river .
that was all they ever took , those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers ; never anything from the butchers and grocers , but only gold and the fat black men of parg whom they bought by the pound .
and the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described .
only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old bear them .
dylath leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere , but no mine in all barth dreamland was known to produce their like .
of these things cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna , which might bear him to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren .
meanwhile he did not fall to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset .
of these things , however , he learned nothing ; though he once thought that a certain old merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of .
this man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of leng , which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar .
he was even rumoured to have dealt with that not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery .
that such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted , but carter soon found that it was no use questioning him .
then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and the tall lighthouse , silent and alien , and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town .
uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront , and after a while the dark wide mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers .
carter observed them closely , and disliked them more the longer he looked at them .
then he saw them drive the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley , and wondered in what lands or if in any lands at all those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve .
and on the third evening of that galley stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him , smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of carter quest .
he appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling ; and although the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful , carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked .
he bade him therefore be his guest in locked chambers above , and drew out the last of the zoogs ' to loosen his tongue .
the strange merchant drank heavily , but smirked unchanged by the draught .
then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own , and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby , grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended .
he offered his wine to his host , and though carter took only the least sip , he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles .
all the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly , and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth .
carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent like awning on the deck of a ship , with the marvellous coasts of the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness .
he was not chained , but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby , and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches .
he saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a of earth a in ancient kingsport had often discoursed in the old days , and recognized the templed terraces of zak , abode of forgotten dreams ; the spires of infamous thalarion , that of a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns ; the charnel gardens of zura , land of pleasures unattained , and the twin headlands of crystal , meeting above in a resplendent arch , which guard the harbour of , blessed land of fancy .
past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely , urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below .
and before the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the basalt pillars of the west , beyond which simple folk say splendid cathuria lies , but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods , blind , voiceless , tenebrous , and mindless , with their soul and messenger nyarlathotep .
meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent , though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest .
it is understood in the land of dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men ; and all these agents , whether wholly human or slightly less than human , are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans , hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their castle of kadath , had decided to take him away and deliver him to nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize .
what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside , carter could not guess ; nor could he imagine at what hellish they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward .
he knew , however , that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central void .
at the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates .
then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around .
but when they gave carter a portion , he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it ; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him .
and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath , and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derived .
it was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead .
and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars , and the deck grew damp , and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink .
then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken , and carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and into planetary space .
never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether , leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass , and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity .
these are the nameless larvae of the other gods , and like them are blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts .
but that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared , for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon .
the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it , and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably .
the ship made for the edge , and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from earth , and which no fully human person , save perhaps the dreamer , has ever beheld .
the close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter , and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there .
the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods , and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution .
and what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been , carter steadily refused to conjecture .
when the ship rounded the edge , and sailed over those lands unseen by man , there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life , and carter saw many low , broad , round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi .
he noticed that these cottages had no windows , and thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux .
then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea , and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water or at least through some liquid .
the galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound , and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to carter .
they now slid along at great speed , once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form , but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and even though the sun shone scorchingly in it .
there presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a coast , and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city .
the way they leaned and bent , the manner in which they were clustered , and the fact that they had no windows at all , was very disturbing to the prisoner ; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban .
as the coast drew nearer , and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger , he saw upon the jagged hills many forests , some of whose trees he recognized as akin to that solitary in the enchanted wood of earth , from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their curious wine .
carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead , and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them .
for they were not men at all , or even approximately men , but great slippery things which could expand and contract at will , and whose principal shape though it often changed was that of a sort of toad without any eyes , but with a curious vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt , vague snout .
these objects were waddling busily about the wharves , moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength , and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws .
and now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves , which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in ; only these herds , being without turbans or shoes or clothing , did not seem so very human after all .
some of the slaves the fatter ones , whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans .
once a van was hitched and driven off , and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that carter gasped , even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place .
now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley , followed by a great crew of the slippery as officers , navigators , and rowers .
and carter saw that the almost human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength , such as steering and cooking , fetching and carrying , and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded .
these creatures must have been convenient on earth , for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned , and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations .
but most of them , unless lean or , were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things .
occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated ; some very like these , some not so similar , and some not similar at all .
and he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays .
when the galley landed at a quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of wiggled out of the hatches , and two of them seized carter and dragged him ashore .
the smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling , and carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows .
at length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness .
it was , apparently , all one to the whether it were light or dark .
the odour of the place was intolerable , and when carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions .
it was circular , and about twenty feet across .
from then on time ceased to exist .
at intervals food was pushed in , but carter would not touch it .
what his fate would be , he did not know ; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity other gods , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
finally , after an unguessed span of hours or days , the great stone door swung wide again , and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the streets of that fearsome city .
it was night on the moon , and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches .
in a detestable square a sort of procession was formed ; ten of the and almost human , eleven on either side , and one each before and behind .
carter was placed in the middle of the line ; five ahead and five behind , and one on either side of him .
certain of the produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds .
to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi , soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city .
that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited , carter could not doubt ; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over .
the whining of those impious flutes was shocking , and he would have given worlds for some even sound ; but these had no voices , and the slaves did not talk .
then through that darkness there did come a normal sound .
it rolled from the higher hills , and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus .
it was the midnight yell of the cat , and carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats , and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally , springing from high housetops .
verily , it is to the moon dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows , and here amidst that column of foetid things carter heard their homely , friendly cry , and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home .
now much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter , and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable .
but that he need not have done , for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer , and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions .
the call of the clan had been given , and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it .
the flutes stopped , and there were shrieks in the night .
dying screamed , and cats spit and yowled and roared , but the made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi .
it was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted , and carter had never before seen so many cats .
black , grey , and white ; yellow , tiger , and mixed ; common , persian , and marix ; thibetan , angora , and egyptian ; all were there in the fury of battle , and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of bubastis .
they would leap seven strong at the throat of an or the pink tentacled snout of a and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain , where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine .
carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave , but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders .
then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors , and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray .
at last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes , and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene .
the great shining disc of the earth , thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it , had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape ; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array .
circle on circle they reached , and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly .
of the dead slaves and there were not many signs , but carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the warriors .
carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats , and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate .
he had not been unmarked in ulthar when he passed through , and the sleek old cats had remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten .
and they recalled , too , how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn , and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left .
the grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled , for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dream .
a yowl now came from the farther peak , and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation .
it was one of the army outposts , stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earth cats fear ; the very large and peculiar cats from saturn , who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon dark side .
they are leagued by treaty with the evil , and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats ; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter .
after a brief consultation of generals , the cats rose and assumed a closer formation , crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland .
the old advised carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers , and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed .
he also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired , and carter decided on the city of whence the black galley had set out ; for he wished to sail thence for oriab and the carven crest ngranek , and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys , if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off .
then , upon a signal , the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst ; while in a black cave on an unhallowed summit of the still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
the leap of the cats through space was very swift ; and being surrounded by his companions carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss .
before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at , and the stealthy , friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams .
the old leader from ulthar was the last to leave , and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow .
when dawn came , carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving .
there was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab , and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways .
most of the townsfolk believed him ; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the merchants .
if aught of evil ever befalls through such traffick , it will not be his fault .
in about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall lighthouse , and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men , with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes .
her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriab inner groves , and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna , and the strange little figures carved from ngranek ancient lava .
for this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in parg .
carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days .
and during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek , and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon ; but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava gatherers and in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it .
the captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face , for the wrong side of ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister , and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the .
but the captain did not wish to say just what a might be like , since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them .
then carter asked that captain about unknown kadath in the cold waste , and the marvellous sunset city , but of these the good man could truly tell nothing .
carter sailed out of one early morning when the tide turned , and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town .
and for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts , and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying .
but on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of water was stronger , and soon passed from sight of any land .
on the fifth day the sailors were nervous , but the captain apologized for their fears , saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory , and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it .
he admitted , moreover , that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea ; having been hailed when quite close to it , but never seen again .
that night the moon was very bright , and one could see a great way down in the water .
there was so little wind that the ship could not move much , and the ocean was very calm .
looking over the rail carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of the great temple , and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square .
dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins , and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there , sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea .
as the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills , and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the walls of myriad little houses .
then the suburbs appeared , and finally a great lone building on a hill , of simpler architecture than the other structures , and in much better repair .
it was dark and low and covered four sides of a square , with a tower at each corner , a paved court in the centre , and small curious round windows all over it .
probably it was of basalt , though weeds draped the greater part ; and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or a monastery .
some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining , and carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears .
then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court , and saw that something was tied to it .
and when after getting a telescope from the captain cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of oriab , head downward and without any eyes , he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea .
the next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for zar , in the land of forgotten dreams , with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo .
and on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of oriab with ngranek rising jagged and in the distance .
oriab is a very great isle , and its port of baharna a mighty city .
the wharves of baharna are of porphyry , and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them , having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings .
there is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of yath , on whose farther shore are the vast ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered .
as the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons thon and thal gleamed a welcome , and in all the million windows of baharna terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk , till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour .
the captain , after landing , made carter a guest in his own small house on the shores of yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it ; and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the traveller delight .
and in the days after that carter asked for rumours and legends of ngranek in all the taverns and public places where and meet , but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face .
ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it , and besides , one could never depend on the certainty that are altogether fabulous .
when the captain sailed hack to carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town , which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of yath farther shore .
here he laid his plans for the ascent of ngranek , and correlated all that he had learned from the about the roads thither .
the keeper of the tavern was a very old man , and had heard so many legends that he was a great help .
he even took carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the old days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit ngranek higher slopes .
the old had heard from his great grandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed ngranek and seen the carven face , here drawing it for others to behold , but carter had very great doubts , since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless , and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste , with horns and wings and claws and curling tails .
at last , having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of baharna , carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by yath shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony ngranek .
on his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses , and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the skai .
by evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on yath farther shore , and though old had warned him not to camp there at night , he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher .
around him he wrapped another blanket , for the nights are cold in oriab ; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin groves .
the sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of yath , and carter looked about for his tethered zebra .
great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied , and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead , with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat .
his pack had been disturbed , and several shiny knickknacks taken away , and all round on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account .
the legends and warnings of occurred to him , and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night .
then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward ngranek , though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple , with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peer .
his course now lay uphill through wilder and partly wooded country , and he saw only the huts of and the camp of those who gathered resin from the groves .
the whole air was fragrant with balsam , and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun .
near sunset he came on a new camp of lava gatherers returning with laden sacks from ngranek lower slopes ; and here he also camped , listening to the songs and tales of the men , and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost .
he had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him , and at nightfall did not return to his fellows .
when they looked for him the next day they found only his turban , nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen .
they did not search any more , because the old man among them said it would be of no use .
no one ever found what the took , though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous .
carter asked them if sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints , but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry .
when he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more , but went to sleep in his blanket .
the next day he rose with the and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he bought of them .
their older men gave him blessings and warnings , and told him he had better not climb too high on ngranek , but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded .
for still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown kadath ; and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset .
by noon , after a long uphill ride , he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the who had once dwelt thus close to ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava .
here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavernkeeper grandfather , but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked .
their homes had crept even up the mountain slope , and the higher they built the more people they would miss when the sun rose .
at last they decided it would be better to leave altogether , since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably ; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in baharna , inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of which to this day they carry on .
it was from these children of the exiled that carter had heard the best tales about ngranek when searching through baharna ancient taverns .
all this time the great gaunt side of ngranek was looming up higher and higher as carter approached it .
there were sparse trees on the lower slopes and feeble shrubs above them , and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky , to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow .
carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone , and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it .
in places there were solid streams of lava , and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges .
ninety aeons ago , before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak , that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders .
now it towered all silent and sinister , bearing on the hidden side that secret titan image whereof rumour told .
and there were caves in that mountain , which might be empty and alone with elder darkness , or might if legend spoke truly hold horrors of a form not to be surmised .
the ground sloped upward to the foot of ngranek , thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees , and strewn with bits of rock , lava , and ancient cinder .
there were the charred embers of many camps , where the were wont to stop , and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the great ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in ngranek high passes and labyrinthine caves .
at evening carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night , tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blankets before going to sleep .
and all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool , but carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror , since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slope of ngranek .
in the clear sunshine of morning carter began the long ascent , taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go , but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin wood became too steep .
thereafter he scrambled up alone ; first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings , and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there .
he regretted coming clear of the trees , since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying .
at length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked about ; the deserted huts of the , the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them , the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing , and even a hint very far away of the shores of yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten .
he found it best not to look around , and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling to .
then the soil became meagre , with great patches of bare rock cropping out , and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice .
finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock , and had it not been very rough and weathered , he could scarcely have ascended farther .
knobs , ledges , and pinnacles , however , helped greatly ; and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some scratched clumsily in the friable stone , and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him .
after a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by handholds and footholds hewn where they were needed , and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found .
in one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent .
once or twice carter dared to look around , and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below .
all the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight , with baharna stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance .
and beyond that the illimitable southern sea with all its curious secrets .
thus far there had been much winding around the mountain , so that the farther and carven side was still hidden .
carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished , and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous .
after ten minutes he saw it was indeed no , but that it led steeply on in an arc which would , unless suddenly interrupted or deflected , bring him after a few hours ' climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava .
as new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed .
the mountain side , too , was somewhat different ; being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left .
some of these were above him and some beneath him , all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man .
the air was very cold now , but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it .
only the increasing rarity bothered him , and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths .
he was not much impressed by travellers ' tales , but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble .
all lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown kadath .
at last , in the fearsome iciness of upper space , he came round fully to the hidden side of ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked olden wrath of the great ones .
there was unfolded , too , a vast expanse of country to the south ; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys , and seemed to have no ending .
no trace of the sea was visible on this side , for oriab is a great island .
black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs , but none of them was accessible to a climber .
there now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view , and carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable .
poised in windy insecurity miles above earth , with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other , he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun ngranek hidden side .
he could not turn round , yet the sun was already low .
if there were no way aloft , the night would find him crouching there still , and the dawn would not find him at all .
but there was a way , and he saw it in due season .
only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible footholds , yet to carter they were sufficient .
surmounting now the rock , he found the slope above much easier than that below , since a great glacier melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges .
to the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths , with a cave dark mouth just out of reach above him .
elsewhere , however , the mountain slanted back strongly , and even gave him space to lean and rest .
he felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line , and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight .
surely enough , there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above , and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed ; hanging there forever in bold outline .
and when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud , and clutched at the jagged rock in awe ; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earth dawn had shaped it , but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god .
stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire .
how vast it was no mind can ever measure , but carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it .
it was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods , and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker .
rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken , and carter saw that it was indeed so ; for those long narrow eyes and ears , and that thin nose and pointed chin , all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods .
he clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie , even though it was this which he had expected and come to find ; for there is in a god face more of marvel than prediction can tell , and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking downward at sunset in the scyptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old , the marvel is so strong that none may escape it .
here , too , was the added marvel of recognition ; for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the god children , he now knew that he need not do so .
certainly , the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort , but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport celephais which lies in beyond the tanarian hills and is ruled over by that king kuranes whom carter once knew in waking life .
every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais , and it was clear that these could be no others than the he sought .
where they dwelt , there must the cold waste lie close , and within it unknown kadath and its onyx castle for the great ones .
so to celephais he must go , far distant from the isle of oriab , and in such parts as would take him back to and up the skai to the bridge by nir , and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs , whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by oukranos to the gilded spires of thran , where he might find a galleon bound over the cerenarian sea .
but dusk was now thick , and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow .
perched on that ledge night found the seeker ; and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up , but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came , praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley .
the stars came out , but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes ; nothingness leagued with death , against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink .
the last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him , and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach .
suddenly , without a warning sound in the dark , carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand .
then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below .
and between him and the milky way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and .
other things , too , had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him , as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice .
then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet , and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space .
another minute and the stars were gone , and carter knew that the had got him .
they bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond .
when he struggled , as at first he did by instinct , they tickled him with deliberation .
they made no sound at all themselves , and even their membranous wings were silent .
they were frightfully cold and damp and slippery , and their paws kneaded one detestably .
soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling , giddying , sickening rush of dank , air ; and carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness .
he screamed again and again , but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety .
then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about , and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell , and which is litten only by the pale death fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earth core .
at last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled peaks of throk .
awful and sinister they stand in the haunted disc of sunless and eternal depths ; higher than man may reckon , and guarding terrible valleys where the dholes crawl and burrow nastily .
but carter preferred to look at them than at his captors , which were indeed shocking and uncouth black things with smooth , oily , surfaces , unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other , bat wings whose beating made no sound , ugly prehensile paws , and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly .
and worst of all , they never spoke or laughed , and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with , but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be .
all they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle ; that was the way of .
as the band flew lower the peaks of throk rose grey and towering on all sides , and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impressive granite of the endless twilight .
at still lower levels the in the air gave out , and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out .
soon the peaks were very far away , and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them .
then in the end the landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones , and left carter all alone in that black valley .
to bring him thither was the duty of the that guard ngranek ; and this done , they flapped away silently .
when carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not , since even the peaks of throk had faded out of sight .
there was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bones .
now carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of pnoth , where crawl and burrow the enormous dholes ; but he did not know what to expect , because no one has ever seen a dhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like .
dholes are known only by dim rumour , from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one .
they can not be seen because they creep only in the dark .
carter did not wish to meet a dhole , so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him .
even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective , for whispers of pnoth were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days .
in brief , it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings ; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than throk peaks which marks the edge of their domain .
showers of bones would tell him where to look , and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder ; for strange to say , he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures .
a man he had known in boston a painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyard had actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering .
this man had vanished at last , and carter was not sure but that he might find him now , and use for the first time in dreamland that english of his dim waking life .
in any case , he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of pnoth ; and it would be better to meet a ghoul , which one can see , than a dhole , which one can not see .
so carter walked in the dark , and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot .
once he bumped into a stony slope , and knew it must be the base of one of throk peaks .
then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air , and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls .
he was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below , but realised that the inner world has strange laws .
as he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull , and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul .
sound travels slowly , so it was some time before he heard an answering glibber .
but it came at last , and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered .
the wait for this was very tense , since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting .
indeed , it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off .
as this thoughtfully approached , he became more and more uncomfortable ; for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come .
finally the tension grew almost unbearable , and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound .
it was the ladder , and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands .
but the other sound did not cease , and followed him even as he climbed .
he had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic , and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below .
at a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling ; and hereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed dhole whose form no man might see .
for hours he climbed with aching and blistered hands , seeing again the grey and throk uncomfortable pinnacles .
at last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls , whose vertical side he could not glimpse ; and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of notre dame .
this almost made him lose his hold through faintness , but a moment later he was himself again ; for his vanished friend richard pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul , and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies .
so he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag , and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously .
he was now on a plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows .
the ghouls were in general respectful , even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively .
through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend , and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world .
a greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to pickman present habitation , so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould .
they emerged on a dim plain strewn with singular relics of earth old gravestones , broken urns , and grotesque fragments of monuments and carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the gate of deeper slumber .
there , on a tombstone of stolen from the granary burying ground in boston , sat a ghoul which was once the artist richard upton pickman .
it was naked and rubbery , and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure .
but it still remembered a little english , and was able to converse with carter in grunts and monosyllables , helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls .
when it learned that carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city celephais in beyond the tanarian hills , it seemed rather doubtful ; for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland ( leaving that to the wamps that are spawned in dead cities ) , and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood , including the terrible kingdom of the gugs .
the gugs , hairy and gigantic , once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the other gods and the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earth gods and they were banished to caverns below .
only a great trap door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the with the enchanted wood , and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse .
that a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable ; for mortal dreamers were their former food , and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts , those repulsive beings which die in the light , and which live in the vaults of zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroos .
so the ghoul that was pickman advised carter either to leave the abyss at sarkomand , that deserted city in the valley below leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diarote lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs , or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood .
this , however , did not suit the seeker ; for he knew nothing of the way from leng to , and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream .
it was disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in celephais , and who , being the sons of gods , must point the way to the cold waste and kadath where the great ones dwell .
after much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs ' kingdom .
there was one chance that carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors , and reach the central tower with the sign of koth upon it , which has the stairs leading up to that stone trap door in the enchanted wood .
pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door ; for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid , and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see them feasting there .
he also advised carter to disguise as a ghoul himself ; shaving the beard he had allowed to grow ( for ghouls have none ) , wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface , and loping in the usual slumping way , with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb .
they would reach the city of gugs which is coterminous with the whole kingdom through the proper burrows , emerging in a cemetery not far from the tower of koth .
they must beware , however , of a large cave near the cemetery ; for this is the mouth of the vaults of zin , and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them .
the ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs , for they can not discriminate .
they are very primitive , and eat one another .
the gugs have a sentry at a narrow in the vaults of zin , but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts .
though ghasts can not live in real light , they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours .
so at length carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of nepemiah derby , obit , from the charter street burying ground in salem .
when they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs .
on the right of the hole out of which they wriggled , and seen through aisles of monoliths , was a stupendous vista of cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth .
this was the great city of the gugs , whose doorways are thirty feet high .
ghouls come here often , for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year , and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men .
carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of pnoth .
straight ahead , and just outside the cemetery , rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned .
this the ghouls told carter to avoid as much as possible , since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness .
and truly , that warning was soon well justified ; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs ' resting had been rightly timed , there glowed in the gloom of that great cavern mouth first one pair of eyes and then another , implying that the gugs were one sentry less , and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell .
so the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent .
it was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices , and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw , since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults .
after a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight , and carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast , whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose , a forehead , and other important particulars .
presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow , and a ghoul glibbered softly at carter that their absence of was a bad sign .
it proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all , but had merely slipped past him as he slept , so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim .
it was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen , grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose , but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts .
and yet , horrible as they were , they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness .
it was a paw , fully two feet and a half across , and equipped with formidable talons .
after it came another paw , and after that a great arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms .
then two pink eyes shone , and the head of the awakened gug sentry , large as a barrel , wabbled into view .
the eyes jutted two inches from each side , shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs .
but the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth .
that mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head , opening vertically instead of horizontally .
but before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet , the vindictive ghasts were upon him .
carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin , till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression .
the battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one .
from all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug , nipping and tearing with their muzzles , and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves .
all the time they coughed excitedly , screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number , so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern .
as it was , the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness , with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance .
then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance , and carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight .
silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement , hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs .
apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour , the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace ; but even so the journey was no brief one , for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale .
at last , however , they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest ; above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in which made one shudder without knowing its meaning .
this was the central tower with the sign of koth , and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood .
there now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps , which were fashioned for gugs , and were therefore nearly a yard high .
of their number carter could form no just estimate , for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him .
all through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit ; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the great one curse , there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps , and escaped ghasts are often chased , even to the very top .
so sharp are the ears of gugs , that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke ; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants , accustomed from their in the vaults of zin to seeing without light , to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those cyclopean steps .
it was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all , but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers .
nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs .
there was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts , which frequently hopped up onto the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs .
if the gugs slept long , and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern , the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and things ; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug .
then , after aeons of climbing , there came a cough from the darkness above ; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn .
it was clear that a ghast , or perhaps even more , had strayed into that tower before the coming of carter and his guides ; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close .
after a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed carter to the wall and arranged his kinfolk in the best possible way , with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight .
ghouls can see in the dark , so the party was not as badly off as carter would have been alone .
in another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast , and the ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow .
presently two eyes flashed into view , and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering .
as it hopped down to the step above the ghouls , they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force , so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap .
there seemed to be only this one animal , and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped carter as a signal to proceed again .
as before , they were obliged to aid him ; and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghast uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blackness .
at last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt ; and feeling above him , carter realised that the great stone trap door was reached at last .
to open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of , but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop , and permit carter to escape through the crack .
they themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs , since their elusiveness was great , and they did not know the way overland to spectral sarkomand with its gate to the abyss .
mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them , and carter helped push with as much strength as he had .
they judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one , and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles .
after a few moments a crack of light appeared ; and carter , to whom that task had been entrusted , slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture .
there now ensued a mighty heaving ; but progress was very slow , and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open .
suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousand fold by a sound on the steps below them .
it was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghast hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels ; but of all the possible causes of that body dislodgement and rolling , none was in the least reassuring .
therefore , knowing the ways of gugs , the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy ; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst carter turned the slab and left a generous opening .
they now helped carter through , letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside .
another second and they were through themselves , knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap door while a panting became audible beneath .
because of the great one curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal , so with a deep relief and sense of repose carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest .
weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago , it was verily a haven and a delight after those gulfs he had now left behind .
there was no living denizen about , for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course .
to return through the tower they no longer dared , and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests nasht and in the cavern of flame .
so at length they decided to return through sarkomand and its gate of the abyss , though of how to get there they knew nothing .
carter recalled that it lies in the valley below leng , and recalled likewise that he had seen in a sinister , old merchant reputed to trade on leng , therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out , crossing the fields to nir and the skai and following the river to its mouth .
this they at once resolved to do , and lost no time in loping off , since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel .
and carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts , thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was pickman ; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left .
for a ghoul is a ghoul , and at best an unpleasant companion for man .
after that carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth , thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carried .
it was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees , but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day ; wherefore carter set out upon the route toward celephais , in beyond the tanarian hills .
and as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an on ngranek in oriab so many aeons ago , and wondered if any had fed and released it .
and he wondered , too , if he would ever return to baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by yath shore , and if the old tavernkeeper would remember him .
such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland .
but presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree .
he had avoided the great circle of stones , since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now ; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere .
upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion ; and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern .
for a war on the cats was under debate in that sovereign assembly of zoogs .
it all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after carter to ulthar , and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions .
the matter had long rankled ; and now , or at least within a month , the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks , taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares , and giving not even the myriad cats of ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise .
this was the plan of the zoogs , and carter saw that he must foil it before leaving upon his mighty quest .
very quietly therefore did randolph carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields .
and a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small , black , grey , tiger , white , yellow , and mixed , and it echoed through nir and beyond the skai even into ulthar , and ulthar numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march .
it was fortunate that the moon was not up , so that all the cats were on earth .
swiftly and silently leaping , they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood .
carter was there to greet them , and the sight of shapely , wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss .
he was glad to see his venerable friend and rescuer at the head of ulthar detachment , a collar of rank around his sleek neck , and whiskers bristling at a martial angle .
better still , as a in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that morning in ulthar .
he was a strapping and promising cat now , and purred as he shook hands with his friend .
his grandfather said he was doing very well in the army , and that he might well expect a captaincy after one more campaign .
carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe , and was rewarded by purrs of gratitude from all sides .
consulting with the generals , he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs ; forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilization of their army of invasion .
thereupon without a moment loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle .
flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs .
they saw that they were beaten in advance , and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present .
half the cats now seated themselves in a circular formation with the captured zoogs in the centre , leaving open a lane down which were marched the additional captives rounded up by the other cats in other parts of the wood .
terms were discussed at length , carter acting as interpreter , and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large tribute of grouse , quail , and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of the forest .
twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the temple of cats at ulthar , and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs .
these matters disposed of , the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes , which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance .
the old cat general now offered carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach , deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise .
this offer he welcomed with gratitude ; not only for the safety it afforded , but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats .
so in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment , relaxed after the successful performance of its duty , randolph carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees , talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of that primeval floor .
and the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown kadath in the cold waste , but did not know where it was .
as for the marvellous sunset city , he had not even heard of that , but would gladly relay to carter anything he might later learn .
he gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland , and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in celephais , whither he was bound .
that old cat , already slightly known to carter , was a dignified maltese ; and would prove highly influential in any transaction .
it was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood , and carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell .
the young he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it , but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army .
so carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a river , and the cats went back into the wood .
well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood of the cerenerian sea , and blithely did he follow the singing river oukianos that marked his course .
the sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn , and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dangle .
a blessed haze lies upon all this region , wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold , and a little more of the summer humming music of birds and bees ; so that men walk through it as through a faery place , and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember .
by noon carter reached the jasper terraces of kiran which slope down to the river edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the king of comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of oukianos , who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks .
all of jasper is that temple , and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts , its seven pinnacled towers , and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night .
many times the moon hears strange music as it shines on those courts and terraces and pinnacles , but whether that music be the song of the god or the chant of the cryptical priests , none but the king of ilek vad may say ; for only he had entered the temple or seen the priests .
now , in the drowsiness of day , that carven and delicate fane was silent , and carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under the enchanted sun .
all that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl .
sometimes he walked close to the bank of oukianos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream , and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side , whose trees came down clear to the water edge .
in former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink , but now he could not glimpse any .
once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird , which it lured to the water by showing its tempting scales in the sun , and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it .
toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of thran .
lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city , sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows , for they are more ancient than memory .
yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets , the clustered towers within , all white beneath their golden spires , are loftier still ; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky , sometimes shining clear , sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist , and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours .
and where thran gates open on the river are great wharves of marble , with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor , and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places .
landward beyond the walls lies the farm country , where small white cottages dream between little hills , and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens .
down through this verdant land carter walked at evening , and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of thran .
and just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate , and was stopped by a sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief , and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up thran steep mysterious streets and linger in the bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold .
then into that incredible city he walked ; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel , and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers .
lights shone through grated and balconied windows , and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled .
carter knew his way , and edged down through darker streets to the river , where at an old sea tavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams .
there he bought his passage to celephais on a great green galleon , and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn , who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods .
in the morning carter boarded the galleon bound for celephais , and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the cerenerian sea begun .
for many leagues the banks were much as they were above thran , with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right , and a drowsy village on the shore , with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun .
mindful of his search , carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of celephais , asking the names and ways of the strange men with long , narrow eyes , ears , thin noses , and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of celephais .
of these men the sailors knew not much , save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about them .
their land , very far away , was called inquanok , and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land , and said to be close to unpleasant leng ; although high impassable mountains towered on the side where leng was thought to lie , so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there , or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon .
certainly , men reached leng from very different oceans .
of other boundaries of inquanok those sailors had no notion , nor had they heard of the cold waste and unknown kadath save from vague unplaced report .
and of the marvellous sunset city which carter sought they knew nothing at all .
so the traveller asked no more of far things , but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight inquanok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on ngranek .
late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of kied .
here carter wished he might disembark , for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory , lone and unbroken , where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten .
spells of the elder ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed , for it is written that there may one day be need of them again ; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight , though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due .
but the ship swept on , and dusk hushed the hum of the day , and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind , leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been .
and all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected .
once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east , but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much , since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them .
in the morning the river had broadened out greatly , and carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of hlanith on the cerenerian sea .
here the walls are of rugged granite , and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables .
the men of hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland ; so that the city is not sought except for barter , but is prized for the solid work of its artisans .
the wharves of hlanith are of oak , and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns .
carter also went ashore , and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars .
the sea taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salted with the spray of high tides , and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low ceilings and casements of greenish panes .
ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports , and told many stories of the curious men from twilight inquanok , but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told .
then at last , after much unloading and loading , the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea , and the high walls and gables of hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them .
two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the cerenerian sea , sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel .
then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of aran with its swaying on the lower slope , and carter knew that they were come to the land of and the marvellous city of celephais .
swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town , and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues , and the great stone bridge where naraxa joins the sea .
then rose the gentle hills behind the town , with their groves and gardens of asphodels and the small shrines and cottages upon them ; and far in the background the purple ridge of the tanarians , potent and mystical , behind which lay forbidden ways into the waking world and toward other regions of dream .
the harbour was full of painted galleys , some of which were from the marble of serannian , that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky , and some of which were from more substantial parts of dreamland .
among these the steersman threaded his way up to the wharves , where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the city million lights began to twinkle out over the water .
ever new seemed this deathless city of vision , for here time has no power to tarnish or destroy .
as it has always been is still the turquoise of , and the eighty priests are the same who builded it ten thousand years ago .
shining still is the bronze of the great gates , nor are the onyx pavements ever worn or broken .
and the great bronze statues on the walls look down on merchants and camel drivers older than fable , yet without one grey hair in their forked beards .
carter did not once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel , but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors .
and when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well , and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown kadath whom he sought .
the next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of inquanok , but was told that none were now in port , their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks .
he found , however , one thorabonian sailor who had been to inquanok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place ; and this sailor said there was certainly a descent to the north of the peopled region , which everybody seemed to fear and shun .
the thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into leng horrible plateau , and that this was why men feared it ; though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels .
whether or not this could be the fabled waste wherein unknown kadath stands he did not know ; but it seemed unlikely that those presences and sentinels , if indeed they existed , were stationed for nought .
on the following day carter walked up the street of the pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the .
though is chiefly worshipped in celephais , all the great ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers ; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods .
like atal in distant ulthar , he strongly advised against any attempts to see them ; declaring that they are testy and capricious , and subject to strange protection from the mindless other gods from outside , whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish carter to reach it , and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them .
no man had ever found kadath in the past , and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future .
such rumours as were told about that onyx castle of the great ones were not by any means reassuring .
having thanked the , carter left the temple and sought out the bazaar of the , where the old chief of celephais ' cats dwelt sleek and contented .
that grey and dignified being was sunning himself on the onyx pavement , and extended a languid paw as his caller approached .
but when carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of ulthar , the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative ; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of .
best of all , he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of celephais about the men of inquanok , on whose dark ships no cat will go .
it seems that these men have an aura not of earth about them , though that is not the reason why no cat will sail on their ships .
the reason for this is that inquanok holds shadows which no cat can endure , so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew .
whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical leng , or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north , none may say ; but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like , and to which they are more sensitive than men .
therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of inquanok .
the old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend king kuranes , who in carter latter dreams had reigned alternately in the palace of the seventy delights at celephais and in the turreted of serannian .
it seemed that he could no more find content in those places , but had formed a mighty longing for the english cliffs and downlands of his boyhood ; where in little dreaming villages england old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows , and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys .
he could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead ; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the to the foot of the tanarian hills .
there he dwelt in a grey gothic of stone looking on the sea , and tried to think it was ancient trevor towers , where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light .
and on the coast nearby he had built a little cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways , settling therein such people as had the most english faces , and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old cornwall fishers .
and in a valley not far off he had reared a great norman abbey whose tower he could see from his window , placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon , and with a moss somewhat like old england moss .
for though kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream , with all imagined pomps and marvels , splendours and beauties , ecstasies and delights , novelties and excitements at his command , he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet england , that ancient , beloved england which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a part .
so when carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu , he did not seek the terraced palace of rose crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the .
and in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge , and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and annointed lackey of the palace , but a small stubby old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far cornwall .
and carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to england trees , and clumbed the terraces among gardens set out as in queen anne time .
at the door , flanked by stone cats in the old way , he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery ; and was presently taken to the library where kuranes , lord of and the sky around serannian , sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little seacoast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful at the vicar , with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patience .
kuranes , clad in a dressing gown of the sort favoured by london tailors in his youth , rose eagerly to meet his guest ; for the sight of an from the waking world was very dear to him , even if it was a saxon from boston , massachusetts , instead of from cornwall .
and for long they talked of old times , having much to say because both were old dreamers and well versed in the wonders of incredible places .
kuranes , indeed , had been out beyond the stars in the ultimate void , and was said to be the only one who had ever returned sane from such a voyage .
at length carter brought up the subject of his quest , and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others .
kuranes did not know where kadath was , or the marvellous sunset city ; but he did know that the great ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out , and that the other gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity .
he had learned much of the other gods in distant parts of space , especially in that region where form does not exist , and coloured gases study the innermost secrets .
the violet gas had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos nyarlathotep , and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark .
altogether , it was not well to meddle with the elder ones ; and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city , it were better not to seek that city .
kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it .
he himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely celephais and the land of , and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains , and conventions , and stupidities .
but now that he was come into that city and that land , and was the king thereof , he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out , and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories .
he was a king in , but found no meaning therein , and drooped always for the old familiar things of england that had shaped his youth .
all his kingdom would he give for the sound of cornish church bells over the downs , and all the thousand minarets of celephais for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home .
so he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite that content he sought , and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and half remembered dream .
for he had visited carter often in the old waking days , and knew well the lovely new england slopes that had given him birth .
at the last , he was very certain , the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes ; the glow of beacon hill at evening , the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint kingsport , the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and arkham , and the blessed meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure .
these things he told randolph carter , but still the seeker held to his purpose .
and in the end they parted each with his own conviction , and carter went back through the bronze gate into celephais and down the street of pillars to the old sea wall , where he talked more with the mariners of far ports and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight inquanok , whose sailors and had in them the blood of the great ones .
one starlit evening when the pharos shone splendid over the harbour the ship put in , and sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea wall .
it was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features of ngranek , but carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen .
he did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the great ones , and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land .
they talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea taverns ; but would gather in groups in remote comers and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places , or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland .
and so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened , even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody .
for a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of celephais , and before they sailed carter had taken passage on their dark ship , telling them that he was an old onyx miner and wishful to work in their quarries .
that ship was very lovey and cunningly wrought , being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold , and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet .
one morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lilted , and as carter stood on the high stern he saw the walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless celephais sink into the distance , and the snowy peak of mount man grow smaller and smaller .
by noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the cerenerian sea , with one painted galley afar off bound for that realm of serannian where the sea meets the sky .
and the night came with gorgeous stars , and the dark ship steered for charles ' wain and the little bear as they swung slowly round the pole .
and the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places , and they stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea .
carter went to sleep at midnight , and rose in the glow of a young morning , marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont .
and all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship , getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land , of their exquisite onyx city , and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which leng was said to be .
they told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of inquanok , and how they thought the hidden nearness of leng was to blame for it .
only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk .
there was something disquieting about that desert , and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence .
on later days they talked of the quarries in which carter said he was going to work .
there were many of them , for all the city of inquanok was builded of onyx , whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in rinar , ogrothan , and celephais and at home with the merchants of thraa , flarnek , and kadatheron , for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports .
and far to the north , almost in the cold desert whose existence the men of inquanok did not care to admit , there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest ; from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld .
who had mined those incredible blocks , and whither they had been transported , no man might say ; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry , around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling .
so it was left all alone in the twilight , with only the raven and the rumoured to brood on its immensities .
when carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought , for he knew from old tales that the great ones ' castle atop unknown kadath is of onyx .
each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky , and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker .
and in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all , but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day , and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night .
on the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar , the first land glimpsed since man snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship .
carter asked the captain the name of that rock , but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night .
and when , after dark , a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place , the traveller was glad that no stop had been made , and that the rock had no name .
the seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot , and carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours .
two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world .
and at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs , and some knelt down on the deck to pray , so that carter knew they were come to the land of inquanok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that land name .
toward noon a dark coastline appeared , and before three there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city .
rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays , all of delicate black with scrolls , flutings , and arabesques of inlaid gold .
tall and were the houses , and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light .
some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point , others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination .
the walls were low , and pierced by frequent gates , each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant ngranek .
on a hill in the centre rose a tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome .
this , the seamen said , was the temple of the elder ones , and was ruled by an old sad with inner secrets .
at intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city , answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns , viols , and chanting voices .
and from a row of tripods on a galley round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments ; for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries , and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the great ones as set forth in scrolls older than the pnakotic manuscripts .
as the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest , and carter saw the slaves , sailors , and merchants on the docks .
the sailors and merchants were of the race of the gods , but the slaves were squat , slant eyed folk said by rumour to have drifted somehow across or around the impassable peaks from the valleys beyond leng .
the wharves reached wide outside the city wall and bore upon them all manner of merchandise from the galleys anchored there , while at one end were great piles of onyx both carved and uncarved awaiting shipment to the far markets of rinar , ograthan and celephais .
it was not yet evening when the dark ship anchored beside a jutting quay of stone , and all the sailors and traders filed ashore and through the arched gate into the city .
the streets of that city were paved with onyx and some of them were wide and straight whilst others were crooked and narrow .
the houses near the water were lower than the rest , and bore above their curiously arched doorways certain signs of gold said to be in honour of the respective small gods that favoured each .
the captain of the ship took carter to an old sea tavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries , and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city , and lead him to the taverns of the by the northern wall .
and evening fell , and little bronze lamps were lighted , and the sailors in that tavern sang songs of remote places .
but when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city , and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto , all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away .
for there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of inquanok , and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close .
far in the shadows of that tavern carter saw a squat form he did not like , for it was unmistakably that of the old merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of , who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar , and even to have dealt with that not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery .
this man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when carter asked the traders of dylathleen about the cold waste and kadath ; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted inquanok , so close to the wonders of the north , was not a reassuring thing .
he slipped wholly out of sight before carter could speak to him , and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined , bearing the colossal and eggs of the rumoured to trade for the dextrous jade goblets that merchants brought from ilarnek .
on the following morning the led carter through the onyx streets of inquanok , dark under their twilight sky .
the inlaid doors and figured , carven balconies and oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness ; and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars , colonades , and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous .
some of the vistas down long and unbending streets , or through side alleys and over bulbous domes , spires , and arabesqued roofs , were weird and beautiful beyond words ; and nothing was more splendid than the massive heights of the great central temple of the elder ones with its sixteen carven sides , its flattened dome , and its lofty pinnacled belfry , overtopping all else , and majestic whatever its foreground .
and always to the east , far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land , rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous leng was said to lie .
the captain took carter to the mighty temple , which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheel hub .
the seven arched gates of that garden , each having over it a carven face like those on the city gates , are always open , and the people roam reverently at will down the tiled paths and through the little lanes lined with grotesque termini and the shrines of modest gods .
and there are fountains , pools , and basins there to reflect the frequent blaze of the tripods on the high balcony , all of onyx and having in them small luminous fish taken by divers from the lower bowers of ocean .
when the deep clang from the temple belfry shivers over the garden and the city , and the answer of the horns and viols and voices peals out from the seven lodges by the garden gates , there issue from the seven doors of the temple long columns of masked and hooded priests in black , bearing at arm length before them great golden bowls from which a curious steam rises .
and all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file , legs thrown far forward without bending the knees , down the walks that lead to the seven lodges , wherein they disappear and do not appear again .
it is said that subterrene paths connect the lodges with the temple , and that the long files of priests return through them ; nor is it unwhispered that deep flights of onyx steps go down to mysteries that are never told .
but only a few are those who hint that the priests in the masked and hooded columns are not human beings .
carter did not enter the temple , because none but the veiled king is permitted to do that .
but before he left the garden the hour of the bell came , and he heard the shivering clang deafening above him , and the wailing of the horns and viols and voices loud from the lodges by the gates .
and down the seven great walks stalked the long files of priests in their singular way , giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give .
when the last of them had vanished he left that garden , noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed .
even the did not like that spot , and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the veiled king palace rises and marvellous .
the ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow , all but the broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak drawn chariots .
carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps , between inlaid walls hearing strange signs in gold , and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance .
always ahead loomed those titan walls , mighty buttresses , and clustered and bulbous domes for which the veiled king palace is famous ; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarch pleasure .
there carter paused in faintness at so much beauty , for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks , the gay porterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices , the brazen urns and tripods with cunning , the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble , the lagoon tiled fountains with luminous fish , the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns , the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates , and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality , and even in the land of dreams .
there it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky , with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead , and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right .
and ever the small birds and the fountains sang , while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden .
no other human presence was there , and carter was glad it was so .
then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps , for the palace itself no visitor may enter ; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome , since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured , and to send out queer dreams to the curious .
after that the captain took carter to the north quarter of the town , near the gate of the caravans , where are the taverns of the yak merchants and the .
and there , in a inn of quarrymen , they said farewell ; for business called the captain whilst carter was eager to talk with miners about the north .
there were many men in that inn , and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them ; saying that he was an old miner of onyx , and anxious to know somewhat of inquanok quarries .
but all that he learned was not much more than he knew before , for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits .
they had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where leng is said to lie , and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks .
and they whispered also that the rumoured are no wholesome things ; it being .
indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one ( for that fabled father of shantaks in the king dome is fed in the dark ) .
the next day , saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of inquanok , carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern for a journey .
beyond the gate of the caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields , with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes .
at some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions ; once finding a host so austere and reticent , and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on ngranek , that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the great ones themselves , or upon one with full of their blood , dwelling amongst men .
and to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods , and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded him .
that night carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath tree to which he tied his yak , and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage .
at about ten he reached the village of urg , where traders rest and miners tell their tales , and paused in its taverns till noon .
it is here that the great caravan road turns west toward selarn , but carter kept on north by the quarry road .
all the afternoon he followed that rising road , which was somewhat narrower than the great highway , and which now led through a region with more rocks than tilled fields .
and by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizable black cliffs , so that he knew he was close to the mining country .
all the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right , and the farther he went , the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering along the way .
on the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag , tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground .
he observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at his northerly point , and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them .
and on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry , and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels .
before evening he had passed eleven quarries ; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders , with no vegetation at all , but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth , with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right .
the third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west .
and they sang many songs and told many tales , shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the great ones .
they asked him whither he went , and cautioned him not to go too far to the north ; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx , and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors .
in the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north , where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than men hands had wrenched prodigious blocks .
but he did not like it when , turning back to wave a last farewell , he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes , whose conjectured traffick with leng was the gossip of distant .
after two more quarries the inhabited part of inquanok seemed to end , and the road narrowed to a steeply rising among forbidding black cliffs .
always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks , and as carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder .
soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath , and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time .
once in a while a raven would croak far overhead , and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured .
but in the main he was alone with his shaggy steed , and it troubled him to observe that this excellent yak became more and more reluctant to advance , and more and more disposed to snort affrightedly at any small noise along the route .
the path now contracted between sable and glistening walls , and began to display an even greater steepness than before .
it was a bad footing , and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strewn thickly about .
in two hours carter saw ahead a definite crest , beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky , and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course .
to reach this crest , however , was no easy task ; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular , and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones .
eventually carter dismounted and led his dubious yak ; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled , and keeping his own footing as best he might .
then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond , and gasped at what he saw .
the path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down , with the same lines of high natural walls as before ; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space , vast acres in extent , where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giant quarry .
far back into the solid precipice ran that cyclopean gouge , and deep down within earth bowels its lower delvings yawned .
it was no quarry of man , and the concave sides were scarred with great squares , yards wide , which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels .
high over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked , and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness .
there carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him ; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry .
all at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control , leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north .
stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom ; but carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed .
soon the left behind cliffs resumed their course , making the way once more a narrow lane ; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flight .
once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast , and doubled his speed from this encouragement .
he was covering miles , and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north .
the gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the crags , and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark arid limitless plain .
and once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears , plainer than before , but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak .
the beats were ruthless and purposeful , and they were behind him .
carter pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing , for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable .
his yak must have heard or felt it first , and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit .
meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind , so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost .
he could not see the hoofprints of his yak , but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping ; mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings .
that he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him , and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands .
only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction , and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place .
then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing .
he had thought it for some moments a range of black mountains , but now he saw it was something more .
the phosphorescence of the brooding clouds shewed it plainly , and even silhouetted parts of it as vapours glowed behind .
how distant it was he could not tell , but it must have been very far .
it was thousands of feet high , stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces , and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills .
but now these hills were hills no more , for some hand greater than man had touched them .
silent they squatted there atop the world like wolves or ghouls , crowned with clouds and mists and guarding the secrets of the north forever .
all in a great half circle they squatted , those mountains carven into monstrous watching statues , and their right hands were raised in menace against mankind .
it was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move , but as carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy caps great forms whose motions were no delusion .
winged and whirring , those forms grew larger each moment , and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end .
they were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland , for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horse .
carter knew that they must be the of ill rumour , and wondered no more what evil guardians and nameless sentinels made men avoid the boreal rock desert .
and as he stopped in final resignation he dared at last to look behind him , where indeed was trotting the squat trader of evil legend , grinning astride a lean yak and leading on a noxious horde of leering shantaks to whose wings still clung the rime and nitre of the nether pits .
trapped though he was by fabulous and hippocephalic winged nightmares that pressed around in great unholy circles , randolph carter did not lose consciousness .
lofty and horrible those titan gargoyles towered above him , while the merchant leaped down from his yak and stood grinning before the captive .
then the man motioned carter to mount one of the repugnant shantaks , helping him up as his judgement struggled with his loathing .
it was hard work ascending , for the has scales instead of feathers , and those scales are very slippery .
once he was seated , the man hopped up behind him , leaving the lean yak to be led away northward toward the ring of carven mountains by one of the incredible bird colossi .
there now followed a hideous whirl through frigid space , endlessly up and eastward toward the gaunt grey flanks of those impassable mountains beyond which leng was said to be .
far above the clouds they flew , till at last there lay beneath them those fabled summits which the folk of inquanok have never seen , and which lie always in high vortices of gleaming mist .
carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below , and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on ngranek ; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them , hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear .
the shantak now flew lower , revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires .
as they descended there appeared at intervals lone huts of granite and bleak stone villages whose tiny windows glowed with pallid light .
and there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that inquanok people are right in their geographic rumours .
for travellers have heard such sounds before , and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit ; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is leng .
around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing , and carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be ; for no healthy folk have ever been to leng , and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar .
very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap , and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold ; so that carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend , or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau .
as the shantak flew lower , the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity ; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before .
they leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet , and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns .
of other clothing they had none , but most of them were quite furry .
behind they had dwarfish tails , and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths .
then he knew what they were , and that they did not wear any wigs or headpieces after all .
for the cryptic folk of leng were of one race with the uncomfortable merchants of the black galleys that traded rubies at ; those not quite human merchants who are the slaves of the monstrous !
they were indeed the same dark folk who had shanghaied carter on their noisome galley so long ago , and whose kith he had seen driven in herds about the unclean wharves of that accursed lunar city , with the leaner ones toiling and the fatter ones taken away in crates for other needs of their polypous and amorphous masters .
now he saw where such ambiguous creatures came from , and shuddered at the thought that leng must be known to these formless abominations from the moon .
but the shantak flew on past the fires and the stone huts and the less than human dancers , and soared over sterile hills of grey granite and dim wastes of rock and ice and snow .
day came , and the phosphorescence of low clouds gave place to the misty twilight of that northern world , and still the vile bird winged meaningly through the cold and silence .
at times the man talked with his steed in a hateful and guttural language , and the shantak would answer with tittering tones that rasped like the scratching of ground glass .
ali this while the land was getting higher , and finally they came to a table land which seemed the very roof of a blasted and tenantless world .
there , all alone in the hush and the dusk and the cold , rose the uncouth stones of a squat windowless building , around which a circle of crude monoliths stood .
in all this arrangement there was nothing human , and carter surmised from old tales that he was indeed come to that most dreadful and legendary of all places , the remote and prehistoric monastery wherein dwells uncompanioned the not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and prays to the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
the loathsome bird now settled to the ground , and the man hopped down and helped his captive alight .
of the purpose of his seizure carter now felt very sure ; for clearly the merchant was an agent of the darker powers , eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the great ones in their onyx castle .
it seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the in , and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled ; taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown kadath had been tried .
leng and the cold waste north of inquanok must be close to the other gods , and there the passes to kadath are well guarded .
the man was small , but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed ; so carter followed where he led , and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery .
there were no lights inside , but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors .
on the walls of the corridors were printed frightful scenes older than history , and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth .
after countless aeons their pigments were brilliant still , for the cold and dryness of hideous leng keep alive many primal things .
carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp , and shuddered at the tale they told .
through those archaic frescoes leng annals stalked ; and the horned , hooved , and danced evilly amidst forgotten cities .
there were scenes of old wars , wherein leng fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales ; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon , and of the submission of leng people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them .
those slippery blasphemies they worshipped as gods , nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys .
the monstrous made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea , and carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to inquanok ; that grey accursed rock which inquanok seamen shun , and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night .
and in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the ; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves , and wondrous with high fanes and carven places .
great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six gates to a vast central plaza , and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase .
again and again were those huge winged lions shewn , their mighty flanks of diarite glistening in the grey twilight of the day and the cloudy phosphorescence of the night .
and as carter stumbled past their frequent and repeated pictures it came to him at last what indeed they were , and what city it was that the had ruled so anciently before the coming of the black galleys .
there could be no mistake , for the legends of dreamland are generous and profuse .
indubitably that primal city was no less a place than storied sarkomand , whose ruins had bleached for a million years before the first true human saw the light , and whose twin titan lions guard eternally the steps that lead down from dreamland to the great abyss .
other views shewed the gaunt grey peaks dividing leng from inquanok , and the monstrous that build nests on the ledges half way up .
and they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles , and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them .
carter had seen those caves when he passed over them , and had noticed their likeness to the caves on ngranek .
now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one , for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens ; and those , curving horns , barbed tails , prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him .
he had met those silent , flitting and clutching creatures before ; those mindless guardians of the great abyss whom even the great ones fear , and who own not nyarlathotep but hoary nodens as their lord .
for they were the dreaded , who never laugh or smile because they have no faces , and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the vale of pnath and the passes to the outer world .
the merchant had now prodded carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking , and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring .
there was no light in this vast crypt , and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little .
at the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps ; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face .
to this being the slant eyed man made certain signs with his hands , and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask .
this colloquy went on for some time , and to carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place .
it made him think of a frightful city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it ; of that , and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond , before the rescuing rush of earth friendly cats .
he knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high priest not to be described , of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities , but he feared to think just what that abhorred might be .
then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the paws , and carter knew what the noisome was .
and in that hideous second , stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt , for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne .
he knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold outside , and that even on that the noxious shantek still waited ; yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling , monstrosity .
the man had set the curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained by the pit , and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the with his hands .
carter , hitherto wholly passive , now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear , so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish vaults of zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark .
in almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths , racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him , or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors .
after a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste , and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in .
true , they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good , but he wished none the less he had made the attempt .
those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then , and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside .
in time he became quite sure he was not followed , and slackened his pace somewhat ; but scarce had he breathed in half relief when a new peril beset him .
his lamp was waning , and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance .
when the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark , and prayed to the great ones for such help as they might afford .
at times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down , and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist .
the farther he went the damper it seemed to be , and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least .
he believed , though , that his general course was down ; and the smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in leng unwholesome .
but there was not any warning of the thing which came at last ; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and chaos .
one moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place , and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been vertical .
of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure , but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy .
then he realized he was still , with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him .
all around were crumbling walls and broken columns , and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots .
behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular ; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes , and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come .
ahead stretched double rows of pillars , and the fragments and pedestals of pillars , that spoke of a broad and bygone street ; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens .
far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza , and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things .
huge winged lions of diarite they were , with blackness and shadow between them .
full twenty feet they reared their grotesque and unbroken heads , and snarled derisive on the ruins around them .
and carter knew right well what they must be , for legend tells of only one such twain .
they were the changeless guardians of the great abyss , and these dark ruins were in truth primordial sarkomand .
carter first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around .
he wished no follower from leng hateful monastery , for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers .
of how to get from sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all ; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls , since he knew they were no better informed than he .
the three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach sarkomand in their journey back , but had planned to ask old traders in .
he did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of koth with its cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood , yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed .
over leng plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided ; for the emissaries must be many , while at the journey end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with .
if he could get a boat he might sail back to inquanok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea , for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from sarkomand basalt quays .
but to find a boat in this city was no probable thing , and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one .
such were the thoughts of randolph carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind .
all this while there had stretched before him the great width of fabled sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds .
now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for , and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city .
the glow rose and fell fitfully , flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher .
and when he crept closer , down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls , he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it ; and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all .
beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor , and carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon .
then , just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame , he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound .
it was the frightened meeping of a ghoul , and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish .
secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins , carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear , and crept forward again instead of retreating .
once in crossing an open street he wriggled on his stomach , and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble .
but always he succeeded in avoiding discovery , so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar where he could watch the whole scene of action .
there around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi , there squatted a stinking circle of the toadlike moonbeasts and their slaves .
some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames , and at intervals applying their white hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party .
from the motions of their tentacles carter could see that the moonbeasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely , and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss , and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps .
the number of malodorous moonbeasts about that greenish fire was very great , and carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies .
of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess ; but fancied that the grey toadlike blasphemies had heard them inquire in concerning the way to sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of leng and the not to be described .
for a moment he pondered on what he ought to do , and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls ' black kingdom .
clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf , where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above , and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moonbeasts from the black galley .
it occurred to him that the portal , like other gates to the abyss , might be guarded by flocks of ; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now .
he had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls , and the ghoul which was pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understood .
so carter began another silent crawl through the ruins , edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions .
it was ticklish work , but the moonbeasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones .
at last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunned trees and vines that had grown up therein .
the gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds , but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces , knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard .
ten feet apart crouched the beasts of diarite , brooding on cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled in fearsome .
betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx .
midway in this space a black well opened , and carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare .
terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs .
so worn and narrow were the steps , and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth , that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits ; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian would suddenly pounce upon him , if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage .
all about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs , and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind .
in time he became very numb and somnolent , moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will ; nor did he realize any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind .
he was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery had performed their duty .
awaked to the fact that he was in the cold , damp clutch of the faceless flutterers , carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight .
mindless though are said to be , the effect was instantaneous ; for all tickling stopped at once , and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position .
thus encouraged carter ventured some explanations ; telling of the seizure and torture of three ghouls by the moonbeasts , and of the need of assembling a party to rescue them .
the , though inarticulate , seemed to understand what was said ; and shewed greater haste and purpose in their flight .
suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth , and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw .
scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place ; and as carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons , a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery , tenants .
the now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet , afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer .
carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company , and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for a rescue .
after a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared , and made significant signs to the , causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark .
thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of on the plain , till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them .
meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one , all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled night gaunts .
in time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist richard pickman of boston , and to him carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred .
the erstwhile pickman , pleased to greet his ancient friend again , seemed very much impressed , and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throng .
finally , after scanning the ranks with care , the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and .
a large detachment of the horned flyers vanished at once , while the rest grouped themselves two by two on their knees with extended forelegs , awaiting the approach of the ghouls one by one .
as each ghoul reached the pair of to which he was assigned , he was taken up and borne away into the blackness ; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for carter , pickman , and the other chiefs , and a few pairs of .
pickman explained that night gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls , and that the army was issuing forth to sarkomand to deal with the moonbeasts .
then carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp , slippery paws .
another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness ; endlessly up , up , up to the gate of the winged and the special ruins of primal sarkomand .
when , after a great interval , carter saw again the sickly light of sarkomand nocturnal sky , it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and .
day , he felt sure , must be almost due ; but so strong was the army that no surprise of the enemy would be needed .
the greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly , though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce .
softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless ahead , the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame .
carter was now beside pickman in the front rank of ghouls , and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moonbeasts were totally unprepared .
the three prisoners lay bound and inert beside the fire , while their toadlike captors slumped drowsily about in no certain order .
the slaves were asleep , even the sentinels shirking a duty which in this realm must have seemed to them merely perfunctory .
the final swoop of the and mounted ghouls was very sudden , each of the greyish toadlike blasphemies and their slaves being seized by a group of before a sound was made .
the moonbeasts , of course , were voiceless ; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence .
horrible were the writhings of those great jellyfish abnormalities as the sardonic clutched them , but nothing availed against the strength of those black prehensile talons .
when a moonbeast writhed too violently , a would seize and pull its quivering pink tentacles ; which seemed to hurt so much that the victim would cease its struggles .
carter expected to see much slaughter , but found that the ghouls were far subtler in their plans .
they glibbered certain simple orders to the which held the captives , trusting the rest to instinct ; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the great abyss , to be distributed impartially amongst the dholes , gugs , ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims .
meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk , whilst various parties searched the neighborhood for possible remaining moonbeasts , and boarded the black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat .
surely enough , the capture had been thorough , for not a sign of further life could the victors detect .
carter , anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland , urged them not to sink the anchored galley ; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio .
on the ship were found some very curious objects and decorations , some of which carter cast at once into the sea .
ghouls and now formed themselves in separate groups , the former questioning their rescued fellow anent past happenings .
it appeared that the three had followed carter directions and proceeded from the enchanted wood to by way of nir and the skin , stealing human clothes at a lonely farmhouse and loping as closely as possible in the fashion of a man walk .
in taverns their grotesque ways and faces had aroused much comment ; but they had persisted in asking the way to sarkomand until at last an old traveller was able to tell them .
then they knew that only a ship for would serve their purpose , and prepared to wait patiently for such a vessel .
but evil spies had doubtless reported much ; for shortly a black galley put into port , and the ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern .
wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby , and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as carter had found himself .
this time , however , the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique sarkomand ; bent evidently on taking their captives before the not to be described .
they had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which inquanok mariners shun , and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the red masters of the ship ; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour .
there , too , were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toadlike resident pastimes as give rise to the which men fear .
after that had come the landing at ruined sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures , whose continuance the present rescue had prevented .
future plans were next discussed , the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toadlike garrison there .
to this , however , the objected ; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them .
most of the ghouls favoured the design , but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged .
thereupon carter , seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley , offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars ; to which proposal they eagerly assented .
grey day had now come , and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers ' benches .
carter found them fairly apt at learning , and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour .
not till three days later , however , did he deem it safe to attempt the voyage of conquest .
then , the rowers trained and the safely stowed in the forecastle , the party set sail at last ; pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing models of approach and procedure .
on the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard .
such was their timbre that all the galley crew shook visibly ; but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant .
it was not thought best to attempt an attack by night , so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day .
when the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes , and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky .
the sides of the rock were very steep ; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings , and the low railings guarding travelled highroads .
no ship of men had ever come so near the place , or at least , had never come so near and departed again ; but carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on , rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands .
the headlands were prolongations of the island proper , and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them .
there seemed to be no watchers on the outside , so the galley was steered boldly through the strait and into the stagnant putrid harbour beyond .
here , however , all was bustle and activity ; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay , and scores of slaves and moonbeasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries .
there was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves , with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock .
of what lay inside that prodigious peak of granite none might say , but the things one saw on the outside were far from encouraging .
at sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness ; those with eyes staring intently , and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly .
they did not , of course , realize that the black ship had changed hands ; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved , and the were all out of sight below .
by this time the leaders had fully formed a plan ; which was to loose the as soon as the wharf was touched , and then to sail directly away , leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those creatures .
marooned on the rock , the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there , and afterward , quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct , would forget their fears of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss ; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark , from which not much would emerge alive .
the ghoul that was pickman now went below and gave the their simple instructions , while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves .
presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront , and carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion .
evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock , and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the slaves whose places they were taking .
some silent alarm must have been given , for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moonbeasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right .
a rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another ; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and cyclopean bats .
the jellyish moonbeasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship , but when the struck them they thought of such things no more .
it was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime , and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above .
sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toadlike prisoner from aloft by mistake , and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell .
when the last of the had left the galley the ghoulish leaders glibbered an order of withdrawal , and the rowers pulled quietly out of the harbour between the grey headlands while still the town was a chaos of battle and conquest .
the pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea , and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited , and dressed the wounds of the injured men .
night fell , and the grey twilight gave place to the sickly phosphorescence of low clouds , and all the while the leaders watched the high peaks of that accursed rock for signs of the ' flight .
toward morning a black speck was seen hovering timidly over the pinnacle , and shortly afterward the speck had become a swarm .
just before daybreak the swarm seemed to scatter , and within a quarter of an hour it had vanished wholly in the distance toward the northeast .
once or twice something seemed to fall from the thing swarm into the sea ; but carter did not worry , since he knew from observation that the toadlike moonbeasts can not swim .
at length , when the ghouls were satisfied that all the had left for sarkomand and the great abyss with their doomed burdens , the galley put back into the harbour betwixt the grey headlands ; and all the hideous company landed and roamed curiously over the denuded rock with its towers and eyries and fortresses chiselled from the solid stone .
frightful were the secrets uncovered in those evil and windowless crypts ; for the remnants of unfinished pastimes were many , and in various stages of departure from their primal state .
carter put out of the way certain things which were after a fashion alive , and fled precipitately from a few other things about which he could not be very positive .
the houses were furnished mostly with grotesque stools and benches carven from , and were painted inside with nameless and frantic designs .
countless weapons , implements , and ornaments lay about , including some large idols of solid ruby depicting singular beings not found on the earth .
these latter did not , despite their material , invite either appropriation or long inspection ; and carter took the trouble to hammer five of them into very small pieces .
the scattered spears and javelins he collected , and with pickman approval distributed among the ghouls .
such devices were new to the doglike lopers , but their relative simplicity made them easy to master after a few concise hints .
the upper parts of the rock held more temples than private homes , and in numerous hewn chambers were found terrible carven altars and doubtfully stained fonts and shrines for the worship of things more monstrous than the wild gods atop kadath .
from the rear of one great temple stretched a low black passage which carter followed far into the rock with a torch till he came to a lightless domed hall of vast proportions , whose vaultings were covered with demoniac carvings and in whose centre yawned a foul and bottomless well like that in the hideous monastery of leng where broods alone the not to be described .
on the distant shadowy side , beyond the noisome well , he thought he discerned a small door of strangely wrought bronze ; but for some reason he felt an unaccountable dread of opening it or even approaching it , and hastened back through the cavern to his unlovely allies as they shambled about with an ease and abandon he could scarcely feel .
the ghouls had observed the unfinished pastimes of the moonbeasts , and had profited in their fashion .
they had also found a hogshead of potent , and were rolling it down to the wharves for removal and later use in diplomatic dealings , though the rescued trio , remembering its effect on them in , had warned their company to taste none of it .
of rubies from lunar mines there was a great store , both rough and polished , in one of the vaults near the water ; but when the ghouls found they were not good to eat they lost all interest in them .
carter did not try to carry any away , since he knew too much about those which had mined them .
suddenly there came an excited meeping from the sentries on the wharves , and all the loathsome foragers turned from their tasks to stare seaward and cluster round the waterfront .
betwixt the grey headlands a fresh black galley was rapidly advancing , and it would be but a moment before the on deck would perceive the invasion of the town and give the alarm to the monstrous things below .
fortunately the ghouls still bore the spears and javelins which carter had distributed amongst them ; and at his command , sustained by the being that was pickman , they now formed a line of battle and prepared to prevent the landing of the ship .
presently a burst of excitement on the galley told of the crew discovery of the changed state of things , and the instant stoppage of the vessel proved that the superior numbers of the ghouls had been noted and taken into account .
after a moment of hesitation the new comers silently turned and passed out between the headlands again , but not for an instant did the ghouls imagine that the conflict was averted .
either the dark ship would seek reinforcements or the crew would try to land elsewhere on the island ; hence a party of scouts was at once sent up toward the pinnacle to see what the enemy course would be .
in a very few minutes the ghoul returned breathless to say that the moonbeasts and were landing on the outside of the more easterly of the rugged grey headlands , and ascending by hidden paths and ledges which a goat could scarcely tread in safety .
almost immediately afterward the galley was sighted again through the strait , but only for a second .
then a few moments later , a second messenger panted down from aloft to say that another party was landing on the other headland ; both being much more numerous than the size of the galley would seem to allow for .
the ship itself , moving slowly with only one sparsely manned tier of oars , soon hove in sight betwixt the cliffs , and lay to in the foetid harbour as if to watch the coming fray and stand by for any possible use .
by this time carter and pickman had divided the ghouls into three parties , one to meet each of the two invading columns and one to remain in the town .
the first two at once scrambled up the rocks in their respective directions , while the third was subdivided into a land party and a sea party .
the sea party , commanded by carter , boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the galley of the newcomers ; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea .
carter did not at once pursue it , for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town .
meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moonbeasts and had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky .
the thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine , and the general effect of those hybrid , processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toadlike lunar blasphemies .
then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama .
javelins began to fly from both sides , and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony .
now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside , in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles .
for half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky , till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated .
on the east cliff , however , where the leader of the moonbeast party appeared to be present , the ghouls had not fared so well ; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper .
pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town , and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat .
then , when the western battle was over , the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their fellows ; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland .
the were by this time all slain , but the last of the toadlike horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws .
the time for javelins was now nearly past , and the fight became a contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge .
as fury and recklessness increased , the number falling into the sea became very great .
those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers , but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks , while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moonbeasts .
the cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked , so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their .
some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moonbeasts above , but a few survived to be rescued .
when the security of the land parties seemed assured , carter galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea ; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean .
several moonbeasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way .
finally , the moonbeast galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place , carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemy rear ; after which the fight was indeed .
attacked from both sides , the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea , till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them .
the hostile galley , meanwhile , had disappeared ; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors .
so by night pickman and carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care , finding that over a fourth had been lost in the day battles .
the wounded were placed on bunks in the galley , for pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating one own wounded , and the troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill .
under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed , and carter was not sorry to be departing from the island of unwholesome secrets , whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy .
dawn found the ship in sight of sarkomand ruined quays of basalt , where a few sentries still waited , squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man .
the ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of sarkomand , despatching a messenger for enough to serve them as steeds .
pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid carter had lent them .
carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well , and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland , but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown kadath , and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers .
accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders ; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into images which guard it .
he spoke of the fear of shantaks for , and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide inquanok from hateful leng .
he spoke , too , of the things he had learned concerning from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the not to be described ; how even the great ones fear them , and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos nyarlathotep at all , but hoary and immemorial nodens , lord of the great abyss .
all these things carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls , and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery doglike lopers .
he wished very much , he said , for the services of enough to bear him safely through the aft past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains , and up into the old waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal .
he desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste to plead with the great ones for the sunset city they denied him , and felt sure that the could take him thither without trouble ; high above the perils of the plain , and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk .
for the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the great ones themselves dread them .
and even were unexpected things to come from the other gods , who are prone to oversee the affairs of earth milder gods , the need not fear ; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not nyarlathotep for their master , but bow only to potent and archaic nodens .
a flock of ten or fifteen , carter glibbered , would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance , though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures , their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men .
the party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have , waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth .
if any ghouls chose to escort him into the of the great ones , he would be thankful , for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea .
he would not , however , insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown kadath ; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself , in case of gods proved favourable , or back to the earthward gate of deeper slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless .
whilst carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention , and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those for which messengers had been sent .
the winged steeds settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army , waiting respectfully as the doglike chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller .
the ghoul that was pickman glibbered gravely with his fellows and in the end carter was offered far more than he had at most expected .
as he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moonbeasts , so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned ; lending him not merely a few of their allied , but their entire army as then encamped , veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled alike , save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea .
they would set out through the aft whenever he might wish , and once arrived on kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earth gods in their onyx castle .
moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words , carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage .
the army would fly high , they decided , over hideous leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages ; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the whose burrows honeycombed their summits .
they would then , according to what advice they might receive from those denizens , choose their final course ; approaching unknown kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of inquanok , or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive leng itself .
doglike and soulless as they are , the ghouls and had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal ; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery .
about midday the ghouls and prepared for flight , each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him .
carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside pickman , and in front of the whole a double line of riderless was provided as a vanguard .
at a brisk meep from pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial sarkomand ; higher and higher , till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared , and the cold , sterile of leng outskirts laid open to sight .
still higher flew the black host , till even this grew small beneath them ; and as they worked northward over the plateau of horror carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped .
this time no descent was made as the army swept batlike over the sterile landscape , passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude , and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved , horned that dance and pipe eternally therein .
once they saw a flying low over the plain , but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic .
at dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of inquanok , and hovered about these strange caves near the summits which carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks .
at the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers with which the ghouls and of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures .
it soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of inquanok , for leng northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the dislike ; abysmal influences centering in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls , which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
of kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing , save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north , over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard .
they hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond , and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally ; but of definite data they had nothing to give .
so carter and his party thanked them kindly ; and , crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of inquanok , dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock .
there they squatted in a hellish , their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds ; sinister , wolflike , and , with faces of fury and right hands raised , dully and malignly watching the rim of man world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not man .
from their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk , but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of was sighted in the misty sky .
northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew , and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose .
less and less luminous grew the clouds , till at length carter could see only blackness around him ; but never did the winged steeds falter , bred as they were in earth blackest crypts , and seeing not with any eyes , but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms .
on and on they flew , past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import ; ever in thickest darkness , and covering such prodigious spaces that carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earth dreamland .
then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above .
all below was still black , but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere .
it was not that the figures of the constellations were different , but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain .
everything focussed toward the north ; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead .
carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of inquanok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence .
it was more broken now , with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles ; and carter studied closely the suggestive turnings and inclinations of that grotesque outline , which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge .
they were flying past at a tremendous speed , so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details ; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars , whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party .
the ghouls had likewise glimpsed it , for he heard their low glibbering all about him , and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak , of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen .
soon , however , he saw that this theory would not hold ; for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird .
its outline against the stars , necessarily vague as it was , resembled rather some huge mitred head , or pair of heads infinitely magnified ; and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one .
carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on , but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen , since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleft .
then came a wide gap in the range , where the hideous reaches of transmontane leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass trough which the stars shone wanly .
carter watched this gap with intense care , knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles .
the object had now floated ahead a trifle , and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in silhouette .
gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap , slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army .
for another minute suspense was keen , and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came ; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and meep of cosmic fear , and to the soul of the traveller a chill that never wholly left it .
for the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a head a mitred double head and below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it ; the mountain high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence ; the distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky , its repulsive pair of heads reaching half way to the zenith .
carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud , for he was an old dreamer ; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks , bobbing along stealthily after the first one .
and straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars , tiptoeing wolflike and lumberingly , their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the aft .
the carven mountains , then , had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of inquanok , with right hands uplifted .
they had duties to perform , and were not remiss .
but it was horrible that they never spoke , and never even made a sound in walking .
meanwhile the ghoul that was pickman had glibbered an order to the , and the whole army soared higher into the air .
up toward the stars the grotesque column shot , till nothing stood out any longer against the sky ; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven mitred mountains that walked .
all was blackness beneath as the fluttering legion surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether , and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them .
the farther they went , the faster they flew , till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit .
carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them , but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties .
that they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain , and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasized their northward focus ; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole , as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein .
then he noticed with terror that the wings of the were not flapping any more .
the horned and faceless steeds had folded their membranous appendages , and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on .
a force not of earth had seized on the army , and ghouls and alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned .
at length a lone pallid light was seen on the skyline ahead , thereafter rising steadily as they approached , and having beneath it a black mass that blotted out the stars .
carter saw that it must be some beacon on a mountain , for only a mountain could rise so vast as seen from so prodigious a height in the air .
higher and higher rose the light and the blackness beneath it , till all the northern sky was obscured by the rugged conical mass .
lofty as the army was , that pale and sinister beacon rose above it , towering monstrous over all peaks and concernments of earth , and tasting the atomless aether where the cryptical moon and the mad planets reel .
no mountain known of man was that which loomed before them .
the high clouds far below were but a fringe for its foothills .
the groping dizziness of topmost air was but a girdle for its loins .
scornful and spectral climbed that bridge betwixt earth and heaven , black in eternal night , and crowned with a pshent of unknown stars whose awful and significant outline grew every moment clearer .
ghouls meeped in wonder as they saw it , and carter shivered in fear lest all the hurtling army be dashed to pieces on the unyielding onyx of that cyclopean cliff .
higher and higher rose the light , till it mingled with the loftiest orbs of the zenith and winked down at the flyers with lurid mockery .
all the north beneath it was blackness now ; dread , stony blackness from infinite depths to infinite heights , with only that pale winking beacon perched unreachably at the top of all vision .
carter studied the light more closely , and saw at last what lines its inky background made against the stars .
there were towers on that titan mountaintop ; horrible domed towers in noxious and incalculable tiers and clusters beyond any dreamable workmanship of man ; battlements and terraces of wonder and menace , all limned tiny and black and distant against the starry pshent that glowed malevolently at the uppermost rim of sight .
capping that most measureless of mountains was a castle beyond all mortal thought , and in it glowed the .
then randolph carter knew that his quest was done , and that he saw above him the goal of all forbidden steps and audacious visions ; the fabulous , the incredible home of the great ones atop unknown kadath .
even as he realised this thing , carter noticed a change in the course of the helplessly party .
they were rising abruptly now , and it was plain that the focus of their flight was the onyx castle where the pale light shone .
so close was the great black mountain that its sides sped by them dizzily as they shot upward , and in the darkness they could discern nothing upon it .
vaster and vaster loomed the tenebrous towers of the nighted castle above , and carter could see that it was blasphemous in its immensity .
well might its stones have been quarried by nameless workmen in that horrible gulf rent out of the rock in the hill pass north of inquanok , for such was its size that a man on its threshold stood even as air out on the steps of earth loftiest fortress .
the pshent of unknown stars above the myriad domed turrets glowed with a sallow , sickly flare , so that a kind of twilight hung about the murky walls of slippery onyx .
the pallid beacon was now seen to be a single shining window high up in one of the loftiest towers , and as the helpless army neared the top of the mountain carter thought he detected unpleasant shadows flitting across the feebly luminous expanse .
it was a strangely arched window , of a design wholly alien to earth .
the solid rock now gave place to the giant foundations of the monstrous castle , and it seemed that the speed of the party was somewhat abated .
vast walls shot up , and there was a glimpse of a great gate through which the voyagers were swept .
all was night in the titan courtyard , and then came the deeper blackness of inmost things as a huge arched portal engulfed the column .
vortices of cold wind surged dankly through sightless labyrinths of onyx , and carter could never tell what cyclopean stairs and corridors lay silent along the route of his endless aerial twisting .
always upward led the terrible plunge in darkness , and never a sound , touch or glimpse broke the dense pall of mystery .
large as the army of ghouls and was , it was lost in the prodigious voids of that more than earthly castle .
and when at last there suddenly dawned around him the lurid light of that single tower room whose lofty window had served as a beacon , it took carter long to discern the far walls and high , distant ceiling , and to realize that he was indeed not again in the boundless air outside .
randolph carter had hoped to come into the of the great ones with poise and dignity , flanked and followed by impressive lines of ghouls in ceremonial order , and offering his prayer as a free and potent master among dreamers .
he had known that the great ones themselves are not beyond a mortal power to cope with , and had trusted to luck that the other gods and their crawling chaos nyarlathotep would not happen to come to their aid at the crucial moment , as they had so often done before when men sought out earth gods in their home or on their mountains .
and with his hideous escort he had half hoped to defy even the other gods if need were , knowing as he did that ghouls have no masters , and that own not nyarlathotep but only archaic nodens for their lord .
but now he saw that supernal kadath in its cold waste is indeed girt with dark wonders and nameless sentinels , and that the other gods are of a surety vigilant in guarding the mild , feeble gods of earth .
void as they are of lordship over ghouls and , the mindless , shapeless blasphemies of outer space can yet control them when they must ; so that it was not in state as a free and potent master of dreamers that randolph carter came into the great ones ' with his ghouls .
swept and herded by nightmare tempests from the stars , and dogged by unseen horrors of the northern waste , all that army floated captive and helpless in the lurid light , dropping numbly to the onyx floor when by some voiceless order the winds of fright dissolved .
before no golden dais had randolph carter come , nor was there any august circle of crowned and haloed beings with narrow eyes , ears , thin nose , and pointed chin whose kinship to the carven face on ngranek might stamp them as those to whom a dreamer might pray .
save for the one tower room the onyx castle atop kadath was dark , and the masters were not there .
carter had come to unknown kadath in the cold waste , but he had not found the gods .
yet still the lurid light glowed in that one tower room whose size was so little less than that of all outdoors , and whose distant walls and roof were so nearly lost to sight in thin , curling mists .
earth gods were not there , it was true , but of subtler and less visible presences there could be no lack .
where the mild gods are absent , the other gods are not unrepresented ; and certainly , the onyx castle of castles was far from tenantless .
in what outrageous form or forms terror would next reveal itself carter could by no means imagine .
he felt that his visit had been expected , and wondered how close a watch had all along been kept upon him by the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
it is nyarlathotep , horror of infinite shapes and dread soul and messenger of the other gods , that the fungous moonbeasts serve ; and carter thought of the black galley that had vanished when the tide of battle turned against the toadlike abnormalities on the jagged rock in the sea .
reflecting upon these things , he was staggering to his feet in the midst of his nightmare company when there rang without warning through that and limitless chamber the hideous blast of a daemon trumpet .
three times pealed that frightful brazen scream , and when the echoes of the third blast had died chucklingly away randolph carter saw that he was alone .
whither , why and how the ghouls and night gaunts had been snatched from sight was not for him to divine .
he knew only that he was suddenly alone , and that whatever unseen powers lurked mockingly around him were no powers of earth friendly dreamland .
presently from the chamber uttermost reaches a new sound came .
this , too , was a rhythmic trumpeting ; but of a kind far removed from the three raucous blasts which had dissolved his goodly cohorts .
in this low fanfare echoed all the wonder and melody of ethereal dream ; exotic vistas of unimagined loveliness floating from each strange chord and subtly alien cadence .
odours of incense came to match the golden notes ; and overhead a great light dawned , its colours changing in cycles unknown to earth spectrum , and following the song of the trumpets in weird symphonic harmonies .
torches flared in the distance , and the beat of drums throbbed nearer amidst waves of tense expectancy .
out of the thinning mists and the cloud of strange incenses filed twin columns of giant black slaves with of iridescent silk .
upon their heads were strapped vast torches of glittering metal , from which the fragrance of obscure balsams spread in fumous spirals .
in their right hands were crystal wands whose tips were carven into leering chimaeras , while their left hands grasped long thin silver trumpets which they blew in turn .
armlets and anklets of gold they had , and between each pair of anklets stretched a golden chain that held its wearer to a sober gait .
that they were true black men of earth dreamland was at once apparent , but it seemed less likely that their rites and costumes were wholly things of our earth .
ten feet from carter the columns stopped , and as they did so each trumpet flew abruptly to its bearer thick lips .
wild and ecstatic was the blast that followed , and wilder still the cry that chorused just after from dark throats somehow made shrill by strange artifice .
then down the wide lane betwixt the two columns a lone figure strode ; a tall , slim figure with the young face of an antique pharaoh , gay with prismatic robes and crowned with a golden pshent that glowed with inherent light .
close up to carter strode that regal figure ; whose proud carriage and smart features had in them the fascination of a dark god or fallen archangel , and around whose eyes there lurked the languid sparkle of capricious humour .
it spoke , and in its mellow tones there rippled the wild music of lethean streams .
randolph carter , said the voice , you have come to see the great ones whom it is unlawful for men to see .
watchers have spoken of this thing , and the other gods have grunted as they rolled and tumbled mindlessly to the sound of thin flutes in the black ultimate void where broods the whose name no lips dare speak aloud .
when barzai the wise climbed to see the greater ones dance and howl above the clouds in the moonlight he never returned .
the other gods were there , and they did what was expected .
zenig of aphorat sought to reach unknown kadath in the cold waste , and his skull is now set in a ring on the little finger of one whom i need not name .
but you , randolph carter , have braved all things of earth dreamland , and burn still with the flame of quest .
you came not as one curious , but as one seeking his due , nor have you failed ever in reverence toward the mild gods of earth .
yet have these gods kept you from the marvellous sunset city of your dreams , and wholly through their own small covetousness ; for verily , they craved the weird loveliness of that which your fancy had fashioned , and vowed that henceforward no other spot should be their abode .
they are gone from their castle on unknown kadath to dwell in your marvellous city .
all through its palaces of veined marble they revel by day , and when the sun sets they go out in the perfumed gardens and watch the golden glory on temples and colonnades , arched bridges and fountains , and wide streets with urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows .
and when night comes they climb tall terraces in the dew , and sit on carved benches of porphyry scanning the stars , or lean over pale balustrades to gaze at the town steep northward slopes , where one by one the little windows in old peaked gables shine softly out with the calm yellow light of homely candles .
the gods love your marvellous city , and walk no more in the ways of the gods .
they have forgotten the high places of earth , and the mountains that knew their youth .
the earth has no longer any gods that are gods , and only the other ones from outer space hold sway on unremembered kadath .
far away in a valley of your own childhood , randolph carter , play the heedless great ones .
you have dreamed too well , o wise , for you have drawn dream gods away from the world of all men visions to that which is wholly yours ; having builded out of your boyhood small fancies a city more lovely than all the phantoms that have gone before .
it is not well that earth gods leave their thrones for the spider to spin on , and their realm for the others to sway in the dark manner of others .
fain would the powers from outside bring chaos and horror to you , randolph carter , who are the cause of their upsetting , but that they know it is by you alone that the gods may be sent back to their world .
in that dreamland which is yours , no power of uttermost night may pursue ; and only you can send the selfish great ones gently out of your marvellous sunset city , back through the northern twilight to their wonted place atop unknown kadath in the cold waste .
so .
randolph carter , in the name of the other gods i spare you and charge you to seek that sunset city which is yours , and to send thence the drowsy truant gods for whom the dream world waits .
not hard to find is that roseal fever of the gods , that fanfare of supernal trumpets and clash of immortal cymbals , that mystery whose place and meaning have haunted you through the halls of waking and the gulfs of dreaming , and tormented you with hints of vanished memory and the pain of lost things awesome and momentous .
not hard to find is that symbol and relic of your days of wonder , for truly , it is but the stable and eternal gem wherein all that wonder sparkles crystallised to light your evening path .
behold !
it is not over unknown seas but back over years that your quest must go ; back to the bright strange things of infancy and the quick glimpses of magic that old scenes brought to wide young eyes .
for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth .
it is the glory of boston hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset , of the common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the charles flows drowsily .
these things you saw , randolph carter , when your nurse first wheeled you out in the springtime , and they will be the last things you will ever see with eyes of memory and of love .
and there is antique salem with its brooding years , and spectral marblehead scaling its rocky precipices into past centuries !
and the glory of salem towers and spires seen afar from marblehead pastures across the harbour against the setting sun .
there is providence quaint and lordly on its seven hills over the blue harbour , with terraces of green leading up to steeples and citadels of living antiquity , and newport climbing wraithlike from its dreaming breakwater .
arkham is there , with its gambrel roofs and the rocky rolling meadows behind it ; and antediluvian kingsport hoary with stacked chimneys and deserted quays and overhanging gables , and the marvel of high cliffs and the ocean with tolling buoys beyond .
cool vales in concord , cobbled lands in portsmouth , twilight bends of rustic new hampshire roads where giant elms half hide white farmhouse walls and creaking .
gloucester salt wharves and truro windy willows .
vistas of distant steepled towns and hills beyond hills along the north shore , hushed stony slopes and low ivied cottages in the lee of huge boulders in rhode island back country .
scent of the sea and fragrance of the fields ; spell of the dark woods and joy of the orchards and gardens at dawn .
these , randolph carter , are your city ; for they are yourself .
new england bore you , and into your soul she poured a liquid loveliness which can not die .
this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last these endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
look !
through that window shine the stars of eternal night .
even now they are shining above the scenes you have known and cherished , drinking of their charm that they may shine more lovely over the gardens of dream .
there is is winking at this moment over the roofs of tremont street , and you could see him from your window on beacon hill .
out beyond those stars yawn the gulfs from whence my mindless masters have sent me .
some day you too may traverse them , but if you are wise you will beware such folly ; for of those mortals who have been and returned , only one preserves a mind unshattered by the pounding , clawing horrors of the void .
terrors and blasphemies gnaw at one another for space , and there is more evil in the lesser ones than in the greater ; even as you know from the deeds of those who sought to deliver you into my hands , whilst i myself harboured no wish to shatter you , and would indeed have helped you hither long ago had i not been elsewhere busy , and certain that you would yourself find the way .
shun then , the outer hells , and stick to the calm , lovely things of your youth .
seek out your marvellous city and drive thence the recreant great ones , sending them back gently to those scenes which are of their own youth , and which wait uneasy for their return .
easier even then the way of dim memory is the way i will prepare for you .
see !
there comes hither a monstrous shantak , led by a slave who for your peace of mind had best keep invisible .
mount and be ready there !
yogash the black will help you on the scaly horror .
steer for that brightest star just south of the zenith it is vega , and in two hours will be just above the terrace of your sunset city .
steer for it only till you hear a singing in the high aether .
higher than that lurks madness , so rein your shantak when the first note lures .
look then back to earth , and you will see shining the deathless altar flame of from the sacred roof of a temple .
that temple is in your desiderate sunset city , so steer for it before you heed the singing and are lost .
when you draw nigh the city steer for the same high parapet whence of old you scanned the outspread glory , prodding the shantak till he cry aloud .
that cry the great ones will hear and know as they sit on their perfumed terraces , and there will come upon them such a homesickness that all of your city wonders will not console them for the absence of kadath grim castle and the pshent of eternal stars that crowns it .
then must you land amongst them with the shantak , and let them see and touch that noisome and hippocephalic bird ; meanwhile discoursing to them of unknown kadath , which you will so lately have left , and telling them how its boundless halls are lovely and unlighted , where of old they used to leap and revel in supernal radiance .
and the shantak will talk to them in the manner of shantaks , but it will have no powers of persuasion beyond the recalling of elder days .
over and over must you speak to the wandering great ones of their home and youth , till at last they will weep and ask to be shewn the returning path they have forgotten .
thereat can you loose the waiting shantak , sending him skyward with the homing cry of his kind ; hearing which the great ones will prance and jump with antique mirth , and forthwith stride after the loathly bird in the fashion of gods , through the deep gulfs of heaven to kadath familiar towers and domes .
then will the marvellous sunset city be yours to cherish and inhabit for ever , and once more will earth gods rule the dreams of men from their accustomed seat .
go now the casement is open and the stars await outside .
already your shantak wheezes and titters with impatience .
steer for vega through the night , but turn when the singing sounds .
forget not this warning , lest horrors unthinkable suck you into the gulf of shrieking and ululant madness .
remember the other gods ; they are great and mindless and terrible , and lurk in the outer voids .
they are good gods to shun .
hei !
!
you are off !
send back earth gods to their haunts on unknown kadath , and pray to all space that you may never meet me in my thousand other forms .
farewell , randolph carter , and beware ; for i am nyarlathotep , the crawling chaos .
and randolph carter , gasping and dizzy on his hideous shantak , shot screamingly into space toward the cold blue glare of boreal vega ; looking but once behind him at the clustered and chaotic turrets of the onyx nightmare wherein still glowed the lone lurid light of that window above the air and the clouds of earth dreamland .
great polypous horrors slid darkly past , and unseen bat wings beat multitudinous around him , but still he clung to the unwholesome mane of that loathly and hippocephalic scaled bird .
the stars danced mockingly , almost shifting now and then to form pale signs of doom that one might wonder one had not seen and feared before ; and ever the winds of nether howled of vague blackness and loneliness beyond the cosmos .
then through the glittering vault ahead there fell a hush of portent , and all the winds and horrors slunk away as night things slink away before the dawn .
trembling in waves that golden wisps of nebula made weirdly visible , there rose a timid hint of melody , droning in faint chords that our own universe of stars knows not .
and as that music grew , the shantak raised its ears and plunged ahead , and carter likewise bent to catch each lovely strain .
it was a song , but not the song of any voice .
night and the spheres sang it , and it was old when space and nyarlathotep and the other gods were born .
faster flew the shantak , and lower bent the rider , drunk with the marvel of strange gulfs , and whirling in the crystal coils of outer magic .
then came too late the warning of the evil one , the sardonic caution of the daemon legate who had bidden the seeker beware the madness of that song .
only to taunt had nyarlathotep marked out the way to safety and the marvellous sunset city ; only to mock had that black messenger revealed the secret of these truant gods whose steps he could so easily lead back at will .
for madness and the void wild vengeance are nyarlathotep only gifts to the presumptuous ; and frantick though the rider strove to turn his disgusting steed , that leering , tittering shantak coursed on impetuous and relentless , flapping its great slippery wings in malignant joy and headed for those unhallowed pits whither no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of confusion where bubbles and blasphemes at infinity centre the mindless azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud .
unswerving and obedient to the foul legate orders , that hellish bird plunged onward through shoals of shapeless lurkers and caperers in darkness , and vacuous herds of drifting entities that pawed and groped and groped and pawed ; the nameless larvae of the other gods , that are like them blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts onward unswerving and relentless , and tittering hilariously to watch the chuckling and hysterics into which the risen song of night and the spheres had turned , that eldritch scaly monster bore its helpless rider ; hurtling and shooting , cleaving the uttermost rim and spanning the outermost abysses ; leaving behind the stars and the realms of matter , and darting through stark formlessness toward those inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time wherein azathoth gnaws shapeless and ravenous amidst the muffled , maddening beat of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes .
onward onward through the screaming , cackling , and blackly populous gulfs and then from some dim blessed distance there came an image and a thought to randolph carter the doomed .
too well had nyarlathotep planned his mocking and his tantalising , for he had brought up that which no gusts of icy terror could quite efface .
home new england beacon hill the waking world .
for know you , that your gold and marble city of wonder is only the sum of what you have seen and loved in youth the glory of boston hillside roofs and western windows aflame with sunset ; of the flower fragrant common and the great dome on the hill and the tangle of gables and chimneys in the violet valley where the charles flows drowsily this loveliness , moulded , crystallised , and polished by years of memory and dreaming , is your terraced wonder of elusive sunsets ; and to find that marble parapet with curious urns and carven rail , and descend at last those endless balustraded steps to the city of broad squares and prismatic fountains , you need only to turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
onward onward dizzily onward to ultimate doom through the blackness where sightless feelers pawed and slimy snouts jostled and nameless things tittered and tittered and tittered .
but the image and the thought had come , and randolph carter knew clearly that he was dreaming and only dreaming , and that somewhere in the background the world of waking and the city of his infancy still lay .
words came again you need only turn back to the thoughts and visions of your wistful boyhood .
turn turn blackness on every side , but randolph carter could turn .
thick though the rushing nightmare that clutched his senses , randolph carter could turn and move .
he could move , and if he chose he could leap off the evil shantak that bore him hurtlingly doomward at the orders of nyarlathotep .
he could leap off and dare those depths of night that yawned interminably down , those depths of fear whose terrors yet could not exceed the nameless doom that lurked waiting at chaos ' core .
he could turn and move and leap he could he would he would he would .
off that vast hippocephalic abomination leaped the doomed and desperate dreamer , and down through endless voids of sentient blackness he fell .
aeons reeled , universes died and were born again , stars became nebulae and nebulae became stars , and still randolph carter fell through those endless voids of sentient blackness .
then in the slow creeping course of eternity the utmost cycle of the cosmos churned itself into another futile completion , and all things became again as they were unreckoned kalpas before .
matter and light were born anew as space once had known them ; and comets , suns and worlds sprang flaming into life , though nothing survived to tell that they had been and gone , been and gone , always and always , back to no first beginning .
and there was a firmament again , and a wind , and a glare of purple light in the eyes of the falling dreamer .
there were gods and presences and wills ; beauty and evil , and the shrieking of noxious night robbed of its prey .
for through the unknown ultimate cycle had lived a thought and a vision of a dreamer boyhood , and now there were remade a waking world and an old cherished city to body and to justify these things .
out of the void the violet gas had pointed the way , and archaic nodens was bellowing his guidance from unhinted deeps .
stars swelled to dawns , and dawns burst into fountains of gold , carmine , and purple , and still the dreamer fell .
cries rent the aether as ribbons of light beat back the fiends from outside .
and hoary nodens raised a howl of triumph when nyarlathotep , close on his quarry , stopped baffled by a glare that seared his formless to grey dust .
randolph carter had indeed descended at last the wide marmoreal flights to his marvellous city , for he was come again to the fair new england world that had wrought him .
so to the organ chords of morning myriad whistles , and dawn blaze thrown dazzling through purple panes by the great gold dome of the state house on the hill , randolph carter leaped shoutingly awake within his boston room .
birds sang in hidden gardens and the perfume of trellised vines came wistful from arbours his grandfather had reared .
beauty and light glowed from classic mantel and carven cornice and walls grotesquely figured , while a sleek black cat rose yawning from hearthside sleep that his master start and shriek had disturbed .
and vast infinities away , past the gate of deeper slumber and the enchanted wood and the garden lands and the cerenarian sea and the twilight reaches of inquanok , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep strode brooding into the onyx castle atop unknown kadath in the cold waste , and taunted insolently the mild gods of earth whom he had snatched abruptly from their scented revels in the marvellous sunset city .
yes , he lived here but i do advise your doing anything .
your curiosity makes you irresponsible .
we never come here at night , and it only because of his will that we keep it this way .
you know what he did .
that abominable society took charge at last , and we do know where he is buried .
there was no way the law or anything else could reach the society .
i hope you wo stay till after dark .
and i beg of you to let that thing on the table the thing that looks like a alone .
we do know what it is , but we suspect it has something to do with what he did .
we even avoid looking at it very steadily .
after a time the man left me alone in the attic room .
it was very dingy and dusty , and only primitively furnished , but it had a neatness which showed it was not a quarters .
there were shelves full of theological and classical books , and another bookcase containing treatises on magic paracelsus , albertus magnus , trithemius , hermes trismegistus , borellus , and others in a strange alphabet whose titles i could not decipher .
the furniture was very plain .
there was a door , but it led only into a closet .
the only egress was the aperture in the floor up to which the crude , steep staircase led .
the windows were of pattern , and the black oak beams bespoke unbelievable antiquity .
plainly , this house was of the old world .
i seemed to know where i was , but can not recall what i then knew .
certainly the town was not london .
my impression is of a small seaport .
the small object on the table fascinated me intensely .
i seemed to know what to do with it , for i drew a pocket electric light or what looked like one out of my pocket and nervously tested its flashes .
the light was not white but violet , and seemed less like true light than like some radioactive bombardment .
i recall that i did not regard it as a common flashlight indeed , i had a common flashlight in another pocket .
it was getting dark , and the ancient roofs and outside looked very queer through the .
finally i summoned up courage and propped the small object up on the table against a book then turned the rays of the peculiar violet light upon it .
the light seemed now to be more like a rain of hail or small violet particles than like a continuous beam .
as the particles struck the glassy surface at the center of the strange device , they seemed to produce a crackling noise like the sputtering of a vacuum tube through which sparks are passed .
the dark glassy surface displayed a pinkish glow , and a vague white shape seemed to be taking form at its center .
then i noticed that i was not alone in the room and put the ray projector back in my pocket .
but the newcomer did not speak nor did i hear any sound whatever during all the immediately following moments .
everything was shadowy pantomime , as if seen at a vast distance through some intervening haze although on the other hand the newcomer and all subsequent comers loomed large and close , as if both near and distant , according to some abnormal geometry .
the newcomer was a thin , dark man of medium height attired in the clerical garb of the anglican church .
he was apparently about thirty years old , with a sallow , olive complexion and fairly good features , but an abnormally high forehead .
his black hair was well cut and neatly brushed , and he was though with a heavy growth of beard .
he wore rimless spectacles with steel bows .
his build and lower facial features were like other clergymen i had seen , but he had a vastly higher forehead , and was darker and more also more subtly and concealedly .
at the present moment having just lighted a faint oil lamp he looked nervous , and before i knew it he was casting all his magical books into a fireplace on the window side of the room ( where the wall slanted sharply ) which i had not noticed before .
the flames devoured the volumes greedily leaping up in strange colors and emitting indescribably hideous odors as the strangely hieroglyphed leaves and wormy bindings succumbed to the devastating element .
all at once i saw there were others in the room men in clerical costume , one of whom wore the bands and of a bishop .
though i could hear nothing , i could see that they were bringing a decision of vast import to the .
they seemed to hate and fear him at the same time , and he seemed to return these sentiments .
his face set itself into a grim expression , but i could see his right hand shaking as he tried to grip the back of a chair .
the bishop pointed to the empty case and to the fireplace ( where the flames had died down amidst a charred , mass ) , and seemed filled with a peculiar loathing .
the then gave a wry smile and reached out with his left hand toward the small object on the table .
everyone then seemed frightened .
the procession of clerics began filing down the steep stairs through the trapdoor in the floor , turning and making menacing gestures as they left .
the bishop was last to go .
the now went to a cupboard on the inner side of the room and extracted a coil of rope .
mounting a chair , he attached one end of the rope to a hook in the great exposed central beam of black oak , and began making a noose with the other end .
realizing he was about to hang himself , i started forward to dissuade or save him .
he saw me and ceased his preparations , looking at me with a kind of triumph which puzzled and disturbed me .
he slowly stepped down from the chair and began gliding toward me with a positively wolfish grin on his dark , face .
i felt somehow in deadly peril , and drew out the peculiar as a weapon of defense .
why i thought it could help me , i do not know .
i turned it on full in his face , and saw the sallow features glow first with violet and then with pinkish light .
his expression of wolfish exultation began to be crowded aside by a look of profound fear which did not , however , wholly displace the exultation .
he stopped in his tracks then , flailing his arms wildly in the air , began to stagger backwards .
i saw he was edging toward the open in the floor , and tried to shout a warning , but he did not hear me .
in another instant he had lurched backward through the opening and was lost to view .
i found difficulty in moving toward the , but when i did get there i found no crushed body on the floor below .
instead there was a clatter of people coming up with lanterns , for the spell of phantasmal silence had broken , and i once more heard sounds and saw figures as normally .
something had evidently drawn a crowd to this place .
had there been a noise i had not heard ?
