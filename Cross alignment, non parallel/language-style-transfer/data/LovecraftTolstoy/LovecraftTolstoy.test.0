what would the storm call forth or was there anything left for it to call ?
guided by a lightning flash i settled myself down behind a dense clump of vegetation , through which i could see the opening without being seen .
if heaven is merciful , it will some day efface from my consciousness the sight that i saw , and let me live my last years in peace .
i can not sleep at night now , and have to take opiates when it thunders .
the thing came abruptly and unannounced ; a demon , ratlike scurrying from pits remote and unimaginable , a hellish panting and stifled grunting , and then from that opening beneath the chimney a burst of multitudinous and leprous life a loathsome flood of organic corruption more devastatingly hideous than the blackest conjurations of mortal madness and morbidity .
seething , stewing , surging , bubbling like serpents ' slime it rolled up and out of that yawning hole , spreading like a septic contagion and streaming from the cellar at every point of egress streaming out to scatter through the accursed midnight forests and strew fear , madness , and death .
god knows how many there were there must have been thousands .
to see the stream of them in that faint intermittent lightning was shocking .
when they had thinned out enough to be glimpsed as separate organisms , i saw that they were dwarfed , deformed hairy devils or apes monstrous and diabolic caricatures of the monkey tribe .
they were so hideously silent ; there was hardly a squeal when one of the last stragglers turned with the skill of long practice to make a meal in accustomed fashion on a weaker companion .
others snapped up what it left and ate with slavering relish .
then , in spite of my daze of fright and disgust , my morbid curiosity triumphed ; and as the last of the monstrosities oozed up alone from that nether world of unknown nightmare , i drew my automatic pistol and shot it under cover of the thunder .
shrieking , slithering , torrential shadows of red viscous madness chasing one another through endless , ensanguined corridors of purple fulgurous sky formless phantasms and kaleidoscopic mutations of a ghoulish , remembered scene ; forests of monstrous oaks with serpent roots twisting and sucking unnamable juices from an earth verminous with millions of cannibal devils ; tentacles groping from underground nuclei of polypous perversion insane lightning over malignant ivied walls and demon arcades choked with fungous vegetation heaven be thanked for the instinct which led me unconscious to places where men dwell ; to the peaceful village that slept under the calm stars of clearing skies .
i had recovered enough in a week to send to albany for a gang of men to blow up the martense mansion and the entire top of tempest mountain with dynamite , stop up all the discoverable , and destroy certain trees whose very existence seemed an insult to sanity .
i could sleep a little after they had done this , but true rest will never come as long as i remember that nameless secret of the lurking fear .
the thing will haunt me , for who can say the extermination is complete , and that analogous phenomena do not exist all over the world ?
who can , with my knowledge , think of the earth unknown caverns without a nightmare dread of future possibilities ?
i can not see a well or a subway entrance without shuddering why can not the doctors give me something to make me sleep , or truly calm my brain when it thunders ?
what i saw in the glow of flashlight after i shot the unspeakable straggling object was so simple that almost a minute elapsed before i understood and went delirious .
the object was nauseous ; a filthy whitish gorilla thing with sharp yellow fangs and matted fur .
it was the ultimate product of mammalian degeneration ; the frightful outcome of isolated spawning , multiplication , and cannibal nutrition above and below the ground ; the embodiment of all the snarling and chaos and grinning fear that lurk behind life .
it had looked at me as it died , and its eyes had the same odd quality that marked those other eyes which had stared at me underground and excited cloudy recollections .
one eye was blue , the other brown .
they were the dissimilar martense eyes of the old legends , and i knew in one inundating cataclysm of voiceless horror what had become of that vanished family ; the terrible and house of martense .
somewhere , to what remote and fearsome region i know not , denys barry has gone .
i was with him the last night he lived among men , and heard his screams when the thing came to him ; but all the peasants and police in county meath could never find him , or the others , though they searched long and far .
and now i shudder when i hear the frogs piping in swamps , or see the moon in lonely places .
i had known denys barry well in america , where he had grown rich , and had congratulated him when he bought back the old castle by the bog at sleepy kilderry .
it was from kilderry that his father had come , and it was there that he wished to enjoy his wealth among ancestral scenes .
men of his blood had once ruled over kilderry and built and dwelt in the castle , but those days were very remote , so that for generations the castle had been empty and decaying .
after he went to ireland , barry wrote me often , and told me how under his care the gray castle was rising tower by tower to its ancient splendor , how the ivy was climbing slowly over the restored walls as it had climbed so many centuries ago , and how the peasants blessed him for bringing back the old days with his gold from over the sea .
but in time there came troubles , and the peasants ceased to bless him , and fled away instead as from a doom .
and then he sent a letter and asked me to visit him , for he was lonely in the castle with no one to speak to save the new servants and laborers he had brought from the north .
the bog was the cause of all these troubles , as barry told me the night i came to the castle .
i had reached kilderry in the summer sunset , as the gold of the sky lighted the green of the hills and groves and the blue of the bog , where on a far islet a strange olden ruin glistened spectrally .
that sunset was very beautiful , but the peasants at ballylough had warned me against it and said that kilderry had become accursed , so that i almost shuddered to see the high turrets of the castle gilded with fire .
barry motor had met me at the ballylough station , for kilderry is off the railway .
the villagers had shunned the car and the driver from the north , but had whispered to me with pale faces when they saw i was going to kilderry .
and that night , after our reunion , barry told me why .
the peasants had gone from kilderry because denys barry was to drain the great bog .
for all his love of ireland , america had not left him untouched , and he hated the beautiful wasted space where peat might be cut and land opened up .
the legends and superstitions of kilderry did not move him , and he laughed when the peasants first refused to help , and then cursed him and went away to ballylough with their few belongings as they saw his determination .
in their place he sent for laborers from the north , and when the servants left he replaced them likewise .
but it was lonely among strangers , so barry had asked me to come .
when i heard the fears which had driven the people from kilderry , i laughed as loudly as my friend had laughed , for these fears were of the vaguest , wildest , and most absurd character .
they had to do with some preposterous legend of the bog , and a grim guardian spirit that dwelt in the strange olden ruin on the far islet i had seen in the sunset .
there were tales of dancing lights in the dark of the moon , and of chill winds when the night was warm ; of wraiths in white hovering over the waters , and of an imagined city of stone deep down below the swampy surface .
but foremost among the weird fancies , and alone in its absolute unanimity , was that of the curse awaiting him who should dare to touch or drain the vast reddish morass .
there were secrets , said the peasants , which must not be uncovered ; secrets that had lain hidden since the plague came to the children of partholan in the fabulous years beyond history .
in the book of invaders it is told that these sons of the greeks were all buried at tallaght , but old men in kilderry said that one city was overlooked save by its patron moon goddess ; so that only the wooded hills buried it when the men of nemed swept down from scythia in their thirty ships .
such were the idle tales which had made the villagers leave kilderry , and when i heard them i did not wonder that denys barry had refused to listen .
he had , however , a great interest in antiquities , and proposed to explore the bog thoroughly when it was drained .
the white ruins on the islet he had often visited , but though their age was plainly great , and their contour very little like that of most ruins in ireland , they were too dilapidated to tell the days of their glory .
now the work of drainage was ready to begin , and the laborers from the north were soon to strip the forbidden bog of its green moss and red heather , and kill the tiny streamlets and quiet blue pools fringed with rushes .
after barry had told me these things i was very drowsy , for the travels of the day had been wearying and my host had talked late into the night .
a showed me to my room , which was in a remote tower overlooking the village and the plain at the edge of the bog , and the bog itself ; so that i could see from my windows in the moonlight the silent roofs from which the peasants had fled and which now sheltered the laborers from the north , and too , the parish church with its antique spire , and far out across the brooding bog the remote olden ruin on the islet gleaming white and spectral .
just as i dropped to sleep i fancied i heard faint sounds from the distance ; sounds that were wild and half musical , and stirred me with a weird excitement which colored my dreams .
but when i awaked next morning i felt it had all been a dream , for the visions i had seen were more wonderful than any sound of wild pipes in the night .
influenced by the legends that barry had related , my mind had in slumber hovered around a stately city in a green valley , where marble streets and statues , villas and temples , carvings and inscriptions , all spoke in certain tones the glory that was greece .
when i told this dream to barry we had both laughed ; but i laughed the louder , because he was perplexed about his laborers from the north .
for the sixth time they had all overslept , waking very slowly and dazedly , and acting as if they had not rested , although they were known to have gone early to bed the night before .
that morning and afternoon i wandered alone through the village and talked now and then with idle laborers , for barry was busy with the final plans for beginning his work of drainage .
the laborers were not as happy as they might have been , for most of them seemed uneasy over some dream which they had had , yet which they tried in vain to remember .
i told them of my dream , but they were not interested till i spoke of the weird sounds i thought i had heard .
then they looked oddly at me , and said that they seemed to remember weird sounds , too .
in the evening barry dined with me and announced that he would begin the drainage in two days .
i was glad , for although i disliked to see the moss and the heather and the little streams and lakes depart , i had a growing wish to discern the ancient secrets the peat might hide .
and that night my dreams of piping flutes and marble peristyles came to a sudden and disquieting end ; for upon the city in the valley i saw a pestilence descend , and then a frightful avalanche of wooded slopes that covered the dead bodies in the streets and left unburied only the temple of artemis on the high peak , where the aged cleis lay cold and silent with a crown of ivory on her silver head .
i have said that i awaked suddenly and in alarm .
for some time i could not tell whether i was waking or sleeping , for the sound of flutes still rang shrilly in my ears ; but when i saw on the floor the icy moonbeams and the outlines of a latticed gothic window , i decided i must be awake and in the castle of kilderry .
then i heard a clock from some remote landing below strike the hour of two , and knew i was awake .
yet still there came that monstrous piping from afar ; wild , weird airs that made me think of some dance of fauns on distant maenalus .
it would not let me sleep , and in impatience i sprang up and paced the floor .
only by chance did i go to the north window and look out upon the silent village and the plain at the edge of the bog .
i had no wish to gaze abroad , for i wanted to sleep ; but the flutes tormented me , and i had to do or see something .
how could i have suspected the thing i was to behold ?
there in the moonlight that flooded the spacious plain was a spectacle which no mortal , having seen it , could ever forget .
to the sound of reedy pipes that echoed over the bog there glided silently and eerily a mixed throng of swaying figures , reeling through such a revel as the sicilians may have danced to demeter in the old days under the harvest moon beside the cyane .
the wide plain , the golden moonlight , the shadowy moving forms , and above all the shrill monotonous piping , produced an effect which almost paralyzed me ; yet i noted amidst my fear that half of these tireless mechanical dancers were the laborers whom i had thought asleep , whilst the other half were strange airy beings in white , in nature , but suggesting pale wistful naiads from the haunted fountains of the bog .
i do not know how long i gazed at this sight from the lonely turret window before i dropped suddenly in a dreamless swoon , out of which the high sun of morning aroused me .
my first impulse on awaking was to communicate all my fears and observations to denys barry , but as i saw the sunlight glowing through the latticed east window i became sure that there was no reality in what i thought i had seen .
i am given to strange fantasms , yet am never weak enough to believe in them ; so on this occasion contented myself with questioning the laborers , who slept very late and recalled nothing of the previous night save misty dreams of shrill sounds .
this matter of the spectral piping harassed me greatly , and i wondered if the crickets of autumn had come before their time to vex the night and haunt the visions of men .
later in the day i watched barry in the library poring over his plans for the great work which was to begin on the morrow , and for the first time felt a touch of the same kind of fear that had driven the peasants away .
for some unknown reason i dreaded the thought of disturbing the ancient bog and its sunless secrets , and pictured terrible sights lying black under the unmeasured depth of peat .
that these secrets should be brought to light seemed injudicious , and i began to wish for an excuse to leave the castle and the village .
i went so far as to talk casually to barry on the subject , but did not dare continue after he gave his resounding laugh .
so i was silent when the sun set fulgently over the far hills , and kilderry blazed all red and gold in a flame that seemed a portent .
whether the events of that night were of reality or illusion i shall never ascertain .
certainly they transcend anything we dream of in nature and the universe ; yet in no normal fashion can i explain those disappearances which were known to all men after it was over .
i retired early and full of dread , and for a long time could not sleep in the uncanny silence of the tower .
it was very dark , for although the sky was clear the moon was now well in the wane , and would not rise till the small hours .
i thought as i lay there of denys barry , and of what would befall that bog when the day came , and found myself almost frantic with an impulse to rush out into the night , take barry car , and drive madly to ballylough out of the menaced lands .
but before my fears could crystallize into action i had fallen asleep , and gazed in dreams upon the city in the valley , cold and dead under a shroud of hideous shadow .
probably it was the shrill piping that awaked me , yet that piping was not what i noticed first when i opened my eyes .
i was lying with my back to the east window overlooking the bog , where the waning moon would rise , and therefore expected to see light cast on the opposite wall before me ; but i had not looked for such a sight as now appeared .
light indeed glowed on the panels ahead , but it was not any light that the moon gives .
terrible and piercing was the shaft of ruddy refulgence that streamed through the gothic window , and the whole chamber was brilliant with a splendor intense and unearthly .
my immediate actions were peculiar for such a situation , but it is only in tales that a man does the dramatic and foreseen thing .
instead of looking out across the bog toward the source of the new light , i kept my eyes from the window in panic fear , and clumsily drew on my clothing with some dazed idea of escape .
i remember seizing my revolver and hat , but before it was over i had lost them both without firing the one or donning the other .
after a time the fascination of the red radiance overcame my fright , and i crept to the east window and looked out whilst the maddening , incessant piping whined and reverberated through the castle and over all the village .
over the bog was a deluge of flaring light , scarlet and sinister , and pouring from the strange olden ruin on the far islet .
the aspect of that ruin i can not describe i must have been mad , for it seemed to rise majestic and undecayed , splendid and , the flame reflecting marble of its entablature piercing the sky like the apex of a temple on a .
flutes shrieked and drums began to beat , and as i watched in awe and terror i thought i saw dark saltant forms silhouetted grotesquely against the vision of marble and effulgence .
the effect was titanic altogether unthinkable and i might have stared indefinitely had not the sound of the piping seemed to grow stronger at my left .
trembling with a terror oddly mixed with ecstasy , i crossed the circular room to the north window from which i could see the village and the plain at the edge of the bog .
there my eyes dilated again with a wild wonder as great as if i had not just turned from a scene beyond the pale of nature , for on the ghastly plain was moving a procession of beings in such a manner as none ever saw before save in nightmares .
half gliding , half floating in the air , the were slowly retreating toward the still waters and the island ruin in fantastic formations suggesting some ancient and solemn ceremonial dance .
their waving translucent arms , guided by the detestable piping of those unseen flutes , beckoned in uncanny rhythm to a throng of lurching laborers who followed doglike with blind , brainless , floundering steps as if dragged by a clumsy but resistless .
as the naiads neared the bog , without altering their course , a new line of stumbling stragglers zigzagged drunkenly out of the castle from some door far below my window , groped sightlessly across the courtyard and through the intervening bit of village , and joined the floundering column of laborers on the plain .
despite their distance below me i at once knew they were the servants brought from the north , for i recognized the ugly and unwieldy form of the cook , whose very absurdness had now become unutterably tragic .
the flutes piped horribly , and again i heard the beating of the drums from the direction of the island ruin .
then silently and gracefully the naiads reached the water and melted one by one into the ancient bog ; while the line of followers , never checking their speed , splashed awkwardly after them and vanished amidst a tiny vortex of unwholesome bubbles which i could barely see in the scarlet light .
and as the last pathetic straggler , the fat cook , sank heavily out of sight in that sullen pool , the flutes and the drums grew silent , and the blinding red rays from the ruins snapped instantaneously out , leaving the village of doom lone and desolate in the wan beams of a moon .
my condition was now one of indescribable chaos .
not knowing whether i was mad or sane , sleeping or waking , i was saved only by a merciful numbness .
i believe i did ridiculous things such as offering prayers to artemis , latona , demeter , persephone , and plouton .
all that i recalled of a classic youth came to my lips as the horrors of the situation roused my deepest superstitions .
i felt that i had witnessed the death of a whole village , and knew i was alone in the castle with denys barry , whose boldness had brought down a doom .
as i thought of him , new terrors convulsed me , and i fell to the floor ; not fainting , but physically helpless .
then i felt the icy blast from the east window where the moon had risen , and began to hear the shrieks in the castle far below me .
soon those shrieks had attained a magnitude and quality which can not be written of , and which makes me faint as i think of them .
all i can say is that they came from something i had known as a friend .
at some time during this shocking period the cold wind and the screaming must have roused me , for my next impression is of racing madly through inky rooms and corridors and out across the courtyard into the hideous night .
they found me at dawn wandering mindless near ballylough , but what unhinged me utterly was not any of the horrors i had seen or heard before .
what i muttered about as i came slowly out of the shadows was a pair of fantastic incidents which occurred in my flight incidents of no significance , yet which haunt me unceasingly when i am alone in certain marshy places or in the moonlight .
as i fled from that accursed castle along the bog edge i heard a new sound common , yet unlike any i had heard before at kilderry .
the stagnant waters , lately quite devoid of animal life , now teemed with a horde of slimy enormous frogs which piped shrilly and incessantly in tones strangely out of keeping with their size .
they glistened bloated and green in the moonbeams , and seemed to gaze up at the fount of light .
i followed the gaze of one very fat and ugly frog , and saw the second of the things which drove my senses away .
stretching directly from the strange olden ruin on the far islet to the waning moon , my eyes seemed to trace a beam of faint quivering radiance having no reflection in the waters of the bog .
and upward along that pallid path my fevered fancy pictured a thin shadow slowly writhing ; a vague contorted shadow struggling as if drawn by unseen demons .
crazed as i was , i saw in that awful shadow a monstrous resemblance a nauseous , unbelievable caricature a blasphemous effigy of him who had been denys barry .
i have examined maps of the city with the greatest care , yet have never again found the rue .
these maps have not been modern maps alone , for i know that names change .
i have , on the contrary , delved deeply into all the antiquities of the place , and have personally explored every region , of whatever name , which could possibly answer to the street i knew as the rue .
but despite all i have done , it remains an humiliating fact that i can not find the house , the street , or even the locality , where , during the last months of my impoverished life as a student of metaphysics at the university , i heard the music of erich zann .
that my memory is broken , i do not wonder ; for my health , physical and mental , was gravely disturbed throughout the period of my residence in the rue , and i recall that i took none of my few acquaintances there .
but that i can not find the place again is both singular and perplexing ; for it was within a walk of the university and was distinguished by peculiarities which could hardly be forgotten by any one who had been there .
i have never met a person who has seen the rue .
the rue lay across a dark river bordered by precipitous brick warehouses and spanned by a ponderous bridge of dark stone .
it was always shadowy along that river , as if the smoke of neighboring factories shut out the sun perpetually .
the river was also odorous with evil stenches which i have never smelled elsewhere , and which may some day help me to find it , since i should recognize them at once .
beyond the bridge were narrow cobbled streets with rails ; and then came the ascent , at first gradual , but incredibly steep as the rue was reached .
i have never seen another street as narrow and steep as the rue .
it was almost a cliff , closed to all vehicles , consisting in several places of flights of steps , and ending at the top in a lofty ivied wall .
its paving was irregular , sometimes stone slabs , sometimes cobblestones , and sometimes bare earth with struggling vegetation .
the houses were tall , , incredibly old , and crazily leaning backward , forward , and sidewise .
occasionally an opposite pair , both leaning forward , almost met across the street like an arch ; and certainly they kept most of the light from the ground below .
there were a few overhead bridges from house to house across the street .
the inhabitants of that street impressed me peculiarly ; at first i thought it was because they were all silent and reticent ; but later decided it was because they were all very old .
i do not know how i came to live on such a street , but i was not myself when i moved there .
i had been living in many poor places , always evicted for want of money ; until at last i came upon that tottering house in the rue kept by the paralytic blandot .
it was the third house from the top of the street , and by far the tallest of them all .
my room was on the fifth story ; the only inhabited room there , since the house was almost empty .
on the night i arrived i heard strang music from the peaked garret overhead , and the next day asked old blandot about it .
he told me it was an old german , a strange dumb man who signed his name as erich zann , and who played evenings in a cheap theater orchestra ; adding that zann desire to play in the night after his return from the theater was the reason he had chosen this lofty and isolated garret room , whose single gable window was the only point on the street from which one could look over the terminating wall at the declivity and panorama beyond .
thereafter i heard zann every night , and although he kept me awake , i was haunted by the weirdness of his music .
knowing little of the art myself , i was yet certain that none of his harmonies had any relation to music i had heard before ; and concluded that he was a composer of highly original genius .
the longer i listened , the more i was fascinated , until after a week i resolved to make the old man acquaintance .
one night as he was returning from his work , i intercepted zann in the hallway and told him that i would like to know him and be with him when he played .
he was a small , lean , bent person , with shabby clothes , blue eyes , grotesque , satyrlike face , and nearly bald head ; and at my first words seemed both angered and frightened .
my obvious friendliness , however , finally melted him ; and he grudgingly motioned to me to follow him up the dark , creaking and rickety attic stairs .
his room , one of only two in the steeply pitched garret , was on the west side , toward the high wall that formed the upper end of the street .
its size was very great , and seemed the greater because of its extraordinary barrenness and neglect .
of furniture there was only a narrow iron bedstead , a dingy , a small table , a large bookcase , an iron , and three chairs .
sheets of music were piled in disorder about the floor .
the walls were of bare boards , and had probably never known plaster ; whilst the abundance of dust and cobwebs made the place seem more deserted than inhabited .
evidently erich zann world of beauty lay in some far cosmos of the imagination .
motioning me to sit down , the dumb man closed the door , turned the large wooden bolt , and lighted a candle to augment the one he had brought with him .
he now removed his viol from its motheaten covering , and taking it , seated himself in the least uncomfortable of the chairs .
he did not employ the , but , offering no choice and playing from memory , enchanted me for over an hour with strains i had never heard before ; strains which must have been of his own devising .
to describe their exact nature is impossible for one unversed in music .
they were a kind of fugue , with recurrent passages of the most captivating quality , but to me were notable for the absence of any of the weird notes i had overheard from my room below on other occasions .
those haunting notes i had remembered , and had often hummed and whistled inaccurately to myself , so when the player at length laid down his bow i asked him if he would render some of them .
as i began my request the wrinkled satyrlike face lost the bored placidity it had possessed during the playing , and seemed to show the same curious mixture of anger and fright which i had noticed when first i accosted the old man .
for a moment i was inclined to use persuasion , regarding rather lightly the whims of senility ; and even tried to awaken my host weirder mood by whistling a few of the strains to which i had listened the night before .
but i did not pursue this course for more than a moment ; for when the dumb musician recognized the whistled air his face grew suddenly distorted with an expression wholly beyond analysis , and his long , cold , bony right hand reached out to stop my mouth and silence the crude imitation .
as he did this he further demonstrated his eccentricity by casting a startled glance toward the lone curtained window , as if fearful of some intruder a glance doubly absurd , since the garret stood high and inaccessible above all the adjacent roofs , this window being the only point on the steep street , as the concierge had told me , from which one could see over the wall at the summit .
the old man glance brought blandot remark to my mind , and with a certain capriciousness i felt a wish to look out over the wide and dizzying panorama of moonlit roofs and city lights beyond the hilltop , which of all the dwellers in the rue only this crabbed musician could see .
i moved toward the window and would have drawn aside the nondescript curtains , when with a frightened rage even greater than before , the dumb lodger was upon me again ; this time motioning with his head toward the door as he nervously strove to drag me thither with both hands .
now thoroughly disgusted with my host , i ordered him to release me , and told him i would go at once .
his clutch relaxed , and as he saw my disgust and offense , his own anger seemed to subside .
he tightened his relaxing grip , but this time in a friendly manner , forcing me into a chair ; then with an appearance of wistfulness crossing to the littered table , where he wrote many words with a pencil , in the labored french of a foreigner .
the note which he finally handed me was an appeal for tolerance and forgiveness .
zann said that he was old , lonely , and afflicted with strange fears and nervous disorders connected with his music and with other things .
he had enjoyed my listening to his music , and wished i would come again and not mind his eccentricities .
but he could not play to another his weird harmonies , and could not bear hearing them from another ; nor could he bear having anything in his room touched by another .
he had not known until our hallway conversation that i could overhear his playing in my room , and now asked me if i would arrange with blandot to take a lower room where i could not hear him in the night .
he would , he wrote , defray the difference in rent .
as i sat deciphering the execrable french , i felt more lenient toward the old man .
he was a victim of physical and nervous suffering , as was i ; and my metaphysical studies had taught me kindness .
in the silence there came a slight sound from the window the shutter must have rattled in the night wind , and for some reason i started almost as violently as did erich zann .
so when i had finished reading , i shook my host by the hand , and departed as a friend .
the next day blandot gave me a more expensive room on the third floor , between the apartments of an aged and the room of a respectable upholsterer .
there was no one on the fourth floor .
it was not long before i found that zann eagerness for my company was not as great as it had seemed while he was persuading me to move down from the fifth story .
he did not ask me to call on him , and when i did call he appeared uneasy and played listlessly .
this was always at night in the day he slept and would admit no one .
my liking for him did not grow , though the attic room and the weird music seemed to hold an odd fascination for me .
i had a curious desire to look out of that window , over the wall and down the unseen slope at the glittering roofs and spires which must lie outspread there .
once i went up to the garret during theater hours , when zann was away , but the door was locked .
what i did succeed in doing was to overhear the nocturnal playing of the dumb old man .
at first i would up to my old fifth floor , then i grew bold enough to climb the last creaking staircase to the peaked garret .
there in the narrow hall , outside the bolted door with the covered keyhole , i often heard sounds which filled me with an indefinable dread the dread of vague wonder and brooding mystery .
it was not that the sounds were hideous , for they were not ; but that they held vibrations suggesting nothing on this globe of earth , and that at certain intervals they assumed a symphonic quality which i could hardly conceive as produced by one player .
certainly , erich zann was a genius of wild power .
as the weeks passed , the playing grew wilder , whilst the old musician acquired an increasing haggardness and furtiveness pitiful to behold .
he now refused to admit me at any time , and shunned me whenever we met on the stairs .
then one night as i listened at the door , i heard the shrieking viol swell into a chaotic babel of sound ; a pandemonium which would have led me to doubt my own shaking sanity had there not come from behind that barred portal a piteous proof that the horror was real the awful , inarticulate cry which only a mute can utter , and which rises only in moments of the most terrible fear or anguish .
i knocked repeatedly at the door , but received no response .
afterward i waited in the black hallway , shivering with cold and fear , till i heard the poor musician feeble effort to rise from the floor by the aid of a chair .
believing him just conscious after a fainting fit , i renewed my rapping , at the same time calling out my name reassuringly .
i heard zann stumble to the window and close both shutter and sash , then stumble to the door , which he falteringly unfastened to admit me .
this time his delight at having me present was real ; for his distorted face gleamed with relief while he clutched at my coat as a child clutches at its mother skirts .
shaking pathetically , the old man forced me into a chair whilst he sank into another , beside which his viol and bow lay carelessly on the floor .
he sat for some time inactive , nodding oddly , but having a paradoxical suggestion of intense and frightened listening .
subsequently he seemed to be satisfied , and crossing to a chair by the table wrote a brief note , handed it to me , and returned to the table , where he began to write rapidly and incessantly .
the note implored me in the name of mercy , and for the sake of my own curiosity , to wait where i was while he prepared a full account in german of all the marvels and terrors which beset him .
i waited , and the dumb man pencil flew .
it was perhaps an hour later , while i still waited and while the old musician feverishly written sheets still continued to pile up , that i saw zann start as from the hint of a horrible shock .
unmistakably he was looking at the curtained window and listening shudderingly .
then i half fancied i heard a sound myself ; though it was not a horrible sound , but rather an exquisitely low and infinitely distant musical note , suggesting a player in one of the neighboring houses , or in some abode beyond the lofty wall over which i had never been able to look .
upon zann the effect was terrible , for , dropping his pencil , suddenly he rose , seized his viol , and commenced to rend the night with the wildest playing i had ever heard from his bow save when listening at the barred door .
it would be useless to describe the playing of erich zann on that dreadful night .
it was more horrible than anything i had ever overheard , because i could now see the expression of his face , and could realize that this time the motive was stark fear .
he was trying to make a noise ; to ward something off or drown something out what , i could not imagine , awesome though i felt it must be .
the playing grew fantastic , dehnous , and hysterical , yet kept to the last the qualities of supreme genius which i knew this strange old man possessed .
i recognized the air it was a wild hungarian dance popular in the theaters , and i reflected for a moment that this was the first time i had ever heard zann play the work of another composer .
louder and louder , wilder and wilder , mounted the shrieking and whining of that desperate viol .
the player was dripping with an uncanny perspiration and twisted like a monkey , always looking frantically at the curtained window .
in his frenzied strains i could almost see shadowy satyrs and bacchanals dancing and whirling insanely through seething abysses of clouds and smoke and lightning .
and then i thought i heard a shriller , steadier note that was not from the viol ; a calm , deliberate , purposeful , mocking note from far away in the west .
at this juncture the shutter began to rattle in a howling night wind which had sprung up outside as if in answer to the mad playing within .
zann screaming viol now outdid itself emitting sounds i had never thought a viol could emit .
the shutter rattled more loudly , unfastened , and commenced slamming against the window .
then the glass broke shiveringly under the persistent impacts , and the chill wind rushed in , making the candles sputter and rustling the sheets of paper on the table where zann had begun to write out his horrible secret .
i looked at zann , and saw that he was past conscious observation .
his blue eyes were bulging , glassy and sightless , and the frantic playing had become a blind , mechanical , unrecognizable orgy that no pen could even suggest .
a sudden gust , stronger than the others , caught up the manuscript and bore it toward the window .
i followed the flying sheets in desperation , but they were gone before i reached the demolished panes .
then i remembered my old wish to gaze from this window , the only window in the rue from which one might see the slope beyond the wall , and the city outspread beneath .
it was very dark , but the city lights always burned , and i expected to see them there amidst the rain and wind .
yet when i looked from that highest of all gable windows , looked while the candles sputtered and the insane viol howled with the , i saw no city spread below , and no friendly lights gleamed from remembered streets , but only the blackness of space illimitable ; unimagined space alive with motion and music , and having no semblance of anything on earth .
and as i stood there looking in terror , the wind blew out both the candles in that ancient peaked garret , leaving me in savage and impenetrable darkness with chaos and pandemonium before me , and the demon madness of that viol behind me .
i staggered back in the dark , without the means of striking a light , crashing against the table , overturning a chair , and finally groping my way to the place where the blackness screamed with shocking music .
to save myself and erich zann i could at least try , whatever the powers opposed to me .
once i thought some chill thing brushed me , and i screamed , but my scream could not be heard above that hideous viol .
suddenly out of the blackness the madly sawing bow struck me , and i knew i was close to the player .
i felt ahead , touched the back of zann chair , and then found and shook his shoulder in an effort to bring him to his senses .
he did not respond , and still the viol shrieked on without slackening .
i moved my hand to his head , whose mechanical nodding i was able to stop , and shouted in his ear that we must both flee from the unknown things of the night .
but he neither answered me nor abated the frenzy of his unutterable music , while all through the garret strange currents of wind seemed to dance in the darkness and babel .
when my hand touched his ear i shuddered , though i knew not why knew not why till i felt the still face ; the , stiffened , unbreathing face whose glassy eyes bulged uselessly into the void .
and then , by some miracle , finding the door and the large wooden bolt , i plunged wildly away from that thing in the dark , and from the ghoulish howling of that accursed viol whose fury increased even as i plunged .
leaping , floating , flying down those endless stairs through the dark house ; racing mindlessly out into the narrow , steep , and ancient street of steps and tottering houses ; clattering down steps and over cobbles to the lower streets and the putrid river ; panting across the great dark bridge to the broader , healthier streets and boulevards we know ; all these are terrible impressions that linger with me .
and i recall that there was no wind , and that the moon was out , and that all the lights of the city twinkled .
despite my most careful searches and investigations , i have never since been able to find the rue .
but i am not wholly sorry ; either for this or for the loss in undreamable abysses of the closely written sheets which alone could have explained the music of erich zann .
but now they have betaken themselves to unknown kadath in the cold waste where no man treads , and are grown stern , having no higher peak whereto to flee at the coming of men .
they are grown stern , and where once they suffered men to displace them , they now forbid men to come ; or coming , to depart .
it is well for men that they know not of kadath in the cold waste ; else they would seek injudiciously to scale it .
sometimes when earth gods are homesick they visit in the still of the night the peaks where once they dwelt , and weep softly as they try to play in the olden way on remembered slopes .
men have felt the tears of the gods on thurai , though they have thought it rain ; and have heard the sighs of the gods in the plaintive of lerion .
in the gods are wont to travel , and wise cotters have legends that keep them from certain high peaks at night when it is cloudy , for the gods are not lenient as of old .
in ulthar , which lies beyond the river skai , once dwelt an old man avid to behold the gods of earth ; a man deeply learned in the seven cryptical books of earth , and familiar with the pnakotic manuscripts of distant and frozen lomar .
his name was barzai the wise , and the villagers tell of how he went up a mountain on the night of the strange eclipse .
barzai knew so much of the gods that he could tell of their comings and goings , and guessed so many of their secrets that he was deemed half a god himself .
it was he who wisely advised the burgesses of ulthar when they passed their remarkable law against the slaying of cats , and who first told the young priest atal where it is that black cats go at midnight on john eve .
barzai was learned in the lore of the earth gods , and had gained a desire to look upon their faces .
he believed that his great secret knowledge of gods could shield him from their wrath , so resolved to go up to the summit of high and rocky on a night when he knew the gods would be there .
is far in the stony desert beyond hatheg , for which it is named , and rises like a rock statue in a silent temple .
around its peak the mists play always mournfully , for mists are the memories of the gods , and the gods loved when they dwelt upon it in the old days .
often the gods of earth visit in their ships of clouds , casting pale vapors over the slopes as they dance reminiscently on the summit under a clear moon .
the villagers of hatheg say it is ill to climb the at any time , and deadly to climb it by night when pale vapors hide the summit and the moon ; but barzai heeded them not when he came from neighboring ulthar with the young priest atal , who was his disciple .
atal was only the son of an innkeeper , and was sometimes afraid ; but barzai father had been a landgrave who dwelt in an ancient castle , so he had no common superstition in his blood , and only laughed at the fearful cotters .
banzai and atal went out of hatheg into the stony desert despite the prayers of peasants , and talked of earth gods by their campfires at night .
many days they traveled , and from afar saw lofty with his aureole of mournful mist .
on the thirteenth day they reached the mountain lonely base , and atal spoke of his fears .
but barzai was old and learned and had no fears , so led the way up the slope that no man had scaled since the time of sansu , who is written of with fright in the moldy pnakotic manuscripts .
the way was rocky , and made perilous by chasms , cliffs , and falling stones .
later it grew cold and snowy ; and barzai and atal often slipped and fell as they hewed and plodded upward with staves and axes .
finally the air grew thin , and the sky changed color , and the climbers found it hard to breathe ; but still they toiled up and up , marveling at the strangeness of the scene and thrilling at the thought of what would happen on the summit when the moon was out and the pale vapours spread around .
for three days they climbed higher and higher toward the roof of the world ; then they camped to wait for the clouding of the moon .
for four nights no clouds came , and the moon shone down cold through the thin mournful mist around the silent pinnacle .
then on the fifth night , which was the night of the full moon , barzai saw some dense clouds far to the north , and stayed up with atal to watch them draw near .
thick and majestic they sailed , slowly and deliberately onward ; ranging themselves round the peak high above the watchers , and hiding the moon and the summit from view .
for a long hour the watchers gazed , whilst the vapours swirled and the screen of clouds grew thicker and more restless .
barzai was wise in the lore of earth gods , and listened hard for certain sounds , but atal felt the chill of the vapours and the awe of the night , and feared much .
and when barzai began to climb higher and beckon eagerly , it was long before atal would follow .
so thick were the vapours that the way was hard , and though atal followed at last , he could scarce see the gray shape of barzai on the dim slope above in the clouded moonlight .
barzai forged very far ahead , and seemed despite his age to climb more easily than atal ; fearing not the steepness that began to grow too great for any save a strong and dauntless man , nor pausing at wide black chasms that atal could scarce leap .
and so they went up wildly over rocks and gulfs , slipping and stumbling , and sometimes awed at the vastness and horrible silence of bleak ice pinnacles and mute granite steeps .
very suddenly barzai went out of atal sight , scaling a hideous cliff that seemed to bulge outward and block the path for any climber not inspired of earth gods .
atal was far below , and planning what he should do when he reached the place , when curiously he noticed that the light had grown strong , as if the cloudless peak and moonlit meetingplace of the gods were very near .
and as he scrambled on toward the bulging cliff and litten sky he felt fears more shocking than any he had known before .
then through the high mists he heard the voice of barzai shouting wildly in delight i have heard the gods .
i have heard earth gods singing in revelry on !
the voices of earth gods are known to barzai the prophet !
the mists are thin and the moon is bright , and i shall see the gods dancing wildly on that they loved in youth .
the wisdom of barzai hath made him greater than earth gods , and against his will their spells and barriers are as naught ; barzai will behold the gods , the proud gods , the secret gods , the gods of earth who spurn the sight of man !
atal could not hear the voices barzai heard , but he was now close to the bulging cliff and scanning it for footholds .
then he heard barzai voice grow shriller and louder the mist is very thin , and the moon casts shadows on the slope ; the voices of earth gods are high and wild , and they fear the coming of barzai the wise , who is greater than they the moon light flickers , as earth gods dance against it ; i shall see the dancing forms of the gods that leap and howl in the moonlight the light is dimmer and the gods are afraid whilst barzai was shouting these things atal felt a spectral change in all the air , as if the laws of earth were bowing to greater laws ; for though the way was steeper than ever , the upward path was now grown fearsomely easy , and the bulging cliff proved scarce an obstacle when he reached it and slid perilously up its convex face .
the light of the moon had strangely failed , and as atal plunged upward through the mists he heard barzai the wise shrieking in the shadows the moon is dark , and the gods dance in the night ; there is terror in the sky , for upon the moon hath sunk an eclipse foretold in no books of men or of earth gods there is unknown magic on , for the screams of the frightened gods have turned to laughter , and the slopes of ice shoot up endlessly into the black heavens whither i am plunging hei !
hei !
at last !
in the dim light i behold the gods of earth !
and now atal , slipping dizzily up over inconceivable steeps , heard in the dark a loathsome laughing , mixed with such a cry as no man else ever heard save in the phlegethon of unrelatable nightmares ; a cry wherein reverberated the horror and anguish of a haunted lifetime packed into one atrocious moment the other gods !
the other gods !
the gods of the outer hells that guard the feeble gods of earth ! look away go back do not see !
do not see !
the vengeance of the infinite abysses that cursed , that damnable pit merciful gods of earth , i am falling into the sky !
and as atal shut his eyes and stopped his ears and tried to hump downward against the frightful pull from unknown heights , there resounded on that terrible peal of thunder which awaked the good cotters of the plains and the honest burgesses of hatheg , nir and ulthar , and caused them to behold through the clouds that strange eclipse of the moon that no book ever predicted .
and when the moon came out at last atal was safe on the lower snows of the mountain without sight of earth gods , or of the other gods .
now it is told in the moldy pnakotic manuscripts that sansu found naught but wordless ice and rock when he did climb in the youth of the world .
yet when the men of ulthar and nir and hatheg crushed their fears and scaled that haunted steep by day in search of barzai the wise , they found graven in the naked stone of the summit a curious and cyclopean symbol fifty cubits wide , as if the rock had been riven by some titanic chisel .
and the symbol was like to one that learned men have discerned in those frightful parts of the pnakotic manuscripts which were too ancient to be read .
this they found .
barzai the wise they never found , nor could the holy priest atal ever be persuaded to pray for his soul repose .
moreover , to this day the people of ulthar and nir and hatheg fear eclipses , and pray by night when pale vapors hide the and the moon .
and above the mists on , earth gods sometimes dance reminiscently ; for they know they are safe , and love to come from unknown kadath in ships of clouds and play in the olden way , as they did when earth was new and men not given to the climbing of inaccessible places .
unhappy is he to whom the memories of childhood bring only fear and sadness .
wretched is he who looks back upon lone hours in vast and dismal chambers with brown hangings and maddening rows of antique books , or upon awed watches in twilight groves of grotesque , gigantic , and trees that silently wave twisted branches far aloft .
such a lot the gods gave to me to me , the dazed , the disappointed ; the barren , the broken .
and yet i am strangely content and cling desperately to those sere memories , when my mind momentarily threatens to reach beyond to the other .
i know not where i was born , save that the castle was infinitely old and infinitely horrible , full of dark passages and having high ceilings where the eye could find only cobwebs and shadows .
the stones in the crumbling corridors seemed always hideously damp , and there was an accursed smell everywhere , as of the corpses of dead generations .
it was never light , so that i used sometimes to light candles and gaze steadily at them for relief , nor was there any sun outdoors , since the terrible trees grew high above the topmost accessible tower .
there was one black tower which reached above the trees into the unknown outer sky , but that was partly ruined and could not be ascended save by a impossible climb up the sheer wall , stone by stone .
i must have lived years in this place , but i can not measure the time .
beings must have cared for my needs , yet i can not recall any person except myself , or anything alive but the noiseless rats and bats and spiders .
i think that whoever nursed me must have been shockingly aged , since my first conception of a living person was that of somebody mockingly like myself , yet distorted , shrivelled , and decaying like the castle .
to me there was nothing grotesque in the bones and skeletons that strewed some of the stone crypts deep down among the foundations .
i fantastically associated these things with everyday events , and thought them more natural than the coloured pictures of living beings which i found in many of the mouldy books .
from such books i learned all that i know .
no teacher urged or guided me , and i do not recall hearing any human voice in all those years not even my own ; for although i had read of speech , i had never thought to try to speak aloud .
my aspect was a matter equally unthought of , for there were no mirrors in the castle , and i merely regarded myself by instinct as akin to the youthful figures i saw drawn and painted in the books .
i felt conscious of youth because i remembered so little .
outside , across the putrid moat and under the dark mute trees , i would often lie and dream for hours about what i read in the books ; and would longingly picture myself amidst gay crowds in the sunny world beyond the endless forests .
once i tried to escape from the forest , but as i went farther from the castle the shade grew denser and the air more filled with brooding fear ; so that i ran frantically back lest i lose my way in a labyrinth of nighted silence .
so through endless twilights i dreamed and waited , though i knew not what i waited for .
then in the shadowy solitude my longing for light grew so frantic that i could rest no more , and i lifted entreating hands to the single black ruined tower that reached above the forest into the unknown outer sky .
and at last i resolved to scale that tower , fall though i might ; since it were better to glimpse the sky and perish , than to live without ever beholding day .
in the dank twilight i climbed the worn and aged stone stairs till i reached the level where they ceased , and thereafter clung perilously to small footholds leading upward .
ghastly and terrible was that dead , stairless cylinder of rock ; black , ruined , and deserted , and sinister with startled bats whose wings made no noise .
but more ghastly and terrible still was the slowness of my progress ; for climb as i might , the darkness overhead grew no thinner , and a new chill as of haunted and venerable mould assailed me .
i shivered as i wondered why i did not reach the light , and would have looked down had i dared .
i fancied that night had come suddenly upon me , and vainly groped with one free hand for a window embrasure , that i might peer out and above , and try to judge the height i had once attained .
all at once , after an infinity of awesome , sightless , crawling up that concave and desperate precipice , i felt my head touch a solid thing , and i knew i must have gained the roof , or at least some kind of floor .
in the darkness i raised my free hand and tested the barrier , finding it stone and immovable .
then came a deadly circuit of the tower , clinging to whatever holds the slimy wall could give ; till finally my testing hand found the barrier yielding , and i turned upward again , pushing the slab or door with my head as i used both hands in my fearful ascent .
there was no light revealed above , and as my hands went higher i knew that my climb was for the nonce ended ; since the slab was the trapdoor of an aperture leading to a level stone surface of greater circumference than the lower tower , no doubt the floor of some lofty and capacious observation chamber .
i crawled through carefully , and tried to prevent the heavy slab from falling back into place , but failed in the latter attempt .
as i lay exhausted on the stone floor i heard the eerie echoes of its fall , hoped when necessary to pry it up again .
believing i was now at prodigious height , far above the accursed branches of the wood , i dragged myself up from the floor and fumbled about for windows , that i might look for the first time upon the sky , and the moon and stars of which i had read .
but on every hand i was disappointed ; since all that i found were vast shelves of marble , bearing odious oblong boxes of disturbing size .
more and more i reflected , and wondered what hoary secrets might abide in this high apartment so many aeons cut off from the castle below .
then unexpectedly my hands came upon a doorway , where hung a portal of stone , rough with strange chiselling .
trying it , i found it locked ; but with a supreme burst of strength i overcame all obstacles and dragged it open inward .
as i did so there came to me the purest ecstasy i have ever known ; for shining tranquilly through an ornate grating of iron , and down a short stone passageway of steps that ascended from the newly found doorway , was the radiant full moon , which i had never before seen save in dreams and in vague visions i dared not call memories .
fancying now that i had attained the very pinnacle of the castle , i commenced to rush up the few steps beyond the door ; but the sudden veiling of the moon by a cloud caused me to stumble , and i felt my way more slowly in the dark .
it was still very dark when i reached the grating which i tried carefully and found unlocked , but which i did not open for fear of falling from the amazing height to which i had climbed .
then the moon came out .
most demoniacal of all shocks is that of the abysmally unexpected and grotesquely unbelievable .
nothing i had before undergone could compare in terror with what i now saw ; with the bizarre marvels that sight implied .
the sight itself was as simple as it was stupefying , for it was merely this instead of a dizzying prospect of treetops seen from a lofty eminence , there stretched around me on the level through the grating nothing less than the solid ground , decked and diversified by marble slabs and columns , and overshadowed by an ancient stone church , whose ruined spire gleamed spectrally in the moonlight .
half unconscious , i opened the grating and staggered out upon the white gravel path that stretched away in two directions .
my mind , stunned and chaotic as it was , still held the frantic craving for light ; and not even the fantastic wonder which had happened could stay my course .
i neither knew nor cared whether my experience was insanity , dreaming , or magic ; but was determined to gaze on brilliance and gaiety at any cost .
i knew not who i was or what i was , or what my surroundings might be ; though as i continued to stumble along i became conscious of a kind of fearsome latent memory that made my progress not wholly fortuitous .
i passed under an arch out of that region of slabs and columns , and wandered through the open country ; sometimes following the visible road , but sometimes leaving it curiously to tread across meadows where only occasional ruins bespoke the ancient presence of a forgotten road .
once i swam across a swift river where crumbling , mossy masonry told of a bridge long vanished .
over two hours must have passed before i reached what seemed to be my goal , a venerable ivied castle in a thickly wooded park , maddeningly familiar , yet full of perplexing strangeness to me .
i saw that the moat was filled in , and that some of the towers were demolished , whilst new wings existed to confuse the beholder .
but what i observed with chief interest and delight were the open windows gorgeously ablaze with light and sending forth sound of the gayest revelry .
advancing to one of these i looked in and saw an oddly dressed company indeed ; making merry , and speaking brightly to one another .
i had never , seemingly , heard human speech before and could guess only vaguely what was said .
some of the faces seemed to hold expressions that brought up incredibly remote recollections , others were utterly alien .
i now stepped through the low window into the brilliantly lighted room , stepping as i did so from my single bright moment of hope to my blackest convulsion of despair and realization .
the nightmare was quick to come , for as i entered , there occurred immediately one of the most terrifying demonstrations i had ever conceived .
scarcely had i crossed the sill when there descended upon the whole company a sudden and unheralded fear of hideous intensity , distorting every face and evoking the most horrible screams from nearly every throat .
flight was universal , and in the clamour and panic several fell in a swoon and were dragged away by their madly fleeing companions .
many covered their eyes with their hands , and plunged blindly and awkwardly in their race to escape , overturning furniture and stumbling against the walls before they managed to reach one of the many doors .
the cries were shocking ; and as i stood in the brilliant apartment alone and dazed , listening to their vanishing echoes , i trembled at the thought of what might be lurking near me unseen .
at a casual inspection the room seemed deserted , but when i moved towards one of the alcoves i thought i detected a presence there a hint of motion beyond the doorway leading to another and somewhat similar room .
as i approached the arch i began to perceive the presence more clearly ; and then , with the first and last sound i ever uttered a ghastly ululation that revolted me almost as poignantly as its noxious cause i beheld in full , frightful vividness the inconceivable , indescribable , and unmentionable monstrosity which had by its simple appearance changed a merry company to a herd of delirious fugitives .
i can not even hint what it was like , for it was a compound of all that is unclean , uncanny , unwelcome , abnormal , and detestable .
it was the ghoulish shade of decay , antiquity , and dissolution ; the putrid , dripping eidolon of unwholesome revelation , the awful baring of that which the merciful earth should always hide .
god knows it was not of this world or no longer of this world yet to my horror i saw in its and outlines a leering , abhorrent travesty on the human shape ; and in its mouldy , disintegrating apparel an unspeakable quality that chilled me even more .
i was almost paralysed , but not too much so to make a feeble effort towards flight ; a backward stumble which failed to break the spell in which the nameless , voiceless monster held me .
my eyes bewitched by the glassy orbs which stared loathsomely into them , refused to close ; though they were mercifully blurred , and showed the terrible object but indistinctly after the first shock .
i tried to raise my hand to shut out the sight , yet so stunned were my nerves that my arm could not fully obey my will .
the attempt , however , was enough to disturb my balance ; so that i had to stagger forward several steps to avoid falling .
as i did so i became suddenly and agonizingly aware of the nearness of the carrion thing , whose hideous hollow breathing i half fancied i could hear .
nearly mad , i found myself yet able to throw out a hand to ward of the foetid apparition which pressed so close ; when in one cataclysmic second of cosmic nightmarishness and hellish accident my fingers touched the rotting outstretched paw of the monster beneath the golden arch .
i did not shriek , but all the fiendish ghouls that ride the nightwind shrieked for me as in that same second there crashed down upon my mind a single fleeting avalanche of memory .
i knew in that second all that had been ; i remembered beyond the frightful castle and the trees , and recognized the altered edifice in which i now stood ; i recognized , most terrible of all , the unholy abomination that stood leering before me as i withdrew my sullied fingers from its own .
but in the cosmos there is balm as well as bitterness , and that balm is nepenthe .
in the supreme horror of that second i forgot what had horrified me , and the burst of black memory vanished in a chaos of echoing images .
in a dream i fled from that haunted and accursed pile , and ran swiftly and silently in the moonlight .
when i returned to the churchyard place of marble and went down the steps i found the stone immovable ; but i was not sorry , for i had hated the antique castle and the trees .
now i ride with the mocking and friendly ghouls on the , and play by day amongst the catacombs of in the sealed and unknown valley of hadoth by the nile .
i know that light is not for me , save that of the moon over the rock tombs of neb , nor any gaiety save the unnamed feasts of nitokris beneath the great pyramid ; yet in my new wildness and freedom i almost welcome the bitterness of alienage .
for although nepenthe has calmed me , i know always that i am an outsider ; a stranger in this century and among those who are still men .
this i have known ever since i stretched out my fingers to the abomination within that great gilded frame ; stretched out my fingers and touched a cold and unyielding surface of polished glass .
most horrible of all sights are the little unpainted wooden houses remote from travelled ways , usually squatted upon some damp grassy slope or leaning against some gigantic outcropping of rock .
two hundred years and more they have leaned or squatted there , while the vines have crawled and the trees have swelled and spread .
they are almost hidden now in lawless luxuriances of green and guardian shrouds of shadow ; but the windows still stare shockingly , as if blinking through a lethal stupor which wards off madness by dulling the memory of unutterable things .
in such houses have dwelt generations of strange people , whose like the world has never seen .
seized with a gloomy and fanatical belief which exiled them from their kind , their ancestors sought the wilderness for freedom .
there the scions of a conquering race indeed flourished free from the restrictions of their fellows , but cowered in an appalling slavery to the dismal phantasms of their own minds .
divorced from the enlightenment of civilization , the strength of these puritans turned into singular channels ; and in their isolation , morbid , and struggle for life with relentless nature , there came to them dark furtive traits from the prehistoric depths of their cold northern heritage .
by necessity practical and by philosophy stern , these folks were not beautiful in their sins .
erring as all mortals must , they were forced by their rigid code to seek concealment above all else ; so that they came to use less and less taste in what they concealed .
only the silent , sleepy , staring houses in the backwoods can tell all that has lain hidden since the early days , and they are not communicative , being loath to shake off the drowsiness which helps them forget .
sometimes one feels that it would be merciful to tear down these houses , for they must often dream .
it was to a edifice of this description that i was driven one afternoon in november , , by a rain of such chilling copiousness that any shelter was preferable to exposure .
i had been travelling for some time amongst the people of the miskatonic valley in quest of certain genealogical data ; and from the remote , devious , and problematical nature of my course , had deemed it convenient to employ a bicycle despite the lateness of the season .
now i found myself upon an apparently abandoned road which i had chosen as the shortest cut to arkham , overtaken by the storm at a point far from any town , and confronted with no refuge save the antique and repellent wooden building which blinked with bleared windows from between two huge leafless elms near the foot of a rocky hill .
distant though it is from the remnant of a road , this house none the less impressed me unfavorably the very moment i espied it .
honest , wholesome structures do not stare at travellers so slyly and hauntingly , and in my genealogical researches i had encountered legends of a century before which biased me against places of this kind .
yet the force of the elements was such as to overcome my scruples , and i did not hesitate to wheel my machine up the weedy rise to the closed door which seemed at once so suggestive and secretive .
i had somehow taken it for granted that the house was abandoned , yet as i approached it i was not so sure , for though the walks were indeed overgrown with weeds , they seemed to retain their nature a little too well to argue complete desertion .
therefore instead of trying the door i knocked , feeling as i did so a trepidation i could scarcely explain .
as i waited on the rough , mossy rock which served as a , i glanced at the neighboring windows and the panes of the transom above me , and noticed that although old , rattling , and almost opaque with dirt , they were not broken .
the building , then , must still be inhabited , despite its isolation and general neglect .
however , my rapping evoked no response , so after repeating the summons i tried the rusty latch and found the door unfastened .
inside was a little vestibule with walls from which the plaster was falling , and through the doorway came a faint but peculiarly hateful odor .
i entered , carrying my bicycle , and closed the door behind me .
ahead rose a narrow staircase , flanked by a small door probably leading to the cellar , while to the left and right were closed doors leading to rooms on the ground floor .
leaning my cycle against the wall i opened the door at the left , and crossed into a small chamber but dimly lighted by its two dusty windows and furnished in the barest and most primitive possible way .
it appeared to be a kind of , for it had a table and several chairs , and an immense fireplace above which ticked an antique clock on a mantel .
books and papers were very few , and in the prevailing gloom i could not readily discern the titles .
what interested me was the uniform air of archaism as displayed in every visible detail .
most of the houses in this region i had found rich in relics of the past , but here the antiquity was curiously complete ; for in all the room i could not discover a single article of definitely date .
had the furnishings been less humble , the place would have been a collector paradise .
as i surveyed this quaint apartment , i felt an increase in that aversion first excited by the bleak exterior of the house .
just what it was that i feared or loathed , i could by no means define ; but something in the whole atmosphere seemed redolent of unhallowed age , of unpleasant crudeness , and of secrets which should be forgotten .
i felt disinclined to sit down , and wandered about examining the various articles which i had noticed .
the first object of my curiosity was a book of medium size lying upon the table and presenting such an antediluvian aspect that i marvelled at beholding it outside a museum or library .
it was bound in leather with metal fittings , and was in an excellent state of preservation ; being altogether an unusual sort of volume to encounter in an abode so lowly .
when i opened it to the title page my wonder grew even greater , for it proved to be nothing less rare than pigafetta account of the congo region , written in latin from the notes of the sailor lopex and printed at frankfurt in .
i had often heard of this work , with its curious illustrations by the brothers de bry , hence for a moment forgot my uneasiness in my desire to turn the pages before me .
the engravings were indeed interesting , drawn wholly from imagination and careless descriptions , and represented negroes with white skins and caucasian features ; nor would i soon have closed the book had not an exceedingly trivial circumstance upset my tired nerves and revived my sensation of disquiet .
what annoyed me was merely the persistent way in which the volume tended to fall open of itself at plate , which represented in gruesome detail a butcher shop of the cannibal anziques .
i experienced some shame at my susceptibility to so slight a thing , but the drawing nevertheless disturbed me , especially in connection with some adjacent passages descriptive of anzique gastronomy .
i had turned to a neighboring shelf and was examining its meagre literary contents an eighteenth century bible , a pilgrim progress of like period , illustrated with grotesque woodcuts and printed by the isaiah thomas , the rotting bulk of cotton mather magnalia christi americana , and a few other books of evidently equal age when my attention was aroused by the unmistakable sound of walking in the room overhead .
at first astonished and startled , considering the lack of response to my recent knocking at the door , i immediately afterward concluded that the walker had just awakened from a sound sleep , and listened with less surprise as the footsteps sounded on the creaking stairs .
the tread was heavy , yet seemed to contain a curious quality of cautiousness ; a quality which i disliked the more because the tread was heavy .
when i had entered the room i had shut the door behind me .
now , after a moment of silence during which the walker may have been inspecting my bicycle in the hall , i heard a fumbling at the latch and saw the paneled portal swing open again .
in the doorway stood a person of such singular appearance that i should have exclaimed aloud but for the restraints of good breeding .
old , , and ragged , my host possessed a countenance and physique which inspired equal wonder and respect .
his height could not have been less than six feet , and despite a general air of age and poverty he was stout and powerful in proportion .
his face , almost hidden by a long beard which grew high on the cheeks , seemed abnormally ruddy and less wrinkled than one might expect ; while over a high forehead fell a shock of white hair little thinned by the years .
his blue eyes , though a trifle bloodshot , seemed inexplicably keen and burning .
but for his horrible unkemptness the man would have been as as he was impressive .
this unkemptness , however , made him offensive despite his face and figure .
of what his clothing consisted i could hardly tell , for it seemed to me no more than a mass of tatters surmounting a pair of high , heavy boots ; and his lack of cleanliness surpassed description .
the appearance of this man , and the instinctive fear he inspired , prepared me for something like enmity ; so that i almost shuddered through surprise and a sense of uncanny incongruity when he motioned me to a chair and addressed me in a thin , weak voice full of fawning respect and ingratiating hospitality .
his speech was very curious , an extreme form of yankee dialect i had thought long extinct ; and i studied it closely as he sat down opposite me for conversation .
ketched in the rain , be ye ?
he greeted .
glad ye was nigh the haouse en ' hed the sense ta come right in .
i i was alseep , else i a heerd ye i ai as young as i uster be , an ' i need a paowerful sight o ' naps naowadays .
fur ?
i hai seed many folks this rud sence they tuk off the arkham stage .
i replied that i was going to arkham , and apologized for my rude entry into his domicile , whereupon he continued .
glad ta see ye , young sir new faces is scurce arount here , an ' i hai got much ta cheer me up these days .
guess yew hail from bosting , do ye ?
i never ben thar , but i kin tell a taown man when i see we hed one fer deestrick schoolmaster in , but he quit suddent an ' no one never heerd on sence here the old man lapsed into a kind of chuckle , and made no explanation when i questioned him .
he seemed to be in an aboundingly good humor , yet to possess those eccentricities which one might guess from his grooming .
for some time he rambled on with an almost feverish geniality , when it struck me to ask him how he came by so rare a book as pigafetta regnum congo .
the effect of this volume had not left me , and i felt a certain hesitancy in speaking of it , but curiosity overmastered all the vague fears which had steadily accumulated since my first glimpse of the house .
to my relief , the question did not seem an awkward one , for the old man answered freely and volubly .
oh , that afriky book ?
ebenezer holt traded me thet in eight him as was kilt in the war .
something about the name of ebenezer holt caused me to look up sharply .
i had encountered it in my genealogical work , but not in any record since the revolution .
i wondered if my host could help me in the task at which i was laboring , and resolved to ask him about it later on .
he continued .
ebenezer was on a salem merchantman for years , an ' picked up a sight o ' queer stuff in every port .
he got this in london , i guess he uster like ter buy things at the shops .
i was up ta his haouse onct , on the hill , tradin ' hosses , when i see this book .
i relished the picters , so he give it in on a swap .
is a queer book here , leave me git on my spectacles the old man fumbled among his rags , producing a pair of dirty and amazingly antique glasses with small octagonal lenses and steel bows .
donning these , he reached for the volume on the table and turned the pages lovingly .
ebenezer cud read a leetle o ' this is latin but i ca .
i had two er three schoolmasters read me a bit , and passon clark , him they say got draownded in the pond kin yew make anything outen it ?
i told him that i could , and translated for his benefit a paragraph near the beginning .
if i erred , he was not scholar enough to correct me ; for he seemed childishly pleased at my english version .
his proximity was becoming rather obnoxious , yet i saw no way to escape without offending him .
i was amused at the childish fondness of this ignorant old man for the pictures in a book he could not read , and wondered how much better he could read the few books in english which adorned the room .
this revelation of simplicity removed much of the apprehension i had felt , and i smiled as my host rambled on queer haow picters kin set a body thinkin ' .
take this un here near the front .
hey yew ever seed trees like thet , with big leaves a floppin ' over an ' daown ?
and them men them ca be niggers they dew beat all .
kinder like injuns , i guess , even ef they be in afriky .
some o ' these here critters looks like monkeys , or half monkeys an ' half men , but i never heerd o ' nothin ' like this un .
here he pointed to a fabulous creature of the artist , which one might describe as a sort of dragon with the head of an alligator .
but naow i show ye the best un over here nigh the middle the old man speech grew a trifle thicker and his eyes assumed a brighter glow ; but his fumbling hands , though seemingly clumsier than before , were entirely adequate to their mission .
the book fell open , almost of its own accord and as if from frequent consultation at this place , to the repellent twelfth plate showing a butcher shop amongst the anzique cannibals .
my sense of restlessness returned , though i did not exhibit it .
the especially bizarre thing was that the artist had made his africans look like white men the limbs and quarters hanging about the walls of the shop were ghastly , while the butcher with his axe was hideously incongruous .
but my host seemed to relish the view as much as i disliked it .
what d think o ' this ai never see the like hereabouts , eh ?
when i see this i telled eb holt , suthin ' ta stir ye up an ' make yer blood tickle . '
when i read in scripter about slayin ' like them midianites was slew i kinder think things , but i ai got no picter of it .
here a body kin see all they is to it i is sinful , but ai we all born an ' livin ' in sin ? thet feller bein ' chopped up gives me a tickle every time i look at i hey ta keep lookin ' at see whar the butcher cut off his feet ?
thar his head on thet bench , with one arm side of it , an ' arm on the other side o ' the meat block .
as the man mumbled on in his shocking ecstasy the expression on his hairy , spectacled face became indescribable , but his voice sank rather than mounted .
my own sensations can scarcely be recorded .
all the terror i had dimly felt before rushed upon me actively and vividly , and i knew that i loathed the ancient and abhorrent creature so near me with an infinite intensity .
his madness , or at least his partial perversion , seemed beyond dispute .
he was almost whispering now , with a huskiness more terrible than a scream , and i trembled as i listened .
as i says , is queer haow picters sets ye thinkin ' .
d know , young sir , i right sot on this un here .
arter i got the book off eb i uster look at it a lot , especial when i heerd passon clark rant o ' sundays in his big wig .
onct i tried suthin ' funny here , young sir , do git skeert all i done was ter look at the picter afore i kilt the sheep for market killin ' sheep was kinder more fun arter lookin ' at it the tone of the old man now sank very low , sometimes becoming so faint that his words were hardly audible .
i listened to the rain , and to the rattling of the bleared , windows , and marked a rumbling of approaching thunder quite unusual for the season .
once a terrific flash and peal shook the frail house to its foundations , but the whisperer seemed not to notice it .
killin ' sheep was kinder more fun but d know , quite satisfyin ' .
queer haow a cravin ' gits a holt on ye as ye love the almighty , young man , do tell nobody , but i swar ter gawd thet picter begun to make me hungry fer victuals i could raise nor buy here , set still , what ailin ' ye ? i did do nothin ' , only i wondered haow be ef i did they say meat makes blood an ' flesh , an ' gives ye new life , so i wondered ef make a man live longer an ' longer ef was more the same but the whisperer never continued .
the interruption was not produced by my fright , nor by the rapidly increasing storm amidst whose fury i was presently to open my eyes on a smoky solitude of blackened ruins .
it was produced by a very simple though somewhat unusual happening .
the open book lay flat between us , with the picture staring repulsively upward .
as the old man whispered the words more the same a tiny splattering impact was heard , and something showed on the yellowed paper of the upturned volume .
i thought of the rain and of a leaky roof , but rain is not red .
on the butcher shop of the anzique cannibals a small red spattering glistened picturesquely , lending vividness to the horror of the engraving .
the old man saw it , and stopped whispering even before my expression of horror made it necessary ; saw it and glanced quickly toward the floor of the room he had left an hour before .
i followed his glance , and beheld just above us on the loose plaster of the ancient ceiling a large irregular spot of wet crimson which seemed to spread even as i viewed it .
i did not shriek or move , but merely shut my eyes .
a moment later came the titanic thunderbolt of thunderbolts ; blasting that accursed house of unutterable secrets and bringing the oblivion which alone saved my mind .
i am iranon , and come from aira , a far city that i recall only dimly but seek to find again .
i am a singer of songs that i learned in the far city , and my calling is to make beauty with the things remembered of childhood .
my wealth is in little memories and dreams , and in hopes that i sing in gardens when the moon is tender and the west wind stirs the .
when the men of teloth heard these things they whispered to one another ; for though in the granite city there is no laughter or song , the stern men sometimes look to the karthian hills in the spring and think of the lutes of distant oonai whereof travellers have told .
and thinking thus , they bade the stranger stay and sing in the square before the tower of mlin , though they liked not the colour of his tattered robe , nor the myrrh in his hair , nor his chaplet of , nor the youth in his golden voice .
at evening iranon sang , and while he sang an old man prayed and a blind man said he saw a nimbus over the singer head .
but most of the men of teloth yawned , and some laughed and some went to sleep ; for iranon told nothing useful , singing only his memories , his dreams , and his hopes .
i remember the twilight , the moon , and soft songs , and the window where i was rocked to sleep .
and through the window was the street where the golden lights came , and where the shadows danced on houses of marble .
i remember the square of moonlight on the floor , that was not like any other light , and the visions that danced on the moonbeams when my mother sang to me .
and too , i remember the sun of morning bright above the hills in summer , and the sweetness of flowers borne on the south wind that made the trees sing .
oh aira , city of marble and beryl , how many are thy beauties !
how i loved the warm and fragrant groves across the hyaline nithra , and the falls of the tiny kra that flowed though the verdant valley !
in those groves and in the vale the children wove wreathes for one another , and at dusk i dreamed strange dreams under the on the mountain as i saw below me the lights of the city , and the curving nithra reflecting a ribbon of stars .
and in the city were the palaces of veined and tinted marble , with golden domes and painted walls , and green gardens with cerulean pools and crystal fountains .
often i played in the gardens and waded in the pools , and lay and dreamed among the pale flowers under the trees .
and sometimes at sunset i would climb the long hilly street to the citadel and the open place , and look down upon aira , the magic city of marble and beryl , splendid in a robe of golden flame .
long have i missed thee , aira , for i was but young when we went into exile ; but my father was thy king and i shall come again to thee , for it is so decreed of fate .
all through seven lands have i sought thee , and some day shall i reign over thy groves and gardens , thy streets and palaces , and sing to men who shall know whereof i sing , and laugh not nor turn away .
for i am iranon , who was a prince in aira .
that night the men of teloth lodged the stranger in a stable , and in the morning an archon came to him and told him to go to the shop of athok the cobbler , and be apprenticed to him .
but i am iranon , a singer of songs , he said , and have no heart for the cobbler trade .
all in teloth must toil , replied the archon , for that is the law .
then said iranon wherefore do ye toil ; is it not that ye may live and be happy ?
and if ye toil only that ye may toil more , when shall happiness find you ?
ye toil to live , but is not life made of beauty and song ?
and if ye suffer no singers among you , where shall be the fruits of your toil ?
toil without song is like a weary journey without an end .
were not death more pleasing ?
but the archon was sullen and did not understand , and rebuked the stranger .
thou art a strange youth , and i like not thy face or thy voice .
the words thou speakest are blasphemy , for the gods of teloth have said that toil is good .
our gods have promised us a haven of light beyond death , where shall be rest without end , and crystal coldness amidst which none shall vex his mind with thought or his eyes with beauty .
go thou then to athok the cobbler or be gone out of the city by sunset .
all here must serve , and song is folly .
so iranon went out of the stable and walked over the narrow stone streets between the gloomy square house of granite , seeking something green , for all was of stone .
on the faces of men were frowns , but by the stone embankment along the sluggish river zuro sat a young boy with sad eyes gazing into the waters to spy green budding branches washed down from the hills by the freshets .
and the boy said to him art thou not indeed he of whom the archons tell , who seekest a far city in a fair land ?
i am romnod , and borne of the blood of teloth , but am not old in the ways of the granite city , and yearn daily for the warm groves and the distant lands of beauty and song .
beyond the karthian hills lieth oonai , the city of lutes and dancing , which men whisper of and say is both lovely and would i go were i old enough to find the way , and thither shouldst thou go and thou wouldst sing and have men listen to thee .
let us leave the city of teloth and fare together among the hills of spring .
thou shalt shew me the ways of travel and i will attend thy songs at evening when the stars one by one bring dreams to the minds of dreamers .
and peradventure it may be that oonai the city of lutes and dancing is even the fair aira thou seekest , for it is told that thou hast not known aira since the old days , and a name often changeth .
let us go to oonai , o iranon of the golden head , where men shall know our longings and welcome us as brothers , nor even laugh or frown at what we say .
and iranon answered be it so , small one ; if any in this stone place yearn for beauty he must seek the mountains and beyond , and i would not leave thee to pine by the sluggish zuro .
but think not that delight and understanding dwell just across the karthian hills , or in any spot thou canst find in a day , or a year , or a lustrum journey .
behold , when i was small like thee i dwelt in the valley of narthos by the frigid xari , where none would listen to my dreams ; and i told myself that when older i would go to sinara on the southern slope , and sing to smiling in the marketplace .
but when i went to sinara i found the all drunken and ribald , and saw that their songs were not as mine , so i travelled in a barge down the xari to onyx walled jaren .
and the soldiers at jaren laughed at me and drave me out , so that i wandered to many cities .
i have seen stethelos that is below the great cataract , and have gazed on the marsh where sarnath once stood .
i have been to thraa , ilarnek , and kadatheron on the winding river ai , and have dwelt long in olathoe in the land of lomar .
but though i have had listeners sometimes , they have ever been few .
and i know that welcome shall wait me only in aira , the city of marble and beryl where my father once ruled as king .
so for aira shall we seek , though it were well to visit distant and oonai across the karthian hills , which may indeed be aira , though i think not .
aira beauty is past imagining , and none can tell of it without rapture , whilst of oonai the whisper leeringly .
at the sunset iranon and small romnod went forth from teloth , and for long wandered amidst the green hills and cool forests .
the way was rough and obscure , and never did they seem nearer to oonai the city of lutes and dancing ; but in the dusk as the stars came out iranon would sing of aira and its beauties and romnod would listen , so that they were both happy after a fashion .
they ate plentifully of fruit and red berries , and marked not the passing of time , but many years must have slipped away .
small romnod was now not so small , and spoke deeply instead of shrilly , though iranon was always the same , and decked his golden hair with vines and fragrant resins found in the woods .
so it came to pass that romnod seemed older than iranon , though he had been very small when iranon had found him watching for green budding branches in teloth beside the sluggish zuro .
then one night when the moon was full the travellers came to a mountain crest and looked down upon the myriad light of oonai .
peasants had told them they were near , and iranon knew that this was not his native city of aira .
the lights of oonai were not like those of aira ; for they were harsh and glaring , while the lights of aira shine as softly and magically as shone the moonlight on the floor by the window where iranon mother once rocked him to sleep with song .
but oonai was a city of lutes and dancing , so iranon and romnod went down the steep slope that they might find men to whom sings and dreams would bring pleasure .
and when they were come into the town they found revellers bound from house to house and leaning from windows and balconies , who listened to the songs of iranon and tossed him flowers and applauded when he was done .
then for a moment did iranon believe he had found those who thought and felt even as he , though the town was not a hundredth as fair as aira .
when dawn came iranon looked about with dismay , for the domes of oonai were not golden in the sun , but grey and dismal .
and the men of oonai were pale with revelling , and dull with wine , and unlike the radient men of aira .
but because the people had thrown him blossoms and acclaimed his sings iranon stayed on , and with him romnod , who liked the revelry of the town and wore in his dark hair roses and myrtle .
often at night iranon sang to the revellers , but he was always as before , crowned only in the vine of the mountains and remembering the marble streets of aira and the hyaline nithra .
in the frescoed halls of the monarch did he sing , upon a crystal dais raised over a floor that was a mirror , and as he sang , he brought pictures to his hearers till the floor seemed to reflect old , beautiful , and things instead of the feasters who pelted him with roses .
and the king bade him put away his tattered purple , and clothed him in satin and , with rings of green jade and bracelets of tinted ivory , and lodged him in a gilded and tapestried chamber on a bed of sweet carven wood with canopies and coverlets of flower embroidered silk .
thus dwelt iranon in oonai , the city of lutes and dancing .
it is not known how long iranon tarried in oonai , but one day the king brought to the palace some wild whirling dancers from the liranian desert , and dusky from drinen in the east , and after that the revellers threw their roses not so much at iranon as at the dancers and .
and day by day that romnod who had been a small boy in granite teloth grew coarser and redder with wine , till he dreamed less and less , and listened with less delight to the songs of iranon .
but though iranon was sad he ceased not to sing , and at evening told again of his dreams of aira , the city of marble and beryl .
then one night the reddened and fattened romnod snorted heavily amidst the poppied silks of his and died writhing , whilst iranon , pale and slender , sang to himself in a far corner .
and when iranon had wept over the grave of romnod and strewn it with green branches , such as romnod used to love , he put aside his silks and gauds and went forgotten out of oonai the city of lutes and dancing clad only in the ragged purple in which he had come , and garlanded with fresh vines from the mountains .
into the sunset wandered iranon , seeking still for his native land and for men who would understand his songs and dreams .
in all the cities of cydathria and in the lands beyond the bnazie desert children laughed at his olden songs and tattered robe of purple ; but iranon stayed ever young , and wore wreathes upon his golden head whilst he sang of aira , delight of the past and hope of the future .
so came he one night to the squallid cot of an antique shepherd , bent and dirty , who kept flocks on a stony slope above a quicksand marsh .
to this man iranon spoke , as to so many others canst thou tell me where i may find aira , the city of marble and beryl , where flows the hyaline nithra and where the falls of the tiny kra sing to the verdant valleys and hills forested with yath trees ?
and the shepherd , hearing , looked long and strangely at iranon , as if recalling something very far away in time , and noted each line of the stranger face , and his golden hair , and his crown of .
but he was old , and shook his head as he replied o stranger , i have indeed heard the name of aira , and the other names thou hast spoken , but they come to me from afar down the waste of long years .
i heard them in my youth from the lips of a playmate , a beggar boy given to strange dreams , who would weave long tales about the moon and the flowers and the west wind .
we used to laugh at him , for we knew him from his birth though he thought himself a king son .
he was comely , even as thou , but full of folly and strangeness ; and he ran away when small to find those who would listen gladly to his songs and dreams .
how often hath he sung to me of lands that never were , and things that never can be !
of aira did he speak much ; of aira and the river nithra , and the falls of the tiny kra .
there would he ever say he once dwelt as a prince , though here we knew him from his birth .
nor was there ever a marble city of aira , or those who could delight in strange songs , save in the dreams of mine old playmate iranon who is gone .
and in the twilight , as the stars came out one by one and the moon cast on the marsh a radiance like that which a child sees quivering on the floor as he is rocked to sleep at evening , there walked into the lethal quicksands a very old man in tattered purple , crowned with withered and gazing ahead as if upon the golden domes of a fair city where dreams are understood .
that night something of youth and beauty died in the elder world .
on july , i moved into exham priory after the last workman had finished his labours .
the restoration had been a stupendous task , for little had remained of the deserted pile but a ruin ; yet because it had been the seat of my ancestors , i let no expense deter me .
the place had not been inhabited since the reign of james the first , when a tragedy of intensely hideous , though largely unexplained , nature had struck down the master , five of his children , and several servants ; and driven forth under a cloud of suspicion and terror the third son , my lineal progenitor and the only survivor of the abhorred line .
with this sole heir denounced as a murderer , the estate had reverted to the crown , nor had the accused man made any attempt to exculpate himself or regain his property .
shaken by some horror greater than that of conscience or the law , and expressing only a frantic wish to exclude the ancient edifice from his sight and memory , walter de la poer , eleventh baron exham , fled to virginia and there founded the family which by the next century had become known as delapore .
exham priory had remained untenanted , though later allotted to the estates of the norrys family and much studied because of its peculiarly composite architecture ; an architecture involving gothic towers resting on a saxon or romanesque substructure , whose foundation in turn was of a still earlier order or blend of orders roman , and even druidic or native cymric , if legends speak truly .
this foundation was a very singular thing , being merged on one side with the solid limestone of the precipice from whose brink the priory overlooked a desolate valley three miles west of the village of anchester .
architects and antiquarians loved to examine this strange relic of forgotten centuries , but the country folk hated it .
they had hated it hundreds of years before , when my ancestors lived there , and they hated it now , with the moss and mould of abandonment on it .
i had not been a day in anchester before i knew i came of an accursed house .
and this week workmen have blown up exham priory , and are busy obliterating the traces of its foundations .
the bare statistics of my ancestry i had always known , together with the fact that my first american forebear had come to the colonies under a strange cloud .
of details , however , i had been kept wholly ignorant through the policy of reticence always maintained by the delapores .
unlike our planter neighbours , we seldom boasted of crusading ancestors or other mediaeval and renaissance heroes ; nor was any kind of tradition handed down except what may have been recorded in the sealed envelope left before the civil war by every squire to his eldest son for posthumous opening .
the glories we cherished were those achieved since the migration ; the glories of a proud and honourable , if somewhat reserved and unsocial virginia line .
during the war our fortunes were extinguished and our whole existence changed by the burning of carfax , our home on the banks of the james .
my grandfather , advanced in years , had perished in that incendiary outrage , and with him the envelope that had bound us all to the past .
i can recall that fire today as i saw it then at the age of seven , with the federal soldiers shouting , the women screaming , and the negroes howling and praying .
my father was in the army , defending richmond , and after many formalities my mother and i were passed through the lines to join him .
when the war ended we all moved north , whence my mother had come ; and i grew to manhood , middle age , and ultimate wealth as a stolid yankee .
neither my father nor i ever knew what our hereditary envelope had contained , and as i merged into the greyness of massachusetts business life i lost all interest in the mysteries which evidently lurked far back in my family tree .
had i suspected their nature , how gladly i would have left exham priory to its moss , bats and cobwebs !
my father died in , but without any message to leave to me , or to my only child , alfred , a motherless boy of ten .
it was this boy who reversed the order of family information , for although i could give him only jesting conjectures about the past , he wrote me of some very interesting ancestral legends when the late war took him to england in as an aviation officer .
apparently the delapores had a colourful and perhaps sinister history , for a friend of my son , capt .
edward norrys of the royal flying corps , dwelt near the family seat at anchester and related some peasant superstitions which few novelists could equal for wildness and incredibility .
norrys himself , of course , did not take them so seriously ; but they amused my son and made good material for his letters to me .
it was this legendry which definitely turned my attention to my transatlantic heritage , and made me resolve to purchase and restore the family seat which norrys showed to alfred in its picturesque desertion , and offered to get for him at a surprisingly reasonable figure , since his own uncle was the present owner .
i bought exham priory in , but was almost immediately distracted from my plans of restoration by the return of my son as a maimed invalid .
during the two years that he lived i thought of nothing but his care , having even placed my business under the direction of partners .
in , as i found myself bereaved and aimless , a retired manufacturer no longer young , i resolved to divert my remaining years with my new possession .
visiting anchester in december , i was entertained by capt .
norrys , a plump , amiable young man who had thought much of my son , and secured his assistance in gathering plans and anecdotes to guide in the coming restoration .
exham priory itself i saw without emotion , a jumble of tottering mediaeval ruins covered with lichens and honeycombed with rooks ' nests , perched perilously upon a precipice , and denuded of floors or other interior features save the stone walls of the separate towers .
as i gradually recovered the image of the edifice as it had been when my ancestors left it over three centuries before , i began to hire workmen for the reconstruction .
in every case i was forced to go outside the immediate locality , for the anchester villagers had an almost unbelievable fear and hatred of the place .
the sentiment was so great that it was sometimes communicated to the outside labourers , causing numerous desertions ; whilst its scope appeared to include both the priory and its ancient family .
my son had told me that he was somewhat avoided during his visits because he was a de la poer , and i now found myself subtly ostracized for a like reason until i convinced the peasants how little i knew of my heritage .
even then they sullenly disliked me , so that i had to collect most of the village traditions through the mediation of norrys .
what the people could not forgive , perhaps , was that i had come to restore a symbol so abhorrent to them ; for , rationally or not , they viewed exham priory as nothing less than a haunt of fiends and werewolves .
piecing together the tales which norrys collected for me , and supplementing them with the accounts of several savants who had studied the ruins , i deduced that exham priory stood on the site of a prehistoric temple ; a druidical or thing which must have been contemporary with stonehenge .
that indescribable rites had been celebrated there , few doubted , and there were unpleasant tales of the transference of these rites into the cybele worship which the romans had introduced .
inscriptions still visible in the bore such unmistakable letters as .
' , sign of the magna mater whose dark worship was once vainly forbidden to roman citizens .
anchester had been the camp of the third augustan legion , as many remains attest , and it was said that the temple of cybele was splendid and thronged with worshippers who performed nameless ceremonies at the bidding of a phrygian priest .
tales added that the fall of the old religion did not end the orgies at the temple , but that the priests lived on in the new faith without real change .
likewise was it said that the rites did not vanish with the roman power , and that certain among the saxons added to what remained of the temple , and gave it the essential outline it subsequently preserved , making it the centre of a cult feared through half the heptarchy .
about the place is mentioned in a chronicle as being a substantial stone priory housing a strange and powerful monastic order and surrounded by extensive gardens which needed no walls to exclude a frightened populace .
it was never destroyed by the danes , though after the norman conquest it must have declined tremendously , since there was no impediment when henry the third granted the site to my ancestor , gilbert de la poer , first baron exham , in .
of my family before this date there is no evil report , but something strange must have happened then .
in one chronicle there is a reference to a de la poer as cursed of god in , whilst village legendry had nothing but evil and frantic fear to tell of the castle that went up on the foundations of the old temple and priory .
the fireside tales were of the most grisly description , all the ghastlier because of their frightened reticence and cloudy evasiveness .
they represented my ancestors as a race of hereditary daemons beside whom gilles de retz and the marquis de sade would seem the veriest tyros , and hinted whisperingly at their responsibility for the occasional disappearances of villagers through several generations .
the worst characters , apparently , were the barons and their direct heirs ; at least , most was whispered about these .
if of healthier inclinations , it was said , an heir would early and mysteriously die to make way for another more typical scion .
there seemed to be an inner cult in the family , presided over by the head of the house , and sometimes closed except to a few members .
temperament rather than ancestry was evidently the basis of this cult , for it was entered by several who married into the family .
lady margaret trevor from cornwall , wife of godfrey , the second son of the fifth baron , became a favourite bane of children all over the countryside , and the daemon heroine of a particularly horrible old ballad not yet extinct near the welsh border .
preserved in balladry , too , though not illustrating the same point , is the hideous tale of lady mary de la poer , who shortly after her marriage to the earl of shrewsfield was killed by him and his mother , both of the slayers being absolved and blessed by the priest to whom they confessed what they dared not repeat to the world .
these myths and ballads , typical as they were of crude superstition , repelled me greatly .
their persistence , and their application to so long a line of my ancestors , were especially annoying ; whilst the imputations of monstrous habits proved unpleasantly reminiscent of the one known scandal of my immediate forebears the case of my cousin , young randolph delapore of carfax who went among the negroes and became a voodoo priest after he returned from the mexican war .
i was much less disturbed by the vaguer tales of wails and howlings in the barren , windswept valley beneath the limestone cliff ; of the graveyard stenches after the spring rains ; of the floundering , squealing white thing on which sir john clave horse had trod one night in a lonely field ; and of the servant who had gone mad at what he saw in the priory in the full light of day .
these things were hackneyed spectral lore , and i was at that time a pronounced sceptic .
the accounts of vanished peasants were less to be dismissed , though not especially significant in view of mediaeval custom .
prying curiosity meant death , and more than one severed head had been publicly shown on the bastions now effaced around exham priory .
a few of the tales were exceedingly picturesque , and made me wish i had learnt more of the comparative mythology in my youth .
there was , for instance , the belief that a legion of devils kept witches ' sabbath each night at the priory a legion whose sustenance might explain the disproportionate abundance of coarse vegetables harvested in the vast gardens .
and , most vivid of all , there was the dramatic epic of the rats the scampering army of obscene vermin which had burst forth from the castle three months after the tragedy that doomed it to desertion the lean , filthy , ravenous army which had swept all before it and devoured fowl , cats , dogs , hogs , sheep , and even two hapless human beings before its fury was spent .
around that unforgettable rodent army a whole separate cycle of myths revolves , for it scattered among the village homes and brought curses and horrors in its train .
such was the lore that assailed me as i pushed to completion , with an elderly obstinacy , the work of restoring my ancestral home .
it must not be imagined for a moment that these tales formed my principal psychological environment .
on the other hand , i was constantly praised and encouraged by capt .
norrys and the antiquarians who surrounded and aided me .
when the task was done , over two years after its commencement , i viewed the great rooms , wainscoted walls , vaulted ceilings , mullioned windows , and broad staircases with a pride which fully compensated for the prodigious expense of the restoration .
every attribute of the middle ages was cunningly reproduced and the new parts blended perfectly with the original walls and foundations .
the seat of my fathers was complete , and i looked forward to redeeming at last the local fame of the line which ended in me .
i could reside here permanently , and prove that a de la poer ( for i had adopted again the original spelling of the name ) need not be a fiend .
my comfort was perhaps augmented by the fact that , although exham priory was mediaevally fitted , its interior was in truth wholly new and free from old vermin and old ghosts alike .
as i have said , i moved in on july .
my household consisted of seven servants and nine cats , of which latter species i am particularly fond .
my eldest cat , , was seven years old and had come with me from my home in bolton , massachusetts ; the others i had accumulated whilst living with capt .
norrys ' family during the restoration of the priory .
for five days our routine proceeded with the utmost placidity , my time being spent mostly in the codification of old family data .
i had now obtained some very circumstantial accounts of the final tragedy and flight of walter de la poer , which i conceived to be the probable contents of the hereditary paper lost in the fire at carfax .
it appeared that my ancestor was accused with much reason of having killed all the other members of his household , except four servant confederates , in their sleep , about two weeks after a shocking discovery which changed his whole demeanour , but which , except by implication , he disclosed to no one save perhaps the servants who assisted him and afterwards fled beyond reach .
this deliberate slaughter , which included a father , three brothers , and two sisters , was largely condoned by the villagers , and so slackly treated by the law that its perpetrator escaped honoured , unharmed , and undisguised to virginia ; the general whispered sentiment being that he had purged the land of an immemorial curse .
what discovery had prompted an act so terrible , i could scarcely even conjecture .
walter de la poer must have known for years the sinister tales about his family , so that this material could have given him no fresh impulse .
had he , then , witnessed some appalling ancient rite , or stumbled upon some frightful and revealing symbol in the priory or its vicinity ?
he was reputed to have been a shy , gentle youth in england .
in virginia he seemed not so much hard or bitter as harassed and apprehensive .
he was spoken of in the diary of another gentleman adventurer , francis harley of bellview , as a man of unexampled justice , honour , and delicacy .
on july occurred the first incident which , though lightly dismissed at the time , takes on a preternatural significance in relation to later events .
it was so simple as to be almost negligible , and could not possibly have been noticed under the circumstances ; for it must be recalled that since i was in a building practically fresh and new except for the walls , and surrounded by a staff of servitors , apprehension would have been absurd despite the locality .
what i afterward remembered is merely this that my old black cat , whose moods i know so well , was undoubtedly alert and anxious to an extent wholly out of keeping with his natural character .
he roved from room to room , restless and disturbed , and sniffed constantly about the walls which formed part of the gothic structure .
i realize how trite this sounds like the inevitable dog in the ghost story , which always growls before his master sees the sheeted figure yet i can not consistently suppress it .
the following day a servant complained of restlessness among all the cats in the house .
he came to me in my study , a lofty west room on the second storey , with groined arches , black oak panelling , and a triple gothic window overlooking the limestone cliff and desolate valley ; and even as he spoke i saw the jetty form of creeping along the west wall and scratching at the new panels which overlaid the ancient stone .
i told the man that there must be a singular odour or emanation from the old stonework , imperceptible to human senses , but affecting the delicate organs of cats even through the new woodwork .
this i truly believed , and when the fellow suggested the presence of mice or rats , i mentioned that there had been no rats there for three hundred years , and that even the field mice of the surrounding country could hardly be found in these high walls , where they had never been known to stray .
that afternoon i called on capt .
norrys , and he assured me that it would be quite incredible for field mice to infest the priory in such a sudden and unprecedented fashion .
that night , dispensing as usual with a valet , i retired in the west tower chamber which i had chosen as my own , reached from the study by a stone staircase and short gallery the former partly ancient , the latter entirely restored .
this room was circular , very high , and without wainscoting , being hung with arras which i had myself chosen in london .
seeing that was with me , i shut the heavy gothic door and retired by the light of the electric bulbs which so cleverly counterfeited candles , finally switching off the light and sinking on the carved and canopied , with the venerable cat in his accustomed place across my feet .
i did not draw the curtains , but gazed out at the narrow window which i faced .
there was a suspicion of aurora in the sky , and the delicate traceries of the window were pleasantly silhouetted .
at some time i must have fallen quietly asleep , for i recall a distinct sense of leaving strange dreams , when the cat started violently from his placid position .
i saw him in the faint auroral glow , head strained forward , fore feet on my ankles , and hind feet stretched behind .
he was looking intensely at a point on the wall somewhat west of the window , a point which to my eye had nothing to mark it , but toward which all my attention was now directed .
and as i watched , i knew that was not vainly excited .
whether the arras actually moved i can not say .
i think it did , very slightly .
but what i can swear to is that behind it i heard a low , distinct scurrying as of rats or mice .
in a moment the cat had jumped bodily on the screening tapestry , bringing the affected section to the floor with his weight , and exposing a damp , ancient wall of stone ; patched here and there by the restorers , and devoid of any trace of rodent prowlers .
raced up and down the floor by this part of the wall , clawing the fallen arras and seemingly trying at times to insert a paw between the wall and the oaken floor .
he found nothing , and after a time returned wearily to his place across my feet .
i had not moved , but i did not sleep again that night .
in the morning i questioned all the servants , and found that none of them had noticed anything unusual , save that the cook remembered the actions of a cat which had rested on her windowsill .
this cat had howled at some unknown hour of the night , awaking the cook in time for her to see him dart purposefully out of the open door down the stairs .
i drowsed away the noontime , and in the afternoon called again on capt .
norrys , who became exceedingly interested in what i told him .
the odd incidents so slight yet so curious appealed to his sense of the picturesque and elicited from him a number of reminiscenses of local ghostly lore .
we were genuinely perplexed at the presence of rats , and norrys lent me some traps and paris green , which i had the servants place in strategic localities when i returned .
i retired early , being very sleepy , but was harassed by dreams of the most horrible sort .
i seemed to be looking down from an immense height upon a twilit grotto , with filth , where a daemon swineherd drove about with his staff a flock of fungous , flabby beasts whose appearance filled me with unutterable loathing .
then , as the swineherd paused and nodded over his task , a mighty swarm of rats rained down on the stinking abyss and fell to devouring beasts and man alike .
from this terrific vision i was abruptly awakened by the motions of , who had been sleeping as usual across my feet .
this time i did not have to question the source of his snarls and hisses , and of the fear which made him sink his claws into my ankle , unconscious of their effect ; for on every side of the chamber the walls were alive with nauseous sound the veminous slithering of ravenous , gigantic rats .
there was now no aurora to show the state of the arras the fallen section of which had been replaced but i was not too frightened to switch on the light .
as the bulbs leapt into radiance i saw a hideous shaking all over the tapestry , causing the somewhat peculiar designs to execute a singular dance of death .
this motion disappeared almost at once , and the sound with it .
springing out of bed , i poked at the arras with the long handle of a that rested near , and lifted one section to see what lay beneath .
there was nothing but the patched stone wall , and even the cat had lost his tense realization of abnormal presences .
when i examined the circular trap that had been placed in the room , i found all of the openings sprung , though no trace remained of what had been caught and had escaped .
further sleep was out of the question , so lighting a candle , i opened the door and went out in the gallery towards the stairs to my study , following at my heels .
before we had reached the stone steps , however , the cat darted ahead of me and vanished down the ancient flight .
as i descended the stairs myself , i became suddenly aware of sounds in the great room below ; sounds of a nature which could not be mistaken .
the walls were alive with rats , scampering and milling whilst was racing about with the fury of a baffled hunter .
reaching the bottom , i switched on the light , which did not this time cause the noise to subside .
the rats continued their riot , stampeding with such force and distinctness that i could finally assign to their motions a definite direction .
these creatures , in numbers apparently inexhaustible , were engaged in one stupendous migration from inconceivable heights to some depth conceivably or inconceivably below .
i now heard steps in the corridor , and in another moment two servants pushed open the massive door .
they were searching the house for some unknown source of disturbance which had thrown all the cats into a snarling panic and caused them to plunge precipitately down several flights of stairs and squat , yowling , before the closed door to the .
i asked them if they had heard the rats , but they replied in the negative .
and when i turned to call their attention to the sounds in the panels , i realized that the noise had ceased .
with the two men , i went down to the door of the , but found the cats already dispersed .
later i resolved to explore the crypt below , but for the present i merely made a round of the traps .
all were sprung , yet all were tenantless .
satisfying myself that no one had heard the rats save the felines and me , i sat in my study till morning , thinking profoundly and recalling every scrap of legend i had unearthed concerning the building i inhabited .
i slept some in the forenoon , leaning back in the one comfortable library chair which my mediaeval plan of furnishing could not banish .
later i telephoned to capt .
norrys , who came over and helped me explore the .
absolutely nothing untoward was found , although we could not repress a thrill at the knowledge that this vault was built by roman hands .
every low arch and massive pillar was roman not the debased romanesque of the bungling saxons , but the severe and harmonious classicism of the age of the caesars ; indeed , the walls abounded with inscriptions familiar to the antiquarians who had repeatedly explored the place things like .
and the reference to atys made me shiver , for i had read catullus and knew something of the hideous rites of the eastern god , whose worship was so mixed with that of cybele .
norrys and i , by the light of lanterns , tried to interpret the odd and nearly effaced designs on certain irregularly rectangular blocks of stone generally held to be altars , but could make nothing of them .
we remembered that one pattern , a sort of rayed sun , was held by students to imply a origin suggesting that these altars had merely been adopted by the roman priests from some older and perhaps aboriginal temple on the same site .
on one of these blocks were some brown stains which made me wonder .
the largest , in the centre of the room , had certain features on the upper surface which indicated its connection with fire probably burnt offerings .
such were the sights in that crypt before whose door the cats howled , and where norrys and i now determined to pass the night .
couches were brought down by the servants , who were told not to mind any nocturnal actions of the cats , and was admitted as much for help as for companionship .
we decided to keep the great oak door a modern replica with slits for ventilation tightly closed ; and , with this attended to , we retired with lanterns still burning to await whatever might occur .
the vault was very deep in the foundations of the priory , and undoubtedly far down on the face of the beetling limestone cliff overlooking the waste valley .
that it had been the goal of the scuffling and unexplainable rats i could not doubt , though why , i could not tell .
as we lay there expectantly , i found my vigil occasionally mixed with dreams from which the uneasy motions of the cat across my feet would rouse me .
these dreams were not wholesome , but horribly like the one i had had the night before .
i saw again the twilit grotto , and the swineherd with his unmentionable fungous beasts wallowing in filth , and as i looked at these things they seemed nearer and more distinct so distinct that i could almost observe their features .
then i did observe the flabby features of one of them and awakened with such a scream that started up , whilst capt .
norrys , who had not slept , laughed considerably .
norrys might have laughed more or perhaps less had he known what it was that made me scream .
but i did not remember myself till later .
ultimate horror often paralyses memory in a merciful way .
norrys waked me when the phenomena began .
out of the same frightful dream i was called by his gentle shaking and his urging to listen to the cats .
indeed , there was much to listen to , for beyond the closed door at the head of the stone steps was a veritable nightmare of feline yelling and clawing , whilst , unmindful of his kindred outside , was running excitedly round the bare stone walls , in which i heard the same babel of scurrying rats that had troubled me the night before .
an acute terror now rose within me , for here were anomalies which nothing normal could well explain .
these rats , if not the creatures of a madness which i shared with the cats alone , must be burrowing and sliding in roman walls i had thought to be solid limestone blocks unless perhaps the action of water through more than seventeen centuries had eaten winding tunnels which rodent bodies had worn clear and ample but even so , the spectral horror was no less ; for if these were living vermin why did not norrys hear their disgusting commotion ?
why did he urge me to watch and listen to the cats outside , and why did he guess wildly and vaguely at what could have aroused them ?
by the time i had managed to tell him , as rationally as i could , what i thought i was hearing , my ears gave me the last fading impression of scurrying ; which had retreated still downward , far underneath this deepest of till it seemed as if the whole cliff below were riddled with questing rats .
norrys was not as sceptical as i had anticipated , but instead seemed profoundly moved .
he motioned to me to notice that the cats at the door had ceased their clamour , as if giving up the rats for lost ; whilst had a burst of renewed restlessness , and was clawing frantically around the bottom of the large stone altar in the centre of the room , which was nearer norrys ' couch than mine .
my fear of the unknown was at this point very great .
something astounding had occurred , and i saw that capt .
norrys , a younger , stouter , and presumably more naturally materialistic man , was affected fully as much as myself perhaps because of his lifelong and intimate familiarity with local legend .
we could for the moment do nothing but watch the old black cat as he pawed with decreasing fervour at the base of the altar , occasionally looking up and mewing to me in that persuasive manner which he used when he wished me to perform some favour for him .
norrys now took a lantern close to the altar and examined the place where was pawing ; silently kneeling and scraping away the lichens of the centuries which joined the massive block to the tessellated floor .
he did not find anything , and was about to abandon his efforts when i noticed a trivial circumstance which made me shudder , even though it implied nothing more than i had already imagined .
i told him of it , and we both looked at its almost imperceptible manifestation with the fixedness of fascinated discovery and acknowledgment .
it was only this that the flame of the lantern set down near the altar was slightly but certainly flickering from a draught of air which it had not before received , and which came indubitably from the crevice between floor and altar where norrys was scraping away the lichens .
we spent the rest of the night in the study , nervously discussing what we should do next .
the discovery that some vault deeper than the deepest known masonry of the romans underlay this accursed pile , some vault unsuspected by the curious antiquarians of three centuries , would have been sufficient to excite us without any background of the sinister .
as it was , the fascination became two fold ; and we paused in doubt whether to abandon our search and quit the priory forever in superstitious caution , or to gratify our sense of adventure and brave whatever horrors might await us in the unknown depths .
by morning we had compromised , and decided to go to london to gather a group of archaeologists and scientific men fit to cope with the mystery .
it should be mentioned that before leaving the we had vainly tried to move the central altar which we now recognized as the gate to a new pit of nameless fear .
what secret would open the gate , wiser men than we would have to find .
during many days in london capt .
norrys and i presented our facts , conjectures , and legendary anecdotes to five eminent authorities , all men who could be trusted to respect any family disclosures which future explorations might develop .
we found most of them little disposed to scoff but , instead , intensely interested and sincerely sympathetic .
it is hardly necessary to name them all , but i may say that they included sir william brinton , whose excavations in the troad excited most of the world in their day .
as we all took the train for anchester i felt myself poised on the brink of frightful revelations , a sensation symbolized by the air of mourning among the many americans at the unexpected death of the president on the other side of the world .
on the evening of august we reached exham priory , where the servants assured me that nothing unusual had occurred .
the cats , even old , had been perfectly placid , and not a trap in the house had been sprung .
we were to begin exploring on the following day , awaiting which i assigned rooms to all my guests .
i myself retired in my own tower chamber , with across my feet .
sleep came quickly , but hideous dreams assailed me .
there was a vision of a roman feast like that of trimalchio , with a horror in a covered platter .
then came that damnable , recurrent thing about the swineherd and his filthy drove in the twilit grotto .
yet when i awoke it was full daylight , with normal sounds in the house below .
the rats , living or spectral , had not troubled me ; and was still quietly asleep .
on going down , i found that the same tranquillity had prevailed elsewhere ; a condition which one of the assembled servants a fellow named thornton , devoted to the psychic rather absurdly laid to the fact that i had now been shown the thing which certain forces had wished to show me .
all was now ready , and at our entire group of seven men , bearing powerful electric searchlights and implements of excavation , went down to the and bolted the door behind us .
was with us , for the investigators found no occasion to despise his excitability , and were indeed anxious that he be present in case of obscure rodent manifestations .
we noted the roman inscriptions and unknown altar designs only briefly , for three of the savants had already seen them , and all knew their characteristics .
prime attention was paid to the momentous central altar , and within an hour sir william brinton had caused it to tilt backward , balanced by some unknown species of counterweight .
there now lay revealed such a horror as would have overwhelmed us had we not been prepared .
through a nearly square opening in the tiled floor , sprawling on a flight of stone steps so prodigiously worn that it was little more than an inclined plane at the centre , was a ghastly array of human or bones .
those which retained their collocation as skeletons showed attitudes of panic fear , and over all were the marks of rodent gnawing .
the skulls denoted nothing short of utter idiocy , cretinism , or primitive .
above the hellishly littered steps arched a descending passage seemingly chiselled from the solid rock , and conducting a current of air .
this current was not a sudden and noxious rush as from a closed vault , but a cool breeze with something of freshness in it .
we did not pause long , but shiveringly began to clear a passage down the steps .
it was then that sir william , examining the hewn walls , made the odd observation that the passage , according to the direction of the strokes , must have been chiselled from beneath .
i must be very deliberate now , and choose my words .
after ploughing down a few steps amidst the gnawled bones we saw that there was light ahead ; not any mystic phosphorescence , but a filtered daylight which could not come except from unknown fissures in the cliff that over looked the waste valley .
that such fissures had escaped notice from outside was hardly remarkable , for not only is the valley wholly uninhabited , but the cliff is so high and beetling that only an aeronaut could study its face in detail .
a few steps more , and our breaths were literally snatched from us by what we saw ; so literally that thornton , the psychic investigator , actually fainted in the arms of the dazed men who stood behind him .
norrys , his plump face utterly white and flabby , simply cried out inarticulately ; whilst i think that what i did was to gasp or hiss , and cover my eyes .
the man behind me the only one of the party older than i croaked the hackneyed my god !
in the most cracked voice i ever heard .
of seven cultivated men , only sir william brinton retained his composure , a thing the more to his credit because he led the party and must have seen the sight first .
it was a twilit grotto of enormous height , stretching away farther than any eye could see ; a subterraneous world of limitless mystery and horrible suggestion .
there were buildings and other architectural remains in one terrified glance i saw a weird pattern of tumuli , a savage circle of monoliths , a roman ruin , a sprawling saxon pile , and an early english edifice of wood but all these were dwarfed by the ghoulish spectacle presented by the general surface of the ground .
for yards about the steps extended an insane tangle of human bones , or bones at least as human as those on the steps .
like a foamy sea they stretched , some fallen apart , but others wholly or partly articulated as skeletons ; these latter invariably in postures of daemoniac frenzy , either fighting off some menace or clutching other forms with cannibal intent .
when dr trask , the anthropologist , stopped to classify the skulls , he found a degraded mixture which utterly baffled him .
they were mostly lower than the piltdown man in the scale of evolution , but in every case definitely human .
many were of higher grade , and a very few were the skulls of supremely and sensitively developed types .
all the bones were gnawed , mostly by rats , but somewhat by others of the drove .
mixed with them were many tiny hones of rats fallen members of the lethal army which closed the ancient epic .
i wonder that any man among us lived and kept his sanity through that hideous day of discovery .
not hoffman nor huysmans could conceive a scene more wildly incredible , more frenetically repellent , or more gothically grotesque than the twilit grotto through which we seven staggered ; each stumbling on revelation after revelation , and trying to keep for the nonce from thinking of the events which must have taken place there three hundred , or a thousand , or two thousand or ten thousand years ago .
it was the antechamber of hell , and poor thornton fainted again when trask told him that some of the skeleton things must have descended as quadrupeds through the last twenty or more generations .
horror piled on horror as we began to interpret the architectural remains .
the quadruped things with their occasional recruits from the biped class had been kept in stone pens , out of which they must have broken in their last delirium of hunger or .
there had been great herds of them , evidently fattened on the coarse vegetables whose remains could be found as a sort of poisonous ensilage at the bottom of the huge stone bins older than rome .
i knew now why my ancestors had had such excessive gardens would to heaven i could forget !
the purpose of the herds i did not have to ask .
sir william , standing with his searchlight in the roman ruin , translated aloud the most shocking ritual i have ever known ; and told of the diet of the antediluvian cult which the priests of cybele found and mingled with their own .
norrys , used as he was to the trenches , could not walk straight when he came out of the english building .
it was a butcher shop and kitchen he had expected that but it was too much to see familiar english implements in such a place , and to read familiar english graffiti there , some as recent as .
i could not go in that building that building whose daemon activities were stopped only by the dagger of my ancestor walter de la poer .
what i did venture to enter was the low saxon building whose oaken door had fallen , and there i found a terrible row of ten stone cells with rusty bars .
three had tenants , all skeletons of high grade , and on the bony forefinger of one i found a seal ring with my own arms .
sir william found a vault with far older cells below the roman chapel , but these cells were empty .
below them was a low crypt with cases of formally arranged bones , some of them bearing terrible parallel inscriptions carved in latin , greek , and the tongue of phyrgia .
meanwhile , dr trask had opened one of the prehistoric tumuli , and brought to light skulls which were slightly more human than a gorilla , and which bore indescribably ideographic carvings .
through all this horror my cat stalked unperturbed .
once i saw him monstrously perched atop a mountain of bones , and wondered at the secrets that might lie behind his yellow eyes .
having grasped to some slight degree the frightful revelations of this twilit area an area so hideously foreshadowed by my recurrent dream we turned to that apparently boundless depth of midnight cavern where no ray of light from the cliff could penetrate .
we shall never know what sightless stygian worlds yawn beyond the little distance we went , for it was decided that such secrets are not good for mankind .
but there was plenty to engross us close at hand , for we had not gone far before the searchlights showed that accursed infinity of pits in which the rats had feasted , and whose sudden lack of replenishment had driven the ravenous rodent army first to turn on the living herds of starving things , and then to burst forth from the priory in that historic orgy of devastation which the peasants will never forget .
god !
those carrion black pits of sawed , picked bones and opened skulls !
those nightmare chasms choked with the pithecanthropoid , celtic , roman , and english bones of countless unhallowed centuries !
some of them were full , and none can say how deep they had once been .
others were still bottomless to our searchlights , and peopled by unnamable fancies .
what , i thought , of the hapless rats that stumbled into such traps amidst the blackness of their quests in this grisly tartarus ?
once my foot slipped near a horribly yawning brink , and i had a moment of ecstatic fear .
i must have been musing a long time , for i could not see any of the party but plump capt .
norrys .
then there came a sound from that inky , boundless , farther distance that i thought i knew ; and i saw my old black cat dart past me like a winged egyptian god , straight into the illimitable gulf of the unknown .
but i was not far behind , for there was no doubt after another second .
it was the eldritch scurrying of those rats , always questing for new horrors , and determined to lead me on even unto those grinning caverns of earth centre where nyarlathotep , the mad faceless god , howls blindly in the darkness to the piping of two amorphous idiot flute players .
my searchlight expired , but still i ran .
i heard voices , and yowls , and echoes , but above all there gently rose that impious , insidious scurrying ; gently rising , rising , as a stiff bloated corpse gently rises above an oily river that flows under the endless onyx bridges to a black , putrid sea .
something bumped into me something soft and plump .
it must have been the rats ; the viscous , gelatinous , ravenous army that feast on the dead and the living why should rats eat a de la poer as a de la poer eats forbidden things ? the war ate my boy , damn them all and the yanks ate carfax with flames and burnt grandsire delapore and the secret no , no , i tell you , i am not that daemon swineherd in the twilit grotto !
it was not edward norrys ' fat face on that flabby fungous thing !
who says i am a de la poer ?
he lived , but my boy died ! shall a norrys hold the land of a de la poer ? it voodoo , i tell you that spotted snake curse you , thornton , i teach you to faint at what my family do !
, thou stinkard , i learn ye how to gust wolde ye swynke me thilke wys ? magna mater !
magna mater ! atys dia ad aghaidh ad aodaun agus bas dunarch ort !
dhonas dholas ort , agus ! ungl unl rrlh chchch
this is what they say i said when they found me in the blackness after three hours ; found me crouching in the blackness over the plump , half eaten body of capt .
norrys , with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat .
now they have blown up exham priory , taken my away from me , and shut me into this barred room at hanwell with fearful whispers about my heredity and experience .
thornton is in the next room , but they prevent me from talking to him .
they are trying , too , to suppress most of the facts concerning the priory .
when i speak of poor norrys they accuse me of this hideous thing , but they must know that i did not do it .
they must know it was the rats ; the slithering scurrying rats whose scampering will never let me sleep ; the daemon rats that race behind the padding in this room and beckon me down to greater horrors than i have ever known ; the rats they can never hear ; the rats , the rats in the walls .
i v i from even the greatest of horrors irony is seldom absent .
sometimes it enters directly into the composition of the events , while sometimes it relates only to their fortuitous position among persons and places .
the latter sort is splendidly exemplified by a case in the ancient city of providence , where in the late forties edgar allan poe used to sojourn often during his unsuccessful wooing of the gifted poetess , whitman .
poe generally stopped at the mansion house in benefit street the renamed golden ball inn whose roof has sheltered washington , jefferson , and lafayette and his favourite walk led northward along the same street to whitman home and the neighbouring hillside churchyard of john whose hidden expanse of gravestones had for him a peculiar fascination .
now the irony is this .
in this walk , so many times repeated , the world greatest master of the terrible and the bizarre was obliged to pass a particular house on the eastern side of the street ; a dingy , antiquated structure perched on the abruptly rising side hill , with a great unkept yard dating from a time when the region was partly open country .
it does not appear that he ever wrote or spoke of it , nor is there any evidence that he even noticed it .
and yet that house , to the two persons in possession of certain information , equals or outranks in horror the wildest phantasy of the genius who so often passed it unknowingly , and stands starkly leering as a symbol of all that is unutterably hideous .
the house was and for that matter still is of a kind to attract the attention of the curious .
originally a farm or building , it followed the average new england colonial lines of the middle eighteenth century the prosperous sort , with two stories and dormerless attic , and with the georgian doorway and interior paneling dictated by the progress of taste at that time .
it faced south , with one gable end buried to the lower windows in the eastward rising hill , and the other exposed to the foundations toward the street .
its construction , over a century and a half ago , had followed the grading and straightening of the road in that especial vicinity ; for benefit street at first called back street was laid out as a lane winding amongst the graveyards of the first settlers , and straightened only when the removal of the bodies to the north burial ground made it decently possible to cut through the old family plots .
at the start , the western wall had lain some twenty feet up a precipitous lawn from the roadway ; but a widening of the street at about the time of the revolution sheared off most of the intervening space , exposing the foundations so that a brick basement wall had to be made , giving the deep cellar a street frontage with the door and two windows above ground , close to the new line of public travel .
when the sidewalk was laid out a century ago the last of the intervening space was removed ; and poe in his walks must have seen only a sheer ascent of dull grey brick flush with the sidewalk and surmounted at a height of ten feet by the antique shingled bulk of the house proper .
the grounds extended back very deeply up the hill , al most to wheaton street .
the space south of the house , abutting on benefit street , was of course greatly above the existing sidewalk level , forming a terrace bounded by a high bank wall of damp , mossy stone pierced by a steep flight of narrow steps which led inward between surfaces to the upper region of mangy lawn , rheumy brick walls , and neglected gardens whose dismantled cement urns , rusted kettles fallen from tripods of knotty sticks , and similar paraphernalia set off the front door with its broken fanlight , rotting ionic pilasters , and wormy triangular pediment .
what i heard in my youth about the shunned house was merely that people died there in alarmingly great numbers .
that , i was told , was why the original owners had moved out some twenty years after building the place .
it was plainly unhealthy , perhaps because of the dampness and fungous growth in the cellar , the general sickish smell , the draughts of the hallways , or the quality of the well and pump water .
these things were bad enough , and these were all that gained belief among the person whom i knew .
only the notebooks of my antiquarian uncle , elihu whipple , revealed to me at length the darker , vaguer surmises which formed an undercurrent of among servants and humble folk , surmises which never travelled far , and which were largely forgotten when providence grew to be a metropolis with a shifting modern population .
the general fact is , that the house was never regarded by the solid part of the community as in any real sense haunted .
there were no widespread tales of rattling chains , cold currents of air , extinguished lights , or faces at the window .
extremists sometimes said the house was unlucky , but that is as far as even they went .
what was really beyond dispute is that a frightful proportion of persons died there ; or more accurately , had died there , since after some peculiar happenings over sixty years ago the building had become deserted through the sheer impossibility of renting it .
these persons were not all cut off suddenly by any one cause ; rather did it seem that their vitality was insidiously sapped , so that each one died the sooner from whatever tendency to weakness he may have naturally had .
and those who did not die displayed in varying degree a type of anaemia or consumption , and sometimes a decline of the mental faculties , which spoke ill for the salubriousness of the building .
neighbouring houses , it must be added , seemed entirely free from the noxious quality .
this much i knew before my insistent questioning led my uncle to show me the notes which finally embarked us both on our hideous investigation .
in my childhood the shunned house was vacant , with barren , gnarled and terrible old trees , long , queerly pale grass and nightmarishly misshapen weeds in the high terraced yard where birds never lingered .
we boys used to overrun the place , and i can still recall my youthful terror not only at the morbid strangeness of this sinister vegetation , but at the eldritch atmosphere and odour of the dilapidated house , whose unlocked front door was often entered in quest of shudders .
the windows were largely broken , and a nameless air of desolation hung round the precarious panelling , shaky interior shutters , peeling wallpaper , falling plaster , rickety staircases , and such fragments of battered furniture as still remained .
the dust and cobwebs added their touch of the fearful ; and brave indeed was the boy who would voluntarily ascend the ladder to the attic , a vast raftered length lighted only by small blinking windows in the gable ends , and filled with a massed wreckage of chests , chairs , and which infinite years of deposit had shrouded and festooned into monstrous and hellish shapes .
but after all , the attic was not the most terrible part of the house .
it was the dank , humid cellar which somehow exerted the strongest repulsion on us , even though it was wholly above ground on the street side , with only a thin door and brick wall to separate it from the busy sidewalk .
we scarcely knew whether to haunt it in spectral fascination , or to shun it for the sake of our souls and our sanity .
for one thing , the bad odour of the house was strongest there ; and for another thing , we did not like the white fungous growths which occasionally sprang up in rainy summer weather from the hard earth floor .
those fungi , grotesquely like the vegetation in the yard outside , were truly horrible in their outlines ; detestable parodies of toadstools and indian pipes , whose like we had never seen in any other situation .
they rotted quickly , and at one stage became slightly phosphorescent ; so that nocturnal sometimes spoke of witch fires glowing behind the broken panes of the windows .
we never even in our wildest moods visited this cellar by night , but in some of our daytime visits could detect the phosphorescence , especially when the day was dark and wet .
there was also a subtler thing we often thought we detected a very strange thing which was , however , merely suggestive at most .
i refer to a sort of cloudy whitish pattern on the dirt floor a vague , shifting deposit of mould or nitre which we sometimes thought we could trace amidst the sparse fungous growths near the huge fireplace of the basement kitchen .
once in a while it struck us that this patch bore an uncanny resemblance to a human figure , though generally no such kinship existed , and often there was no whitish deposit whatever .
on a certain rainy afternoon when this illusion seemed phenomenally strong , and when , in addition , i had fancied i glimpsed a kind of thin , yellowish , shimmering exhalation rising from the nitrous pattern toward the yawning fireplace , i spoke to my uncle about the matter .
he smiled at this odd conceit , but it seemed that his smile was tinged with reminiscence .
later i heard that a similar notion entered into some of the wild ancient tales of the common folk a notion likewise alluding to ghoulish , wolfish shapes taken by smoke from the great chimney , and queer contours assumed by certain of the sinuous tree roots that thrust their way into the cellar through the loose .
not till my adult years did my uncle set before me the notes and data which he had collected concerning the shunned house .
whipple was a sane , conservative physician of the old school , and for all his interest in the place was not eager to encourage young thoughts toward the abnormal .
his own view , postulating simply a building and location of markedly unsanitary qualities , had nothing to do with abnormality ; but he realized that the very picturesqueness which aroused his own interest would in a boy fanciful mind take on all manner of gruesome imaginative associations .
the doctor was a bachelor ; a , , gentleman , and a local historian of note , who had often broken a lance with such controversial guardians of tradition as sidney rider and thomas bicknell .
he lived with one manservant in a georgian homestead with knocker and steps , balanced eerily on the steep ascent of north court street beside the ancient brick court and colony house where his grandfather a cousin of that celebrated privateersman , capt .
whipple , who burnt his majesty armed schooner gaspee in had voted in the legislature on may , , for the independence of the rhode island colony .
around him in the damp , library with the musty white paneling , heavy carved overmantel and , windows , were the relics and records of his ancient family , among which were many dubious allusions to the shunned house in benefit street .
that pest spot lies not far distant for benefit runs ledgewise just above the court house along the precipitous hill up which the first settlement climbed .
when , in the end , my insistent pestering and maturing years evoked from my uncle the hoarded lore i sought , there lay before me a strange enough chronicle .
, statistical , and drearily genealogical as some of the matter was , there ran through it a continuous thread of brooding , tenacious horror and preternatural malevolence which impressed me even more than it had impressed the good doctor .
separate events fitted together uncannily , and seemingly irrelevant details held mines of hideous possibilities .
a new and burning curiosity grew in me , compared to which my boyish curiosity was feeble and inchoate .
the first revelation led to an exhaustive research , and finally to that shuddering quest which proved so disastrous to myself and mine .
for at last my uncle insisted on joining the search i had commenced , and after a certain night in that house he did not come away with me .
i am lonely without that gentle soul whose long years were filled only with honour , virtue , good taste , benevolence , and learning .
i have reared a marble urn to his memory in john churchyard the place that poe loved the hidden grove of giant willows on the hill , where tombs and headstones huddle quietly between the hoary bulk of the church and the houses and bank walls of benefit street .
the history of the house , opening amidst a maze of dates , revealed no trace of the sinister either about its construction or about the prosperous and honourable family who built it .
yet from the first a taint of calamity , soon increased to boding significance , was apparent .
my uncle carefully compiled record began with the building of the structure in , and followed the theme with an unusual amount of detail .
the shunned house , it seems , was first inhabited by william harris and his wife rhoby dexter , with their children , elkanah , born in , abigail , born in , william , , born in , and ruth , born in .
harris was a substantial merchant and seaman in the west india trade , connected with the firm of obadiah brown and his nephews .
after brown death in , the new firm of nicholas brown amp ; made him master of the brig prudence , , of tons , thus enabling him to erect the new homestead he had desired ever since his marriage .
the site he had chosen a recently straightened part of the new and fashionable back street , which ran along the side of the hill above crowded cheapside was all that could be wished , and the building did justice to the location .
it was the best that moderate means could afford , and harris hastened to move in before the birth of a fifth child which the family expected .
that child , a boy , came in december ; but was .
nor was any child to be born alive in that house for a century and a half .
the next april sickness occurred among the children , and abigail and ruth died before the month was over .
job ives diagnosed the trouble as some infantile fever , though others declared it was more of a mere or decline .
it seemed , in any event , to be contagious ; for hannah bowen , one of the two servants , died of it in the following june .
eli liddeason , the other servant , constantly complained of weakness ; and would have returned to his father farm in rehoboth but for a sudden attachment for mehitabel pierce , who was hired to succeed hannah .
he died the next year a sad year indeed , since it marked the death of william harris himself , enfeebled as he was by the climate of martinique , where his occupation had kept him for considerable periods during the preceding decade .
the widowed rhoby harris never recovered from the shock of her husband death , and the passing of her firstborn elkanah two years later was the final blow to her reason .
in she fell victim to a mild form of insanity , and was thereafter confined to the upper part of the house , her elder maiden sister , mercy dexter , having moved in to take charge of the family .
mercy was a plain , woman of great strength , but her health visibly declined from the time of her advent .
she was greatly devoted to her unfortunate sister , and had an especial affection for her only surviving nephew william , who from a sturdy infant had become a sickly , spindling lad .
in this year the servant mehitabel died , and the other servant , preserved smith , left without coherent explanation or at least , with only some wild tales and a complaint that he disliked the smell of the place .
for a time mercy could secure no more help , since the seven deaths and case of madness , all occurring within five years ' space , had begun to set in motion the body of fireside rumour which later became so bizarre .
ultimately , however , she obtained new servants from out of town ; ann white , a morose woman from that part of north kingstown now set off as the township of exeter , and a capable boston man named zenas low .
it was ann white who first gave definite shape to the sinister idle talk .
mercy should have known better than to hire anyone from the nooseneck hill country , for that remote bit of backwoods was then , as now , a seat of the most uncomfortable superstitions .
as lately as an exeter community exhumed a dead body and ceremoniously burnt its heart in order to prevent certain alleged visitations injurious to the public health and peace , and one may imagine the point of view of the same section in .
ann tongue was perniciously active , and within a few months mercy discharged her , filling her place with a faithful and amiable amazon from newport , maria robbins .
meanwhile poor rhoby harris , in her madness , gave voice to dreams and imaginings of the most hideous sort .
at times her screams became insupportable , and for long periods she would utter shrieking horrors which necessitated her son temporary residence with his cousin , peleg harris , in presbyterian lane near the new college building .
the boy would seem to improve after these visits , and had mercy been as wise as she was , she would have let him live permanently with peleg .
just what harris cried out in her fits of violence , tradition hesitates to say ; or rather , presents such extravagant accounts that they nullify themselves through sheer absurdity .
certainly it sounds absurd to hear that a woman educated only in the rudiments of french often shouted for hours in a coarse and idiomatic form of that language , or that the same person , alone and guarded , complained wildly of a staring thing which bit and chewed at her .
in the servant zenas died , and when harris heard of it she laughed with a shocking delight utterly foreign to her .
the next year she herself died , and was laid to rest in the north burial ground beside her husband .
upon the outbreak of trouble with great britain in , william harris , despite his scant sixteen years and feeble constitution , managed to enlist in the army of observation under general greene ; and from that time on enjoyed a steady rise in health and prestige .
in , as a captain in rhode island forces in new jersey under colonel angell , he met and married phebe hetfield of elizabethtown , whom he brought to providence upon his honourable discharge in the following year .
the young soldier return was not a thing of unmitigated happiness .
the house , it is true , was still in good condition ; and the street had been widened and changed in name from back street to benefit street .
but mercy dexter once robust frame had undergone a sag and curious decay , so that she was now a stooped and pathetic figure with hollow voice and disconcerting pallor qualities shared to a singular degree by the one remaining servant maria .
in the autumn of phebe harris gave birth to a daughter , and on the fifteenth of the next may mercy dexter took leave of a useful , austere , and virtuous life .
william harris , at last thoroughly convinced of the radically unhealthful nature of his abode , now took steps toward quitting it and closing it forever .
securing temporary quarters for himself and wife at the newly opened golden ball inn , he arranged for the building of a new and finer house in westminster street , in the growing part of the town across the great bridge .
there , in , his son dutee was born ; and there the family dwelt till the encroachments of commerce drove them back across the river and over the hill to angell street , in the newer east side residence district , where the late archer harris built his sumptuous but hideous mansion in .
william and phebe both succumbed to the yellow fever epidemic in , but dutee was brought up by his cousin rathbone harris , peleg son .
rathbone was a practical man , and rented the benefit street house despite william wish to keep it vacant .
he considered it an obligation to his ward to make the most of all the boy property , nor did he concern himself with the deaths and illnesses which caused so many changes of tenants , or the steadily growing aversion with which the house was generally regarded .
it is likely that he felt only vexation when , in , the town council ordered him to fumigate the place with sulphur , tar and gum camphor on account of the deaths of four persons , presumably caused by the then diminishing fever epidemic .
they said the place had a febrile smell .
dutee himself thought little of the house , for he grew up to be a privateersman , and served with distinction on the vigilant under capt .
cahoone in the war of .
he returned unharmed , married in , and became a father on that memorable night of september , , when a great gale drove the waters of the bay over half the town , and floated a tall sloop well up westminster street so that its masts almost tapped the harris windows in symbolic affirmation that the new boy , welcome , was a seaman son .
welcome did not survive his father , but lived to perish gloriously at fredericksburg in .
neither he nor his son archer knew of the shunned house as other than a nuisance almost impossible to rent perhaps on account of the mustiness and sickly odour of unkempt old age .
indeed , it never was rented after a series of deaths culminating in , which the excitement of the war tended to throw into obscurity .
carrington harris , last of the male line , knew it only as a deserted and somewhat picturesque center of legend until i told him my experience .
he had meant to tear it down and build an apartment house on the site , but after my account , decided to let it stand , install plumbing , and rent it .
nor has he yet had any difficulty in obtaining tenants .
the horror has gone .
it may well be imagined how powerfully i was affected by the annals of the harrises .
in this continuous record there seemed to me to brood a persistent evil beyond anything in nature as i had known it ; an evil clearly connected with the house and not with the family .
this impression was confirmed by my uncle less systematic array of miscellaneous data legends transcribed from servant gossip , cuttings from the papers , copies of death certificates by , and the like .
all of this material i can not hope to give , for my uncle was a tireless antiquarian and very deeply interested in the shunned house ; but i may refer to several dominant points which earn notice by their recurrence through many reports from diverse sources .
for example , the servant gossip was practically unanimous in attributing to the fungous and malodorous cellar of the house a vast supremacy in evil influence .
there had been servants ann white especially who would not use the cellar kitchen , and at least three legends bore upon the queer or diabolic outlines assumed by and patches of mould in that region .
these latter narratives interested me profoundly , on account of what i had seen in my boyhood , but i felt that most of the significance had in each case been largely obscured by additions from the common stock of local ghost lore .
ann white , with her exeter superstition , had promulgated the most extravagant and at the same time most consistent tale ; alleging that there must lie buried beneath the house one of those vampires the dead who retain their bodily form and live on the blood or breath of the living whose hideous legions send their preying shapes or spirits abroad by night .
to destroy a vampire one must , the grandmothers say , exhume it and burn its heart , or at least drive a stake through that organ ; and ann dogged insistence on a search under the cellar had been prominent in bringing about her discharge .
her tales , however , commanded a wide audience , and were the more readily accepted because the house indeed stood on land once used for burial purposes .
to me their interest depended less on this circumstance than on the peculiarly appropriate way in which they with certain other things the complaint of the departing servant preserved smith , who had preceded ann and never heard of her , that something sucked his breath at night ; the of fever victims of , issued by chad hopkins , and showing the four deceased persons all unaccountably lacking in blood ; and the obscure passages of poor rhoby harris ravings , where she complained of the sharp teeth of a , presence .
free from unwarranted superstition though i am , these things produced in me an odd sensation , which was intensified by a pair of widely separated newspaper cuttings relating to deaths in the shunned house one from the providence gazette and of april , , and the other from the daily transcript and chronicle of october , each of which detailed an appallingly grisly circumstance whose duplication was remarkable .
it seems that in both instances the dying person , in a gentle old lady named stafford and in a of middle age named eleazar durfee , became transfigured in a horrible way ; glaring glassily and attempting to bite the throat of the attending physician .
even more puzzling , though , was the final case which put an end to the renting of the house a series of anaemia deaths preceded by progressive madnesses wherein the patient would craftily attempt the lives of his relatives by incisions in the neck or wrists .
this was in and , when my uncle had just begun his medical practice ; and before leaving for the front he heard much of it from his elder professional colleagues .
the really inexplicable thing was the way in which the victims ignorant people , for the and widely shunned house could now be rented to no others would babble maledictions in french , a language they could not possibly have studied to any extent .
it made one think of poor rhoby harris nearly a century before , and so moved my uncle that he commenced collecting historical data on the house after listening , some time subsequent to his return from the war , to the account of drs .
chase and whitmarsh .
indeed , i could see that my uncle had thought deeply on the subject , and that he was glad of my own interest an and sympathetic interest which enabled him to discuss with me matters at which others would merely have laughed .
his fancy had not gone so far as mine , but he felt that the place was rare in its imaginative potentialities , and worthy of note as an inspiration in the field of the grotesque and macabre .
for my part , i was disposed to take the whole subject with profound seriousness , and began at once not only to review the evidence , but to accumulate as much as i could .
i talked with the elderly archer harris , then owner of the house , many times before his death in ; and obtained from him and his still surviving maiden sister alice an authentic corroboration of all the family data my uncle had collected .
when , however , i asked them what connection with france or its language the house could have , they confessed themselves as frankly baffled and ignorant as archer knew nothing , and all that miss harris could say was that an old allusion her grandfather , dutee harris , had heard of might have shed a little light .
the old seaman , who had survived his son welcome death in battle by two years , had not himself known the legend ; but recalled that his earliest nurse , the ancient maria robbins , seemed darkly aware of something that might have lent a weird significance to the french ravings of rhoby harris , which she had so often heard during the last days of that hapless woman .
maria had been at the shunned house from till the removal of the family in , and had seen mercy dexter die .
once she hinted to the child dutee of a somewhat peculiar circumstance in mercy last moments , but he had soon for gotten all about it save that it was something peculiar .
the granddaughter , moreover , recalled even this much with difficulty .
she and her brother were not so much interested in the house as was archer son carrington , the present owner , with whom i talked after my experience .
having exhausted the harris family of all the information it could furnish , i turned my attention to early town records and deeds with a zeal more penetrating than that which my uncle had occasionally shown in the same work .
what i wished was a comprehensive history of the site from its very settlement in or even before , if any narragansett indian legend could be unearthed to supply the data .
i found , at the start , that the land had been part of a long strip of the lot granted originally to john throckmorton ; one of many similar strips beginning at the town street beside the river and extending up over the hill to a line roughly corresponding with the modern hope street .
the throckmorton lot had later , of course , been much subdivided ; and i became very assiduous in tracing that section through which back or benefit street was later run .
it had , a rumour indeed said , been the throckmorton graveyard ; but as i examined the records more carefully , i found that the graves had all been transferred at an early date to the north burial ground on the pawtucket west road .
then suddenly i came by a rare piece of chance , since it was not in the main body of records and might easily have been missed upon something which aroused my keenest eagerness , fitting in as it did with several of the queerest phases of the affair .
it was the record of a lease in , of a small tract of ground to an etienne roulet and wife .
at last the french element had appeared that , and another deeper element of horror which the name conjured up from the darkest recesses of my weird and heterogeneous reading and i feverishly studied the platting of the locality as it had been before the cutting through and partial straightening of back street between and .
i found what i had half expected , that where the shunned house now stood , the roulets had laid out their graveyard behind a and attic cottage , and that no record of any transfer of graves existed .
the document , indeed , ended in much confusion ; and i was forced to ransack both the rhode island historical society and shepley library before i could find a local door which the name of etienne roulet would unlock .
in the end i did find something ; something of such vague but monstrous import that i set about at once to examine the cellar of the shunned house itself with a new and excited minuteness .
the roulets , it seemed , had come in from east greenwich , down the west shore of narragansett bay .
they were huguenots from caude , and had encountered much opposition before the providence selectmen allowed them to settle in the town .
unpopularity had dogged them in east greenwich , whither they had come in , after the revocation of the edict of nantes , and rumour said that the cause of dislike extended beyond mere racial and national prejudice , or the land disputes which involved other french settlers with the english in rivalries which not even governor andros could quell .
but their ardent protestantism too ardent , some whispered and their evident distress when virtually driven from the village had been granted a haven ; and the swarthy etienne roulet , less apt at agriculture than at reading queer books and drawing queer diagrams , was given a clerical post in the warehouse at pardon tillinghast wharf , far south in town street .
there had , however , been a riot of some sort later on perhaps forty years later , after old roulet death and no one seemed to hear of the family after that .
for a century and more , it appeared , the roulets had been well remembered and frequently discussed as vivid incidents in the quiet life of a new england seaport .
etienne son paul , a surly fellow whose erratic conduct had probably provoked the riot which wiped out the family , was particularly a source of speculation ; and though providence never shared the witchcraft panics of her puritan neighbours , it was freely intimated by old wives that his prayers were neither uttered at the proper time nor directed toward the proper object .
all this had undoubtedly formed the basis of the legend known by old maria robbins .
what relation it had to the french ravings of rhoby harris and other inhabitants of the shunned house , imagination or future discovery alone could determine .
i wondered how many of those who had known the legends realized that additional link with the terrible which my wider reading had given me ; that ominous item in the annals of morbid horror which tells of the creature jacques roulet , of caude , who in was condemned to death as a daemoniac but afterward saved from the stake by the paris parliament and shut in a madhouse .
he had been found covered with blood and shreds of flesh in a wood , shortly after the killing and rending of a boy by a pair of wolves .
one wolf was seen to lope away unhurt .
surely a pretty hearthside tale , with a queer significance as to name and place ; but i decided that the providence gossips could not have generally known of it .
had they known , the coincidence of names would have brought some drastic and frightened action indeed , might not its limited whispering have precipitated the final riot which erased the roulets from the town ?
i now visited the accursed place with increased frequency ; studying the unwholesome vegetation of the garden , examining all the walls of the building , and poring over every inch of the earthen cellar floor .
finally , with carrington harris permission , i fitted a key to the disused door opening from the cellar directly upon benefit street , preferring to have a more immediate access to the outside world than the dark stairs , ground floor hall , and front door could give .
there , where morbidity lurked most thickly , i searched and poked during long afternoons when the sunlight filtered in through the cobwebbed above ground door which placed me only a few feet from the placid sidewalk outside .
nothing new rewarded my efforts only the same depressing mustiness and faint suggestions of noxious odours and nitrous outlines on the floor and i fancy that many pedestrians must have watched me curiously through the broken panes .
at length , upon a suggestion of my uncle , i decided to try the spot nocturnally ; and one stormy midnight ran the beams of an electric torch over the mouldy floor with its uncanny shapes and distorted , fungi .
the place had dispirited me curiously that evening , and i was almost prepared when i saw or thought i saw amidst the whitish deposits a particularly sharp definition of the huddled form i had suspected from boyhood .
its clearness was astonishing and unprecedented and as i watched i seemed to see again the thin , yellowish , shimmering exhalation which had startled me on that rainy afternoon so many years before .
above the anthropomorphic patch of mould by the fireplace it rose ; a subtle , sickish , almost luminous vapour which , as it hung trembling in the dampness , seemed to develop vague and shocking suggestions of form , gradually trailing off into nebulous decay and passing up into the blackness of the great chimney with a foetor in its wake .
it was truly horrible , and the more so to me because of what i knew of the spot .
refusing to flee , i watched it fade and as i watched i felt that it was in turn watching me greedily with eyes more imaginable than visible .
when i told my uncle about it he was greatly aroused ; and after a tense hour of reflection , arrived at a definite and drastic decision .
weighing in his mind the importance of the matter , and the significance of our relation to it , he insisted that we both test and if possible destroy the horror of the house by a joint night or nights of aggressive vigil in that musty and cellar .
on wednesday , june , , after a proper notification of carrington harris which did not include surmises as to what we expected to find , my uncle and i conveyed to the shunned house two camp chairs and a folding camp cot , together with some scientific mechanism of greater weight and intricacy .
these we placed in the cellar during the day , screening the windows with paper and planning to return in the evening for our first vigil .
we had locked the door from the cellar to the ground floor ; and having a key to the outside cellar door , we were prepared to leave our expensive and delicate apparatus which we had obtained secretly and at great cost as many days as our vigil might need to be protracted .
it was our design to sit up together till very late , and then watch singly till dawn in stretches , myself first and then my companion ; the inactive member resting on the cot .
the natural leadership with which my uncle procured the instruments from the laboratories of brown university and the cranston street armory , and instinctively assumed direction of our venture , was a marvellous commentary on the potential vitality and resilience of a man of .
elihu whipple had lived according to the hygienic laws he had preached as a physician , and but for what happened later would be here in full vigour today .
only two persons suspect what did happen carrington harris and myself .
i had to tell harris because he owned the house and deserved to know what had gone out of it .
then , too , we had spoken to him in advance of our quest ; and i felt after my uncle going that he would understand and assist me in some vitally necessary public explanations .
he turned very pale , but agreed to help me , and decided that it would now be safe to rent the house .
to declare that we were not nervous on that rainy night of watching would be an exaggeration both gross and ridiculous .
we were not , as i have said , in any sense childishly superstitious , but scientific study and reflection had taught us that the known universe of three dimensions embraces the merest fraction of the whole cosmos of substance and energy .
in this case an overwhelming preponderance of evidence from numerous authentic sources pointed to the tenacious existence of certain forces of great power and , so far as the human point of view is concerned , exceptional malignancy .
to say that we actually believed in vampires or werewolves would be a carelessly inclusive statement .
rather must it be said that we were not prepared to deny the possibility of certain unfamiliar and unclassified modifications of vital force and attenuated matter ; existing very infrequently in space because of its more intimate connection with other spatial units , yet close enough to the boundary of our own to furnish us occasional manifestations which we , for lack of a proper , may never hope to understand .
in short , it seemed to my uncle and me that an incontrovertible array of facts pointed to some lingering influence in the shunned house ; traceable to one or another of the french settlers of two centuries before , and still operative through rare and unknown laws of atomic and electronic motion .
that the family of roulet had possessed an abnormal affinity for outer circles of entity dark spheres which for normal folk hold only repulsion and terror their recorded history seemed to prove .
had not , then , the riots of those bygone set moving certain kinetic patterns in the morbid brain of one or more of them notably the sinister paul roulet which obscurely survived the bodies murdered , and continued to function in some space along the original lines of force determined by a frantic hatred of the encroaching community ?
such a thing was surely not a physical or biochemical impossibility in the light of a newer science which includes the theories of relativity and action .
one might easily imagine an alien nucleus of substance or energy , formless or otherwise , kept alive by imperceptible or immaterial subtractions from the or bodily tissue and fluids of other and more palpably living things into which it penetrates and with whose fabric it sometimes completely merges itself .
it might be actively hostile , or it might be dictated merely by blind motives of .
in any case such a monster must of necessity be in our scheme of things an anomaly and an intruder , whose extirpation forms a primary duty with every man not an enemy to the world life , health , and sanity .
what baffled us was our utter ignorance of the aspect in which we might encounter the thing .
no sane person had even seen it , and few had ever felt it definitely .
it might be pure energy a form ethereal and outside the realm of substance or it might be partly material ; some unknown and equivocal mass of plasticity , capable of changing at will to nebulous approximations of the solid , liquid , gaseous , or tenuously unparticled states .
the anthropomorphic patch of mould on the floor , the form of the yellowish vapour , and the curvature of the in some of the old tales , all argued at least a remote and reminiscent connection with the human shape ; but how representative or permanent that similarity might be , none could say with any kind of certainty .
we had devised two weapons to fight it ; a large and specially fitted crookes tube operated by powerful storage batteries and provided with peculiar screens and reflectors , in case it proved intangible and opposable only by vigorously destructive ether radiations , and a pair of military of the sort used in the world war , in case it proved partly material and susceptible of mechanical destruction for like the superstitious exeter rustics , we were prepared to burn the thing heart out if heart existed to burn .
all this aggressive mechanism we set in the cellar in positions carefully arranged with reference to the cot and chairs , and to the spot before the fireplace where the mould had taken strange shapes .
that suggestive patch , by the way , was only faintly visible when we placed our furniture and instruments , and when we returned that evening for the actual vigil .
for a moment i that i had ever seen it in the more definitely limned form but then i thought of the legends .
our cellar vigil began at , daylight saving time , and as it continued we found no promise of pertinent developments .
a weak , filtered glow from the street lamps outside , and a feeble phosphorescence from the detestable fungi within , showed the dripping stone of the walls , from which all traces of whitewash had vanished ; the dank , foetid and hard earth floor with its obscene fungi ; the rotting remains of what had been stools , chairs and tables , and other more shapeless furniture ; the heavy planks and massive beams of the ground floor overhead ; the decrepit plank door leading to bins and chambers beneath other parts of the house ; the crumbling stone staircase with ruined wooden ; and the crude and cavernous fireplace of blackened brick where rusted iron fragments revealed the past presence of hooks , andirons , spit , crane , and a door to the dutch oven these things , and our austere cot and camp chairs , and the heavy and intricate destructive machinery we had brought .
we had , as in my own former explorations , left the door to the street unlocked ; so that a direct and practical path of escape might lie open in case of manifestations beyond our power to deal with .
it was our idea that our continued nocturnal presence would call forth whatever malign entity lurked there ; and that being prepared , we could dispose of the thing with one or the other of our provided means as soon as we had recognised and observed it sufficiently .
how long it might require to evoke and extinguish the thing , we had no notion .
it occurred to us , too , that our venture was far from safe , for in what strength the thing might appear no one could tell .
but we deemed the game worth the hazard , and embarked on it alone and unhesitatingly ; conscious that the seeking of outside aid would only expose us to ridicule and perhaps defeat our entire purpose .
such was our frame of mind as we talked far into the night , till my uncle growing drowsiness made me remind him to lie down for his sleep .
something like fear chilled me as i sat there in the small hours alone i say alone , for one who sits by a sleeper is indeed alone ; perhaps more alone than he can realise .
my uncle breathed heavily , his deep inhalations and exhalations accompanied by the rain outside , and punctuated by another sound of distant dripping water within for the house was repulsively damp even in dry weather , and in this storm positively .
i studied the loose , antique masonry of the walls in the and the feeble rays which stole in from the street through the screened windows ; and once , when the noisome atmosphere of the place seemed about to sicken me , i opened the door and looked up and down the street , feasting my eyes on familiar sights and my nostrils on wholesome air .
still nothing occurred to reward my watching ; and i yawned repeatedly , fatigue getting the better of apprehension .
then the stirring of my uncle in his sleep attracted my notice .
he had turned restlessly on the cot several times during the latter half of the first hour , but now he was breathing with unusual irregularity , occasionally heaving a sigh which held more than a few of the qualities of a choking moan .
i turned my electric flashlight on him and found his face averted , so rising and crossing to the other side of the cot , i again flashed the light to see if he seemed in any pain .
what i saw unnerved me most surprisingly , considering its relative triviality .
it must have been merely the association of an odd circumstance with the sinister nature of our location and mission , for surely the circumstance was not in itself frightful or unnatural .
it was merely that my uncle facial expression , disturbed no doubt by the strange dreams which our situation prompted , betrayed considerable agitation , and seemed not at all characteristic of him .
his habitual expression was one of kindly and calm , whereas now a variety of emotions seemed struggling within him .
i think , on the whole , that it was this variety which chiefly disturbed me .
my uncle , as he gasped and tossed in increasing perturbation and with eyes that had now started open , seemed not one man but many men , and suggested a curious quality of alienage from himself .
all at once he commenced to mutter , and i did not like the look of his mouth and teeth as he spoke .
the words were at first indistinguishable , and then with a tremendous start i recognised something about them which filled me with icy fear till i recalled the breadth of my uncle education and the interminable translations he had made from anthropological and antiquarian articles in the revue des deux mondes .
for the venerable elihu whipple was muttering in french , and the few phrases i could distinguish seemed connected with the darkest myths he had ever adapted from the famous paris magazine .
suddenly a perspiration broke out on the sleeper forehead , and he leaped abruptly up , half awake .
the jumble of french changed to a cry in english , and the hoarse voice shouted excitedly , my breath , my breath !
then the awakening became complete , and with a subsidence of facial expression to the normal state my uncle seized my hand and began to relate a dream whose nucleus of significance i could only surmise with a kind of awe .
he had , he said , floated off from a very ordinary series of into a scene whose strangeness was related to nothing he had ever read .
it was of this world , and yet not of it a shadowy geometrical confusion in which could be seen elements of familiar things in most unfamiliar and perturbing combinations .
there was a suggestion of queerly disordered pictures superimposed one upon an other ; an arrangement in which the essentials of time as well as of space seemed dissolved and mixed in the most illogical fashion .
in this kaleidoscopic vortex of phantasmal images were occasional , if one might use the term , of singular clearness but unaccountable heterogeneity .
once my uncle thought he lay in a carelessly dug open pit , with a crowd of angry faces framed by straggling locks and hats frowning down at him .
again he seemed to be in the interior of a house an old house , apparently but the details and inhabitants were constantly changing , and he could never be certain of the faces or the furniture , or even of the room itself , since doors and windows seemed in just as great a state of flux as the more presumably mobile objects .
it was queer damnably queer and my uncle spoke almost sheepishly , as if half expecting not to be believed , when he declared that of the strange faces many had unmistakably borne the features of the harris family .
and all the while there was a personal sensation of choking , as if some pervasive presence had spread itself through his body and sought to possess itself of his vital processes .
i shuddered at the thought of those vital processes , worn as they were by eighty one years of continuous functioning , in conflict with unknown forces of which the youngest and strongest system might well be afraid ; but in another moment reflected that dreams are only dreams , and that these uncomfortable visions could be , at most , no more than my uncle reaction to the investigations and expectations which had lately filled our minds to the exclusion of all else .
conversation , also , soon tended to dispel my sense of strangeness ; and in time i yielded to my yawns and took my turn at slumber .
my uncle seemed now very wakeful , and welcomed his period of watching even though the nightmare had aroused him far ahead of his allotted two hours .
sleep seized me quickly , and i was at once haunted with dreams of the most disturbing kind .
i felt , in my visions , a cosmic and abysmal loneness ; with hostility surging from all sides upon some prison where i lay confined .
i seemed bound and gagged , and taunted by the echoing yells of distant multitudes who thirsted for my blood .
my uncle face came to me with less pleasant associations than in waking hours , and i recall many futile struggles and attempts to scream .
it was not a pleasant sleep , and for a second i was not sorry for the echoing shriek which clove through the barriers of dream and flung me to a sharp and startled awakeness in which every actual object before my eyes stood out with more than natural clearness and reality .
v i had been lying with my face away from my uncle chair , so that in this sudden flash of awakening i saw only the door to the street , the more northerly window , and the wall and floor and ceiling toward the north of the room , all photographed with morbid vividness on my brain in a light brighter than the glow of the fungi or the rays from the street outside .
it was not a strong or even a fairly strong light ; certainly not nearly strong enough to read an average book by .
but it cast a shadow of myself and the cot on the floor , and had a yellowish , penetrating force that hinted at things more potent than luminosity .
this i perceived with unhealthy sharpness despite the fact that two of my other senses were violently assailed .
for on my ears rang the reverberations of that shocking scream , while my nostrils revolted at the stench which filled the place .
my mind , as alert as my senses , recognised the gravely unusual ; and almost automatically i leaped up and turned about to grasp the destructive instruments which we had left trained on the mouldy spot before the fireplace .
as i turned , i dreaded what i was to see ; for the scream had been in my uncle voice , and i knew not against what menace i should have to defend him and myself .
yet after all , the sight was worse than i had dreaded .
there are horrors beyond horrors , and this was one of those nuclei of all dreamable hideousness which the cosmos saves to blast an accursed and unhappy few .
out of the earth steamed up a vaporous , yellow and diseased , which bubbled and lapped to a gigantic height in vague outlines half human and half monstrous , through which i could see the chimney and fireplace beyond .
it was all eyes wolfish and mocking and the rugose head dissolved at the top to a thin stream of mist which curled putridly about and finally vanished up the chimney .
i say that i saw this thing , but it is only in conscious retrospection that i ever definitely traced its damnable approach to form .
at the time it was to me only a seething dimly phosphorescent cloud of fungous loathsomeness , enveloping and dissolving to an abhorrent plasticity the one object to which all my attention was focused .
that object was my uncle the venerable elihu whipple who with blackening and decaying features leered and gibbered at me , and reached out dripping claws to rend me in the fury which this horror had brought .
it was a sense of routine which kept me from going mad .
i had drilled myself in preparation for the crucial moment , and blind training saved me .
recognising the bubbling evil as no substance reachable by matter or material chemistry , and therefore ignoring the which loomed on my left , i threw on the current of the crookes tube apparatus , and focussed toward that scene of immortal blasphemousness the strongest ether radiations which men art can arouse from the spaces and fluids of nature .
there was a bluish haze and a frenzied sputtering , and the yellowish phosphorescence grew dimmer to my eyes .
but i saw the dimness was only that of contrast , and that the waves from the machine had no effect whatever .
then , in the midst of that daemoniac spectacle , i saw a fresh horror which brought cries to my lips and sent me fumbling and staggering towards that unlocked door to the quiet street , careless of what abnormal terrors i loosed upon the world , or what thoughts or judgments of men i brought down upon my head .
in that dim blend of blue and yellow the form of my uncle had commenced a nauseous liquefaction whose essence eludes all description , and in which there played across his vanishing face such changes of identity as only madness can conceive .
he was at once a devil and a multitude , a and a pageant .
lit by the mixed and uncertain beams , that gelatinous face assumed a dozen a score a hundred aspects ; grinning , as it sank to the ground on a body that melted like tallow , in the caricatured likeness of legions strange and yet not strange .
i saw the features of the harris line , masculine and feminine , adult and infantile , and other features old and young , coarse and refined , familiar and unfamiliar .
for a second there flashed a degraded counterfeit of a miniature of poor rhoby harris that i had seen in the school of design museum , and another time i thought i caught the rawboned image of mercy dexter as i recalled her from a painting in carrington harris house .
it was frightful beyond conception ; toward the last , when a curious blend of servant and baby visages flickered close to the fungous floor where a pool of greenish grease was spreading , it seemed as though the shifting features fought against themselves , and strove to form contours like those of my uncle kindly face .
i like to think that he existed at that moment , and that he tried to bid me farewell .
it seems to me i hiccoughed a farewell from my own parched throat as i lurched out into the street ; a thin stream of grease following me through the door to the sidewalk .
the rest is shadowy and monstrous .
there was no one in the soaking street , and in all the world there was no one i dared tell .
i walked aimlessly south past college hill and the athenaeum , down hopkins street , and over the bridge to the business section where tall buildings seemed to guard me as modern material things guard the world from ancient and unwholesome wonder .
then the grey dawn unfolded wetly from the east , silhouetting the archaic hill and its venerable steeples , and beckoning me to the place where my terrible work was still unfinished .
and in the end i went , wet , hatless , and dazed in the morning light , and entered that awful door in benefit street which i had left ajar , and which still swung cryptically in full sight of the early householders to whom i dared not speak .
the grease was gone , for the mouldy floor was porous .
and in front of the fireplace was no vestige of the giant form in nitre .
i looked at the cot , the chairs , the instruments , my neglected hat , and the yellowed straw hat of my uncle .
dazedness was uppermost , and i could scarcely recall what was dream and what was reality .
then thought trickled back , and i knew that i had witnessed things more horrible than i had dreamed .
sitting down , i tried to conjecture as nearly as sanity would let me just what had happened , and how i might end the horror , if indeed it had been real .
matter it seemed not to be , nor ether , nor anything else conceivable by mortal mind .
what , then , but some exotic emanation ; some vampirish vapour such as exeter rustics tell of as lurking over certain church yards ?
this i felt was the clue , and again i looked at the floor before the fireplace where the mould and nitre had taken strange forms .
in ten minutes my mind was made up , and taking my hat i set out for home , where i bathed , ate , and gave by telephone an order for a , a spade , a military , and six carboys of sulphuric acid , all to be delivered the next morning at the cellar door of the shunned house in benefit street .
after that i tried to sleep ; and failing , passed the hours in reading and in the composition of inane verses to counteract my mood .
at the next day i commenced digging .
it was sunny weather , and i was glad of that .
i was still alone , for as much as i feared the unknown horror i sought , there was more fear in the thought of telling anybody .
later i told harris only through sheer necessity , and because he had heard odd tales from old people which disposed him ever so little toward belief .
as i turned up the stinking black earth in front of the fireplace , my spade causing a viscous yellow ichor to ooze from the white fungi which it severed , i trembled at the dubious thoughts of what i might uncover .
some secrets of inner earth are not good for mankind , and this seemed to me one of them .
my hand shook perceptibly , but still i delved ; after a while standing in the large hole i had made .
with the deepening of the hole , which was about six feet square , the evil smell increased ; and i lost all doubt of my imminent contact with the hellish thing whose emanations had cursed the house for over a century and a half .
i wondered what it would look like what its form and substance would be , and how big it might have waxed through long ages of .
at length i climbed out of the hole and dispersed the dirt , then arranging the great carboys of acid around and near two sides , so that when necessary i might empty them all down the aperture in quick succession .
after that i dumped earth only along the other two sides ; working more slowly and donning my as the smell grew .
i was nearly unnerved at my proximity to a nameless thing at the bottom of a pit .
suddenly my spade struck something softer than earth .
i shuddered and made a motion as if to climb out of the hole , which was now as deep as my neck .
then courage returned , and i scraped away more dirt in the light of the electric torch i had provided .
the surface i uncovered was fishy and glassy a kind of congealed jelly with suggestions of translucency .
i scraped further , and saw that it had form .
there was a rift where a part of the substance was folded over .
the exposed area was huge and roughly cylindrical ; like a mammoth soft stovepipe doubled in two , its largest part some two feet in diameter .
still more i scraped , and then abruptly i leaped out of the hole and away from the filthy thing ; frantically unstopping and tilting the heavy carboys , and precipitating their corrosive contents one after another down that charnel gulf and upon this unthinkable abnormality whose titan elbow i had seen .
the blinding maelstrom of vapour which surged tempestuously up from that hole as the floods of acid descended , will never leave my memory .
all along the hill people tell of the yellow day , when virulent and horrible fumes arose from the factory waste dumped in the providence river , but i know how mistaken they are as to the source .
they tell , too , of the hideous roar which at the same time came from some disordered or gas main underground but again i could correct them if i dared .
it was unspeakably shocking , and i do not see how i lived through it .
i did faint after emptying the fourth carboy , which i had to handle after the fumes had begun to penetrate my mask ; but when i recovered i saw that the hole was emitting no fresh vapours .
the two remaining carboys i emptied down without particular result , and after a time i felt it safe to shovel the earth back into the pit .
it was twilight before i was done , but fear had gone out of the place .
the dampness was less foetid , and all the strange fungi had withered to a kind of harmless greyish powder which blew ashlike along the floor .
one of earth nethermost terrors had perished forever ; and if there be a hell , it had received at last the daemon soul of an unhallowed thing .
and as i patted down the last spadeful of mould , i shed the first of many tears with which i have paid unaffected tribute to my beloved uncle memory .
the next spring no more pale grass and strange weeds came up in the shunned house terraced garden , and shortly afterward carrington harris rented the place .
it is still spectral , but its strangeness fascinates me , and i shall find mixed with my relief a queer regret when it is torn down to make way for a tawdry shop or vulgar apartment building .
the barren old trees in the yard have begun to bear small , sweet apples , and last year the birds nested in their gnarled boughs .
he had read much of things as they are , and talked with too many people .
philosophers had taught him to look into the logical relations of things , and analyse the processes which shaped his thoughts and fancies .
wonder had gone away , and he had forgotten that all life is only a set of pictures in the brain , among which there is no difference betwixt those born of real things and those born of inward dreamings , and no cause to value the one above the other .
custom had dinned into his ears a superstitious reverence for that which tangibly and physically exists , and had made him secretly ashamed to dwell in visions .
wise men told him his simple fancies were inane and childish , and even more absurd because their actors persist in fancying them full of meaning and purpose as the blind cosmos grinds aimlessly on from nothing to something and from something back to nothing again , neither heeding nor knowing the wishes or existence of the minds that flicker for a second now and then in the darkness .
they had chained him down to things that are , and had then explained the workings of those things till mystery had gone out of the world .
when he complained , and longed to escape into twilight realms where magic moulded all the little vivid fragments and prized associations of his mind into vistas of breathless expectancy and unquenchable delight , they turned him instead toward the prodigies of science , bidding him find wonder in the atom vortex and mystery in the sky dimensions .
and when he had failed to find these boons in things whose laws are known and measurable , they told him he lacked imagination , and was immature because he preferred to the illusions of our physical creation .
so carter had tried to do as others did , and pretended that the common events and emotions of earthy minds were more important than the fantasies of rare and delicate souls .
he did not dissent when they told him that the animal pain of a stuck pig or dyspeptic ploughman in real life is a greater thing than the peerless beauty of narath with its hundred carven gates and domes of chalcedony , which he dimly remembered from his dreams ; and under their guidance he cultivated a painstaking sense of pity and tragedy .
once in a while , though , he could not help seeing how shallow , fickle , and meaningless all human aspirations are , and how emptily our real impulses contrast with those pompous ideals we profess to hold .
then he would have recourse to the polite laughter they had taught him to use against the extravagance and artificiality of dreams ; for he saw that the daily life of our world is every inch as extravagant and artificial , and far less worthy of respect because of its poverty in beauty and its silly reluctance to admit its own lack of reason and purpose .
in this way he became a kind of humorist , for he did not see that even humour is empty in a mindless universe devoid of any true standard of consistency or inconsistency .
in the first days of his bondage he had turned to the gentle churchly faith endeared to him by the naive trust of his fathers , for thence stretched mystic avenues which seemed to promise escape from life .
only on closer view did he mark the starved fancy and beauty , the stale and prosy triteness , and the owlish gravity and grotesque claims of solid truth which reigned boresomely and overwhelmingly among most of its professors ; or feel to the full the awkwardness with which it sought to keep alive as literal fact the outgrown fears and guesses of a primal race confronting the unknown .
it wearied carter to see how solemnly people tried to make earthly reality out of old myths which every step of their boasted science confuted , and this misplaced seriousness killed the attachment he might have kept for the ancient creeds had they been content to offer the sonorous rites and emotional outlets in their true guise of ethereal fantasy .
but when he came to study those who had thrown off the old myths , he found them even more ugly than those who had not .
they did not know that beauty lies in harmony , and that loveliness of life has no standard amidst an aimless cosmos save only its harmony with the dreams and the feelings which have gone before and blindly moulded our little spheres out of the rest of chaos .
they did not see that good and evil and beauty and ugliness are only ornamental fruits of perspective , whose sole value lies in their linkage to what chance made our fathers think and feel , and whose finer details are different for every race and culture .
instead , they either denied these things altogether or transferred them to the crude , vague instincts which they shared with the beasts and peasants ; so that their lives were dragged malodorously out in pain , ugliness , and disproportion , yet filled with a ludicrous pride at having escaped from something no more unsound than that which still held them .
they had traded the false gods of fear and blind piety for those of license and anarchy .
carter did not taste deeply of these modern freedoms ; for their cheapness and squalor sickened a spirit loving beauty alone while his reason rebelled at the flimsy logic with which their champions tried to gild brute impulse with a sacredness stripped from the idols they had discarded .
he saw that most of them , in common with their priestcraft , could not escape from the delusion that life has a meaning apart from that which men dream into it ; and could not lay aside the crude notion of ethics and obligations beyond those of beauty , even when all nature shrieked of its unconsciousness and impersonal unmorality in the light of their scientific discoveries .
warped and bigoted with preconceived illusions of justice , freedom , and consistency , they cast off the old lore and the old way with the old beliefs ; nor ever stopped to think that that lore and those ways were the sole makers of their present thoughts and judgments , and the sole guides and standards in a meaningless universe without fixed aims or stable points of reference .
having lost these artificial settings , their lives grew void of direction and dramatic interest ; till at length they strove to drown their ennui in bustle and pretended usefulness , noise and excitement , barbaric display and animal sensation .
when these things palled , disappointed , or grew nauseous through revulsion , they cultivated irony and bitterness , and found fault with the social order .
never could they realize that their brute foundations were as shifting and contradictory as the gods of their elders , and that the satisfaction of one moment is the bane of the next .
calm , lasting beauty comes only in a dream , and this solace the world had thrown away when in its worship of the real it threw away the secrets of childhood and innocence .
amidst this chaos of hollowness and unrest carter tried to live as befitted a man of keen thought and good heritage .
with his dreams fading under the ridicule of the age he could not believe in anything , but the love of harmony kept him close to the ways of his race and station .
he walked impassive through the cities of men , and sighed because no vista seemed fully real ; because every flash of yellow sunlight on tall roofs and every glimpse of balustraded plazas in the first lamps of evening served only to remind him of dreams he had once known , and to make him homesick for ethereal lands he no longer knew how to find .
travel was only a mockery ; and even the great war stirred him but little , though he served from the first in the foreign legion of france .
for a while he sought friends , but soon grew weary of the crudeness of their emotions , and the sameness and earthiness of their visions .
he felt vaguely glad that all his relatives were distant and out of touch with him , for they would not have understood his mental life .
that is , none but his grandfather and christopher could , and they were long dead .
then he began once more the writing of books , which he had left off when dreams first failed him .
but here , too , was there no satisfaction or fulfillment ; for the touch of earth was upon his mind , and he could not think of lovely things as he had done of yore .
ironic humor dragged down all the twilight minarets he reared , and the earthy fear of improbability blasted all the delicate and amazing flowers in his faery gardens .
the convention of assumed pity spilt mawkishness on his characters , while the myth of an important reality and significant human events and emotions debased all his high fantasy into thin veiled allegory and cheap social satire .
his new novels were successful as his old ones had never been ; and because he knew how empty they must be to please an empty herd , he burned them and ceased his writing .
they were very graceful novels , in which he urbanely laughed at the dreams he lightly sketched ; but he saw that their sophistication had sapped all their life away .
it was after this that he cultivated deliberate illusion , and dabbled in the notions of the bizarre and the eccentric as an antidote for the commonplace .
most of these , however , soon showed their poverty and barrenness ; and he saw that the popular doctrines of occultism are as dry and inflexible as those of science , yet without even the slender palliative of truth to redeem them .
gross stupidity , falsehood , and muddled thinking are not dream ; and form no escape from life to a mind trained above their own level .
so carter bought stranger books and sought out deeper and more terrible men of fantastic erudition ; delving into arcana of consciousness that few have trod , and learning things about the secret pits of life , legend , and immemorial antiquity which disturbed him ever afterward .
he decided to live on a rarer plane , and furnished his boston home to suit his changing moods ; one room for each , hung in appropriate colours , furnished with befitting books and objects , and provided with sources of the proper sensations of light , heat , sound , taste , and odour .
once he heard of a man in the south , who was shunned and feared for the blasphemous things he read in prehistoric books and clay tablets smuggled from india and arabia .
him he visited , living with him and sharing his studies for seven years , till horror overtook them one midnight in an unknown and archaic graveyard , and only one emerged where two had entered .
then he went back to arkham , the terrible old town of his forefathers in new england , and had experiences in the dark , amidst the hoary willows and tottering gambrel roofs , which made him seal forever certain pages in the diary of a ancestor .
but these horrors took him only to the edge of reality , and were not of the true dream country he had known in youth ; so that at fifty he despaired of any rest or contentment in a world grown too busy for beauty and too shrewd for dreams .
having perceived at last the hollowness and futility of real things , carter spent his days in retirement , and in wistful disjointed memories of his youth .
he thought it rather silly that he bothered to keep on living at all , and got from a south american acquaintance a very curious liquid to take him to oblivion without suffering .
inertia and force of habit , however , caused him to defer action ; and he lingered indecisively among thoughts of old times , taking down the strange hangings from his walls and refitting the house as it was in his early boyhood purple panes , victorian furniture , and all .
with the passage of time he became almost glad he had lingered , for his relics of youth and his cleavage from the world made life and sophistication seem very distant and unreal ; so much so that a touch of magic and expectancy stole back into his nightly slumbers .
for years those slumbers had known only such twisted reflections of every day things as the commonest slumbers know , but now there returned a flicker of something stranger and wilder ; something of vaguely awesome imminence which took the form of tensely clear pictures from his childhood days , and made him think of little inconsequential things he had long forgotten .
he would often awake calling for his mother and grandfather , both in their graves a quarter of a century .
then one night his grandfather reminded him of the key .
the grey old scholar , as vivid as in life , spoke long and earnestly of their ancient line , and of the strange visions of the delicate and sensitive men who composed it .
he spoke of the crusader who learnt wild secrets of the saracens that held him captive ; and of the first sir randolph carter who studied magic when elizabeth was queen .
he spoke , too , of that edmund carter who had just escaped hanging in the salem witchcraft , and who had placed in an antique box a great silver key handed down from his ancestors .
before carter awaked , the gentle visitant had told him where to find that box ; that carved oak box of archaic wonder whose grotesque lid no hand had raised for two centuries .
in the dust and shadows of the great attic he found it , remote and forgotten at the back of a drawer in a tall chest .
it was about a foot square , and its gothic carvings were so fearful that he did not marvel no person since edmund carter had dared to open it .
it gave forth no noise when shaken , but was mystic with the scent of unremembered spices .
that it held a key was indeed only a dim legend , and randolph carter father had never known such a box existed .
it was bound in rusty iron , and no means was provided for working the formidable lock .
carter vaguely understood that he would find within it some key to the lost gate of dreams , but of where and how to use it his grandfather had told him nothing .
an old servant forced the carven lid , shaking as he did so at the hideous faces leering from the blackened wood , and at some unplaced familiarity .
inside , wrapped in a discoloured parchment , was a huge key of tarnished silver covered with cryptical arabesques ; but of any legible explanation there was none .
the parchment was voluminous , and held only the strange hieroglyphs of an unknown tongue written with an antique reed .
carter recognized the characters as those he had seen on a certain papyrus scroll belonging to that terrible scholar of the south who had vanished one midnight in a nameless cemetery .
the man had always shivered when he read this scroll , and carter shivered now .
but he cleaned the key , and kept it by him nightly in its aromatic box of ancient oak .
his dreams were meanwhile increasing in vividness , and though showing him none of the strange cities and incredible gardens of the old days , were assuming a definite cast whose purpose could not be mistaken .
they were calling him back along the years , and with the mingled wills of all his fathers were pulling him toward some hidden and ancestral source .
then he knew he must go into the past and merge himself with old things , and day after day he thought of the hills to the north where haunted arkham and the rushing miskatonic and the lonely rustic homestead of his people lay .
in the brooding fire of autumn carter took the old remembered way past graceful lines of rolling hill and meadow , distant vale and hanging woodland , curving road and nestling farmstead , and the crystal windings of the miskatonic , crossed here and there by rustic bridges of wood or stone .
at one bend he saw the group of giant elms among which an ancestor had oddly vanished a century and a half before , and shuddered as the wind blew meaningly through them .
then there was the crumbling farmhouse of old goody fowler the witch , with its little evil windows and great roof sloping nearly to the ground on the north side .
he speeded up his car as he passed it , and did not slacken till he had mounted the hill where his mother and her fathers before her were born , and where the old white house still looked proudly across the road at the breathlessly lovely panorama of rocky slope and verdant valley , with the distant spires of kingsport on the horizon , and hints of the archaic , sea in the farthest background .
then came the steeper slope that held the old carter place he had not seen in over forty years .
afternoon was far gone when he reached the foot , and at the bend half way up he paused to scan the outspread countryside golden and glorified in the slanting floods of magic poured out by a western sun .
all the strangeness and expectancy of his recent dreams seemed present in this hushed and unearthly landscape , and he thought of the unknown solitudes of other planets as his eyes traced out the velvet and deserted lawns shining undulant between their tumbled walls , and clumps of faery forest setting off far lines of purple hills beyond hills , and the spectral wooded valley dipping down in shadow to dank hollows where trickling waters crooned and gurgled among swollen and distorted roots .
something made him feel that motors did not belong in the realm he was seeking , so he left his car at the edge of the forest , and putting the great key in his coat pocket walked on up the hill .
woods now engulfed him utterly , though he knew the house was on a high knoll that cleared the trees except to the north .
he wondered how it would look , for it had been left vacant and untended through his neglect since the death of his strange christopher thirty years before .
in his boyhood he had revelled through long visits there , and had found weird marvels in the woods beyond the orchard .
shadows thickened around him , for the night was near .
once a gap in the trees opened up to the right , so that he saw off across leagues of twilight meadow and spied the old congregational steeple on central hill in kingsport ; pink with the last flush of day , the panes of the little round windows blazing with reflected fire .
then , when he was in deep shadow again , he recalled with a start that the glimpse must have come from childish memory alone , since the old white church had long been torn down to make room for the congregational hospital .
he had read of it with interest , for the paper had told about some strange burrows or passages found in the rocky hill beneath .
through his puzzlement a voice piped , and he started again at its familiarity after long years .
old benijah corey had been his uncle christopher hired man , and was aged even in those times of his boyhood visits .
now he must be well over a hundred , but that piping voice could come from no one else .
he could distinguish no words , yet the tone was haunting and unmistakable .
to think that old benijy should still be alive !
mister randy !
mister randy !
wharbe ye ?
d want to skeer yer aunt marthy plumb to death ?
hai she tuld ye to keep nigh the place in the arternoon an ' git back afur dark ?
randy !
ran dee ! he the boy fer runnin ' off in the woods i ever see ; haff the time ' moonin ' raound that in the upper timberlot ! hey yew , ran dee !
randolph carter stopped in the pitch darkness and rubbed his hand across his eyes .
something was queer .
he had been somewhere he ought not to be ; had strayed very far away to places where he had not belonged , and was now inexcusably late .
he had not noticed the time on the kingsport steeple , though he could easily have made it out with his pocket telescope ; but he knew his lateness was something very strange and unprecedented .
he was not sure he had his little telescope with him , and put his hand in his blouse pocket to see .
no , it was not there , but there was the big silver key he had found in a box somewhere .
uncle chris had told him something odd once about an old unopened box with a key in it , but aunt martha had stopped the story abruptly , saying it was no kind of thing to tell a child whose head was already too full of queer fancies .
he tried to recall just where he had found the key , but something seemed very confused .
he guessed it was in the attic at home in boston , and dimly remembered bribing parks with half his week allowance to help him open the box and keep quiet about it ; but when he remembered this , the face of parks came up very strangely , as if the wrinkles of long years had fallen upon the brisk little cockney .
ran dee !
ran dee !
hi !
hi !
randy !
a swaying lantern came around the black bend , and old benijah pounced on the silent and bewildered form of the pilgrim .
durn ye , boy , so thar ye be !
ai ye got a tongue in yer head , that ye ca answer a body !
i ben callin ' this haff hour , an ' ye must a heerd me long ago !
du ye know yer aunt marthy all over yer bein ' off arter dark ?
wait till i tell yer uncle chris when he gits hum !
ye orta know these here woods ai no fitten place to be traipsin ' this hour !
they things abroad what du do nobody no good , as my knowed afur me .
come , mister randy , or hannah wunt keep supper no longer !
so randolph carter was marched up the road where wondering stars glimmered through high autumn boughs .
and dogs barked as the yellow light of windows shone out at the farther turn , and the pleiades twinkled across the open knoll where a great gambrel roof stood black against the dim west .
aunt martha was in the doorway , and did not scold too hard when benijah shoved the truant in .
she knew uncle chris well enough to expect such things of the carter blood .
randolph did not show his key , but ate his supper in silence and protested only when bedtime came .
he sometimes dreamed better when awake , and he wanted to use that key .
in the morning randolph was up early , and would have run off to the upper timberlot if uncle chris had not caught him and forced him into his chair by the breakfast table .
he looked impatiently around the room with the rag carpet and exposed beams and corner posts , and smiled only when the orchard boughs scratched at the leaded panes of the rear window .
the trees and the hills were close to him , and formed the gates of that timeless realm which was his true country .
then , when he was free , he felt in his blouse pocket for the key ; and being reassured , skipped off across the orchard to the rise beyond , where the wooded hill climbed again to heights above even the treeless knoll .
the floor of the forest was mossy and mysterious , and great lichened rocks rose vaguely here and there in the dim light like druid monoliths among the swollen and twisted trunks of a sacred grove .
once in his ascent randolph crossed a rushing stream whose falls a little way off sang runic incantations to the lurking fauns and aegipans and dryads .
then he came to the strange cave in the forest slope , the dreaded which country folk shunned , and away from which benijah had warned him again and again .
it was deep ; far deeper than anyone but randolph suspected , for the boy had found a fissure in the farthermost black corner that led to a loftier grotto beyond a haunting sepulchral place whose granite walls held a curious illusion of conscious artifice .
on this occasion he crawled in as usual , lighting his way with matches filched from the matchsafe , and edging through the final crevice with an eagerness hard to explain even to himself .
he could not tell why he approached the farther wall so confidently , or why he instinctively drew forth the great silver key as he did so .
but on he went , and when he danced back to the house that night he offered no excuses for his lateness , nor heeded in the least the reproofs he gained for ignoring the altogether .
now it is agreed by all the distant relatives of randolph carter that something occurred to heighten his imagination in his tenth year .
his cousin , ernest aspinwall , , of chicago , is fully ten years his senior ; and distinctly recalls a change in the boy after the autumn of .
randolph had looked on scenes of fantasy that few others can ever have beheld , and stranger still were some of the qualities which he showed in relation to very mundane things .
he seemed , in fine , to have picked up an odd gift of prophecy ; and reacted unusually to things which , though at the time without meaning , were later found to justify the singular impressions .
in subsequent decades as new inventions , new names , and new events appeared one by one in the book of history , people would now and then recall wonderingly how carter had years before let fall some careless word of undoubted connection with what was then far in the future .
he did not himself understand these words , or know why certain things made him feel certain emotions ; but fancied that some unremembered dream must be responsible .
it was as early as that he turned pale when some traveller mentioned the french town of , and friends remembered it when he was almost mortally wounded there in , while serving with the foreign legion in the great war .
carter relatives talk much of these things because he has lately disappeared .
his little old servant parks , who for years bore patiently with his vagaries , last saw him on the morning he drove off alone in his car with a key he had recently found .
parks had helped him get the key from the old box containing it , and had felt strangely affected by the grotesque carvings on the box , and by some other odd quality he could not name .
when carter left , he had said he was going to visit his old ancestral country around arkham .
half way up elm mountain , on the way to the ruins of the old carter place , they found his motor set carefully by the roadside ; and in it was a box of fragrant wood with carvings that frightened the countrymen who stumbled on it .
the box held only a queer parchment whose characters no linguist or palaeographer has been able to decipher or identify .
rain had long effaced any possible footprints , though boston investigators had something to say about evidences of disturbances among the fallen timbers of the carter place .
it was , they averred , as though someone had groped about the ruins at no distant period .
a common white handkerchief found among forest rocks on the hillside beyond can not be identified as belonging to the missing man .
there is talk of apportioning randolph carter estate among his heirs , but i shall stand firmly against this course because i do not believe he is dead .
there are twists of time and space , of vision and reality , which only a dreamer can divine ; and from what i know of carter i think he has merely found a way to traverse these mazes .
whether or not he will ever come back , i can not say .
he wanted the lands of dream he had lost , and yearned for the days of his childhood .
then he found a key , and i somehow believe he was able to use it to strange advantage .
i shall ask him when i see him , for i expect to meet him shortly in a certain we both used to haunt .
it is rumoured in ulthar , beyond the river skai , that a new king reigns on the opal throne of , that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny gnorri build their singular labyrinths , and i believe i know how to interpret this rumour .
certainly , i look forward impatiently to the sight of that great silver key , for in its cryptical arabesques there may stand symbolised all the aims and mysteries of a blindly impersonal cosmos .
i repeat to you , gentlemen , that your inquisition is fruitless .
detain me here forever if you will ; confine or execute me if you must have a victim to propitiate the illusion you call justice ; but i can say no more than i have said already .
everything that i can remember , i have told you with perfect candour .
nothing has been distorted or concealed , and if anything remains vague , it is only because of the dark cloud which has come over my mind that cloud and the nebulous nature of the horrors which brought it upon me .
again i say , i do not know what has become of harley warren , though i think almost hope that he is in peaceful oblivion , if there be anywhere so blessed a thing .
it is true that i have for five years been his closest friend , and a partial sharer of his terrible researches into the unknown .
i will not deny , though my memory is uncertain and indistinct , that this witness of yours may have seen us together as he says , on the gainsville pike , walking toward big cypress swamp , at half past on that awful night .
that we bore electric lanterns , spades , and a curious coil of wire with attached instruments , i will even affirm ; for these things all played a part in the single hideous scene which remains burned into my shaken recollection .
but of what followed , and of the reason i was found alone and dazed on the edge of the swamp next morning , i must insist that i know nothing save what i have told you over and over again .
you say to me that there is nothing in the swamp or near it which could form the setting of that frightful episode .
i reply that i knew nothing beyond what i saw .
vision or nightmare it may have been vision or nightmare i fervently hope it was yet it is all that my mind retains of what took place in those shocking hours after we left the sight of men .
and why harley warren did not return , he or his shade or some nameless thing i can not describe alone can tell .
as i have said before , the weird studies of harley warren were well known to me , and to some extent shared by me .
of his vast collection of strange , rare books on forbidden subjects i have read all that are written in the languages of which i am master ; but these are few as compared with those in languages i can not understand .
most , i believe , are in arabic ; and the book which brought on the end the book which he carried in his pocket out of the world was written in characters whose like i never saw elsewhere .
warren would never tell me just what was in that book .
as to the nature of our studies must i say again that i no longer retain full comprehension ?
it seems to me rather merciful that i do not , for they were terrible studies , which i pursued more through reluctant fascination than through actual inclination .
warren always dominated me , and sometimes i feared him .
i remember how i shuddered at his facial expression on the night before the awful happening , when he talked so incessantly of his theory , why certain corpses never decay , but rest firm and fat in their tombs for a thousand years .
but i do not fear him now , for i suspect that he has known horrors beyond my ken .
now i fear for him .
once more i say that i have no clear idea of our object on that night .
certainly , it had much to do with something in the book which warren carried with him that ancient book in undecipherable characters which had come to him from india a month before but i swear i do not know what it was that we expected to find .
your witness says he saw us at half past on the gainsville pike , headed for big cypress swamp .
this is probably true , but i have no distinct memory of it .
the picture seared into my soul is of one scene only , and the hour must have been long after midnight ; for a waning crescent moon was high in the vaporous heavens .
the place was an ancient cemetery ; so ancient that i trembled at the manifold signs of immemorial years .
it was in a deep , damp hollow , overgrown with rank grass , moss , and curious creeping weeds , and filled with a vague stench which my idle fancy associated absurdly with rotting stone .
on every hand were the signs of neglect and decrepitude , and i seemed haunted by the notion that warren and i were the first living creatures to invade a lethal silence of centuries .
over the valley rim a wan , waning crescent moon peered through the noisome vapors that seemed to emanate from unheard of catacombs , and by its feeble , wavering beams i could distinguish a repellent array of antique slabs , urns , cenotaphs , and mausoleum facades ; all crumbling , , and , and partly concealed by the gross luxuriance of the unhealthy vegetation .
my first vivid impression of my own presence in this terrible necropolis concerns the act of pausing with warren before a certain sepulcher and of throwing down some burdens which we seemed to have been carrying .
i now observed that i had with me an electric lantern and two spades , whilst my companion was supplied with a similar lantern and a portable telephone outfit .
no word was uttered , for the spot and the task seemed known to us ; and without delay we seized our spades and commenced to clear away the grass , weeds , and drifted earth from the flat , archaic mortuary .
after uncovering the entire surface , which consisted of three immense granite slabs , we stepped back some distance to survey the charnel scene ; and warren appeared to make some mental calculations .
then he returned to the sepulcher , and using his spade as a lever , sought to pry up the slab lying nearest to a stony ruin which may have been a monument in its day .
he did not succeed , and motioned to me to come to his assistance .
finally our combined strength loosened the stone , which we raised and tipped to one side .
the removal of the slab revealed a black aperture , from which rushed an effluence of miasmal gases so nauseous that we started back in horror .
after an interval , however , we approached the pit again , and found the exhalations less unbearable .
our lanterns disclosed the top of a flight of stone steps , dripping with some detestable ichor of the inner earth , and bordered by moist walls encrusted with niter .
and now for the first time my memory records verbal discourse , warren addressing me at length in his mellow tenor voice ; a voice singularly unperturbed by our awesome surroundings .
i sorry to have to ask you to stay on the surface , he said , but it would be a crime to let anyone with your frail nerves go down there .
you ca imagine , even from what you have read and from what i told you , the things i shall have to see and do .
it fiendish work , carter , and i doubt if any man without ironclad sensibilities could ever see it through and come up alive and sane .
i do wish to offend you , and heaven knows i be glad enough to have you with me ; but the responsibility is in a certain sense mine , and i could drag a bundle of nerves like you down to probable death or madness .
i tell you , you ca imagine what the thing is really like !
but i promise to keep you informed over the telephone of every move you see i enough wire here to reach to the center of the earth and back !
i can still hear , in memory , those coolly spoken words ; and i can still remember my remonstrances .
i seemed desperately anxious to accompany my friend into those sepulchral depths , yet he proved inflexibly obdurate .
at one time he threatened to abandon the expedition if i remained insistent ; a threat which proved effective , since he alone held the key to the thing .
all this i can still remember , though i no longer know what manner of thing we sought .
after he had obtained my reluctant acquiescence in his design , warren picked up the reel of wire and adjusted the instruments .
at his nod i took one of the latter and seated myself upon an aged , discolored gravestone close by the newly uncovered aperture .
then he shook my hand , shouldered the coil of wire , and disappeared within that indescribable ossuary .
for a minute i kept sight of the glow of his lantern , and heard the rustle of the wire as he laid it down after him ; but the glow soon disappeared abruptly , as if a turn in the stone staircase had been encountered , and the sound died away almost as quickly .
i was alone , yet bound to the unknown depths by those magic strands whose insulated surface lay green beneath the struggling beams of that waning crescent moon .
i constantly consulted my watch by the light of my electric lantern , and listened with feverish anxiety at the receiver of the telephone ; but for more than a quarter of an hour heard nothing .
then a faint clicking came from the instrument , and i called down to my friend in a tense voice .
apprehensive as i was , i was nevertheless unprepared for the words which came up from that uncanny vault in accents more alarmed and quivering than any i had heard before from harley warren .
he who had so calmly left me a little while previously , now called from below in a shaky whisper more portentous than the loudest shriek god !
if you could see what i am seeing !
i could not answer .
speechless , i could only wait .
then came the frenzied tones again carter , it terrible monstrous unbelievable !
this time my voice did not fail me , and i poured into the transmitter a flood of excited questions .
terrified , i continued to repeat , warren , what is it ?
what is it ?
once more came the voice of my friend , still hoarse with fear , and now apparently tinged with despair i ca tell you , carter !
it too utterly beyond thought i dare not tell you no man could know it and live great god !
i never dreamed of this !
stillness again , save for my now incoherent torrent of shuddering inquiry .
then the voice of warren in a pitch of wilder consternation carter !
for the love of god , put back the slab and get out of this if you can !
quick ! leave everything else and make for the outside it your only chance !
do as i say , and do ask me to explain !
i heard , yet was able only to repeat my frantic questions .
around me were the tombs and the darkness and the shadows ; below me , some peril beyond the radius of the human imagination .
but my friend was in greater danger than i , and through my fear i felt a vague resentment that he should deem me capable of deserting him under such circumstances .
more clicking , and after a pause a piteous cry from warren beat it !
for god sake , put back the slab and beat it , carter !
something in the boyish slang of my evidently stricken companion unleashed my faculties .
i formed and shouted a resolution , warren , brace up !
i coming down !
but at this offer the tone of my auditor changed to a scream of utter despair do !
you ca understand !
it too late and my own fault .
put back the slab and run there nothing else you or anyone can do now !
the tone changed again , this time acquiring a softer quality , as of hopeless resignation .
yet it remained tense through anxiety for me .
quick before it too late !
i tried not to heed him ; tried to break through the paralysis which held me , and to fulfil my vow to rush down to his aid .
but his next whisper found me still held inert in the chains of stark horror .
carter hurry !
it no use you must go better one than two the slab a pause , more clicking , then the faint voice of warren nearly over now do make it harder cover up those damned steps and run for your life you losing time so long , carter wo see you again .
here warren whisper swelled into a cry ; a cry that gradually rose to a shriek fraught with all the horror of the ages curse these hellish things legions my god !
beat it !
beat it !
!
after that was silence .
i know not how many interminable eons i sat stupefied ; whispering , muttering , calling , screaming into that telephone .
over and over again through those eons i whispered and muttered , called , shouted , and screamed , warren !
warren !
answer me are you there ?
and then there came to me the crowning horror of all the unbelievable , unthinkable , almost unmentionable thing .
i have said that eons seemed to elapse after warren shrieked forth his last despairing warning , and that only my own cries now broke the hideous silence .
but after a while there was a further clicking in the receiver , and i strained my ears to listen .
again i called down , warren , are you there ?
and in answer heard the thing which has brought this cloud over my mind .
i do not try , gentlemen , to account for that thing that voice nor can i venture to describe it in detail , since the first words took away my consciousness and created a mental blank which reaches to the time of my awakening in the hospital .
shall i say that the voice was deep ; hollow ; gelatinous ; remote ; unearthly ; inhuman ; disembodied ?
what shall i say ?
it was the end of my experience , and is the end of my story .
i heard it , and knew no more heard it as i sat petrified in that unknown cemetery in the hollow , amidst the crumbling stones and the falling tombs , the rank vegetation and the miasmal vapors heard it well up from the innermost depths of that damnable open sepulcher as i watched amorphous , necrophagous shadows dance beneath an accursed waning moon .
and this is what it said you fool , warren is !
now north of archaic kingsport the crags climb lofty and curious , terrace on terrace , till the northernmost hangs in the sky like a gray frozen .
alone it is , a bleak point jutting in limitless space , for there the coast turns sharp where the great miskatonic pours out of the plains past arkham , bringing woodland legends and little quaint memories of new england hills .
the of kingsport look up at that cliff as other look up at the pole star , and time the night watches by the way it hides or shows the great bear , cassiopeia and the dragon .
among them it is one with the firmament , and truly , it is hidden from them when the mist hides the stars or the sun .
some of the cliffs they love , as that whose grotesque profile they call father neptune , or that whose pillared steps they term the causeway ; but this one they fear because it is so near the sky .
the portuguese sailors coming in from a voyage cross themselves when they first see it , and the old yankees believe it would be a much graver matter than death to climb it , if indeed that were possible .
nevertheless there is an ancient house on that cliff , and at evening men see lights in the windows .
the ancient house has always been there , and people say one dwells within who talks with the morning mists that come up from the deep , and perhaps sees singular things oceanward at those times when the cliff rim becomes the rim of all earth , and solemn buoys toll free in the white aether of faery .
this they tell from hearsay , for that forbidding crag is always unvisited , and natives dislike to train telescopes on it .
summer boarders have indeed scanned it with jaunty binoculars , but have never seen more than the gray primeval roof , peaked and shingled , whose eaves come nearly to the gray foundations , and the dim yellow light of the little windows peeping out from under those eaves in the dusk .
these summer people do not believe that the same one has lived in the ancient house for hundreds of years , but can not prove their heresy to any real kingsporter .
even the terrible old man who talks to leaden pendulums in bottles , buys groceries with centuried spanish gold , and keeps stone idols in the yard of his antediluvian cottage in water street can only say these things were the same when his grandfather was a boy , and that must have been inconceivable ages ago , when belcher or shirley or pownall or bernard was governor of his majesty province of the .
then one summer there came a philosopher into kingsport .
his name was thomas olney , and he taught ponderous things in a college by narragansett bay .
with stout wife and romping children he came , and his eyes were weary with seeing the same things for many years , and thinking the same thoughts .
he looked at the mists from the diadem of father neptune , and tried to walk into their white world of mystery along the titan steps of the causeway .
morning after morning he would lie on the cliffs and look over the world rim at the cryptical aether beyond , listening to spectral bells and the wild cries of what might have been gulls .
then , when the mist would lift and the sea stand out prosy with the smoke of steamers , he would sigh and descend to the town , where he loved to thread the narrow olden lanes up and down hill , and study the crazy tottering gables and doorways which had sheltered so many generations of sturdy .
and he even talked with the terrible old man , who was not fond of strangers , and was invited into his fearsomely archaic cottage where low ceilings and wormy panelling hear the echoes of disquieting soliloquies in the dark small hours .
of course it was inevitable that olney should mark the gray unvisited cottage in the sky , on that sinister northward crag which is one with the mists and the firmament .
always over kingsport it hung , and always its mystery sounded in whispers through kingsport crooked alleys .
the terrible old man wheezed a tale that his father had told him , of lightning that shot one night up from that peaked cottage to the clouds of higher heaven ; and granny orne , whose tiny abode in ship street is all covered with moss and ivy , croaked over something her grandmother had heard at , about shapes that flapped out of the eastern mists straight into the narrow single door of that unreachable place for the door is set close to the edge of the crag toward the ocean , and glimpsed only from ships at sea .
at length , being avid for new strange things and held back by neither the kingsporter fear nor the summer boarder usual indolence , olney made a very terrible resolve .
despite a conservative training or because of it , for humdrum lives breed wistful longings of the unknown he swore a great oath to scale that avoided northern cliff and visit the abnormally antique gray cottage in the sky .
very plausibly his saner self argued that the place must be tenanted by people who reached it from inland along the easier ridge beside the miskatonic estuary .
probably they traded in arkham , knowing how little kingsport liked their habitation or perhaps being unable to climb down the cliff on the kingsport side .
olney walked out along the lesser cliffs to where the great crag leaped insolently up to consort with celestial things , and became very sure that no human feet could mount it or descend it on that beetling southern slope .
east and north it rose thousands of feet perpendicular from the water so only the western side , inland and toward arkham , remained .
one early morning in august olney set out to find a path to the inaccessible pinnacle .
he worked northwest along pleasant back roads , past hooper pond and the old brick to where the pastures slope up to the ridge above the miskatonic and give a lovely vista of arkham white georgian steeples across leagues of river and meadow .
here he found a shady road to arkham , but no trail at all in the seaward direction he wished .
woods and fields crowded up to the high bank of the river mouth , and bore not a sign of man presence ; not even a stone wall or a straying cow , but only the tall grass and giant trees and tangles of briars that the first indian might have seen .
as he climbed slowly east , higher and higher above the estuary on his left and nearer and nearer the sea , he found the way growing in difficulty till he wondered how ever the dwellers in that disliked place managed to reach the world outside , and whether they came often to market in arkham .
then the trees thinned , and far below him on his right he saw the hills and antique roofs and spires of kingsport .
even central hill was a dwarf from this height , and he could just make out the ancient graveyard by the congregational hospital beneath which rumor said some terrible caves or burrows lurked .
ahead lay sparse grass and scrub blueberry bushes , and beyond them the naked rock of the crag and the thin peak of the dreaded gray cottage .
now the ridge narrowed , and olney grew dizzy at his loneness in the sky , south of him the frightful precipice above kingsport , north of him the vertical drop of nearly a mile to the river mouth .
suddenly a great chasm opened before him , ten feet deep , so that he had to let himself down by his hands and drop to a slanting floor , and then crawl perilously up a natural defile in the opposite wall .
so this was the way the folk of the uncanny house journeyed betwixt earth and sky !
when he climbed out of the chasm a morning mist was gathering , but he clearly saw the lofty and unhallowed cottage ahead ; walls as gray as the rock , and high peak standing bold against the milky white of the seaward vapors .
and he perceived that there was no door on this landward end , but only a couple of small lattice windows with dingy panes leaded in seventeenth century fashion .
all around him was cloud and chaos , and he could see nothing below the whiteness of illimitable space .
he was alone in the sky with this queer and very disturbing house ; and when he sidled around to the front and saw that the wall stood flush with the cliff edge , so that the single narrow door was not to be reached save from the empty aether , he felt a distinct terror that altitude could not wholly explain .
and it was very odd that shingles so could survive , or bricks so crumbled still form a standing chimney .
as the mist thickened , olney crept around to the windows on the north and west and south sides , trying them but finding them all locked .
he was vaguely glad they were locked , because the more he saw of that house the less he wished to get in .
then a sound halted him .
he heard a lock rattle and a bolt shoot , and a long creaking follow as if a heavy door were slowly and cautiously opened .
this was on the oceanward side that he could not see , where the narrow portal opened on blank space thousands of feet in the misty sky above the waves .
then there was heavy , deliberate tramping in the cottage , and olney heard the windows opening , first on the north side opposite him , and then on the west just around the corner .
next would come the south windows , under the great low eaves on the side where he stood ; and it must be said that he was more than uncomfortable as he thought of the detestable house on one side and the vacancy of upper air on the other .
when a fumbling came in the nearer casements he crept around to the west again , flattening himself against the wall beside the now opened windows .
it was plain that the owner had come home ; but he had not come from the land , nor from any balloon or airship that could be imagined .
steps sounded again , and olney edged round to the north ; but before he could find a haven a voice called softly , and he knew he must confront his host .
stuck out of the west window was a great face whose eyes were phosphorescent with the imprint of sights .
but the voice was gentle , and of a quaint olden kind , so that olney did not shudder when a brown hand reached out to help him over the sill and into that low room of black oak wainscots and carved tudor furnishings .
the man was clad in very ancient garments , and had about him an unplaceable nimbus of and dreams of tall galleons .
olney does not recall many of the wonders he told , or even who he was ; but says that he was strange and kindly , and filled with the magic of unfathomed voids of time and space .
the small room seemed green with a dim aqueous light , and olney saw that the far windows to the east were not open , but shut against the misty aether with dull panes like the bottoms of old bottles .
that bearded host seemed young , yet looked out of eyes steeped in the elder mysteries ; and from the tales of marvelous ancient things he related , it must be guessed that the village folk were right in saying he had communed with the mists of the sea and the clouds of the sky ever since there was any village to watch his taciturn dwelling from the plain below .
and the day wore on , and still olney listened to rumors of old times and far places , and heard how the kings of atlantis fought with the slippery blasphemies that wriggled out of rifts in ocean floor , and how the pillared and weedy temple of poseidon is still glimpsed at midnight by lost ships , who knew by its sight that they are lost .
years of the titans were recalled , but the host grew timid when he spoke of the dim first age of chaos before the gods or even the elder ones were born , and when the other gods came to dance on the peak of in the stony desert near ulthar , beyond the river skai .
it was at this point that there came a knocking on the door ; that ancient door of oak beyond which lay only the abyss of white cloud .
olney started in fright , but the bearded man motioned him to be still , and tiptoed to the door to look out through a very small peephole .
what he saw he did not like , so pressed his fingers to his lips and tiptoed around to shut and lock all the windows before returning to the ancient settle beside his guest .
then olney saw lingering against the translucent squares of each of the little dim windows in succession a queer black outline as the caller moved inquisitively about before leaving ; and he was glad his host had not answered the knocking .
for there are strange objects in the great abyss , and the seeker of dreams must take care not to stir up or meet the wrong ones .
then the shadows began to gather ; first little furtive ones under the table , and then bolder ones in the dark panelled corners .
and the bearded man made enigmatical gestures of prayer , and lit tall candles in curiously wrought brass .
frequently he would glance at the door as if he expected someone , and at length his glance seemed answered by a singular rapping which must have followed some very ancient and secret code .
this time he did not even glance through the , but swung the great oak bar and shot the bolt , unlatching the heavy door and flinging it wide to the stars and the mist .
and then to the sound of obscure harmonies there floated into that room from the deep all the dreams and memories of earth sunken mighty ones .
and golden flames played about weedy locks , so that olney was dazzled as he did them homage .
neptune was there , and sportive tritons and fantastic nereids , and upon dolphins ' backs was balanced a vast crenulate shell wherein rode the gay and awful form of primal nodens , lord of the great abyss .
and the conchs of the tritons gave weird blasts , and the nereids made strange sounds by striking on the grotesque resonant shells of unknown lurkers in black seacaves .
then hoary nodens reached forth a wizened hand and helped olney and his host into the vast shell , whereat the conchs and the gongs set up a wild and awesome clamor .
and out into the limitless aether reeled that fabulous train , the noise of whose shouting was lost in the echoes of thunder .
all night in kingsport they watched that lofty cliff when the storm and the mists gave them glimpses of it , and when toward the small hours the little dim windows went dark they whispered of dread and disaster .
and olney children and stout wife prayed to the bland proper god of baptists , and hoped that the traveller would borrow an umbrella and rubbers unless the rain stopped by morning .
then dawn swam dripping and out of the sea , and the buoys tolled solemn in vortices of white aether .
and at noon elfin horns rang over the ocean as olney , dry and lightfooted , climbed down from the cliffs to antique kingsport with the look of far places in his eyes .
he could not recall what he had dreamed in the skyperched hut of that still nameless hermit , or say how he had crept down that crag untraversed by other feet .
nor could he talk of these matters at all save with the terrible old man , who afterward mumbled queer things in his long white beard ; vowing that the man who came down from that crag was not wholly the man who went up , and that somewhere under that gray peaked roof , or amidst inconceivable reaches of that sinister white mist , there lingered still the lost spirit of him who was thomas olney .
and ever since that hour , through dull dragging years of grayness and weariness , the philosopher has labored and eaten and slept and done uncomplaining the suitable deeds of a citizen .
not any more does he long for the magic of farther hills , or sigh for secrets that peer like green reefs from a bottomless sea .
the sameness of his days no longer gives him sorrow and thoughts have grown enough for his imagination .
his good wife waxes stouter and his children older and prosier and more useful , and he never fails to smile correctly with pride when the occasion calls for it .
in his glance there is not any restless light , and all he ever listens for solemn bells or far elfin horns it is only at night when old dreams are wandering .
he has never seen kingsport again , for his family disliked the funny old houses and complained that the drains were impossibly bad .
they have a trim bungalow now at bristol highlands , where no tall crags tower , and the neighbors are urban and modern .
but in kingsport strange tales are abroad , and even the terrible old man admits a thing untold by his grandfather .
for now , when the wind sweeps boisterous out of the north past the high ancient house that is one with the firmament , there is broken at last that ominous , brooding silence ever before the bane of kingsport maritime cotters .
and old folk tell of pleasing voices heard singing there , and of laughter that swells with joys beyond earth joys ; and say that at evening the little low windows are brighter than formerly .
they say , too , that the fierce aurora comes oftener to that spot , shining blue in the north with visions of frozen worlds while the crag and the cottage hang black and fantastic against wild coruscations .
and the mists of the dawn are thicker , and sailors are not quite so sure that all the muffled seaward ringing is that of the solemn buoys .
worst of all , though , is the shrivelling of old fears in the hearts of kingsport young men , who grow prone to listen at night to the north wind faint distant sounds .
they swear no harm or pain can inhabit that high peaked cottage , for in the new voices gladness beats , and with them the tinkle of laughter and music .
what tales the may bring to that haunted and northernmost pinnacle they do not know , but they long to extract some hint of the wonders that knock at the door when clouds are thickest .
and patriarchs dread lest some day one by one they seek out that inaccessible peak in the sky , and learn what centuried secrets hide beneath the steep shingled roof which is part of the rocks and the stars and the ancient fears of kingsport .
that those venturesome youths will come back they do not doubt , but they think a light may be gone from their eyes , and a will from their hearts .
and they do not wish quaint kingsport with its climbing lanes and archaic gables to drag listless down the years while voice by voice the laughing chorus grows stronger and wilder in that unknown and terrible eyrie where mists and the dreams of mists stop to rest on their way from the sea to the skies .
they do not wish the souls of their young men to leave the pleasant hearths and taverns of old kingsport , nor do they wish the laughter and song in that high rocky place to grow louder .
for as the voice which has come has brought fresh mists from the sea and from the north fresh lights , so do they say that still other voices will bring more mists and more lights , till perhaps the olden gods ( whose existence they hint only in whispers for fear the congregational parson shall hear may come out of the deep and from unknown kadath in the cold waste and make their dwelling on that evilly appropriate crag so close to the gentle hills and valleys of quiet , simple fisher folk .
this they do not wish , for to plain people things not of earth are unwelcome ; and besides , the terrible old man often recalls what olney said about a knock that the lone dweller feared , and a shape seen black and inquisitive against the mist through those queer translucent windows of leaded .
all these things , however , the elder ones only may decide ; and meanwhile the morning mist still comes up by that lovely vertiginous peak with the steep ancient house , that gray , house where none is seen but where evening brings furtive lights while the north wind tells of strange revels .
white and feathery it comes from the deep to its brothers the clouds , full of dreams of dank pastures and caves of leviathan .
and when tales fly thick in the grottoes of tritons , and conchs in seaweed cities blow wild tunes learned from the elder ones , then great eager vapors flock to heaven laden with lore ; and kingsport , nestling uneasy in its lesser cliffs below that awesome hanging sentinel of rock , sees oceanward only a mystic whiteness , as if the cliff rim were the rim of all earth , and the solemn bells of the buoys tolled free in the aether of faery .
men of strength and honour fashioned that street good valiant men of our blood who had come from the blessed isles across the sea .
at first it was but a path trodden by bearers of water from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach .
then , as more men came to the growing cluster of houses and looked about for places to dwell , they built cabins along the north side , cabins of stout oaken logs with masonry on the side toward the forest , for many indians lurked there with .
and in a few years more , men built cabins on the south side of the street .
up and down the street walked grave men in conical hats , who most of the time carried muskets or fowling pieces .
and there were also their bonneted wives and sober children .
in the evening these men with their wives and children would sit about gigantic hearths and read and speak .
very simple were the things of which they read and spoke , yet things which gave them courage and goodness and helped them by day to subdue the forest and till the fields .
and the children would listen and learn of the laws and deeds of old , and of that dear england which they had never seen or could not remember .
there was war , and thereafter no more indians troubled the street .
the men , busy with labour , waxed prosperous and as happy as they knew how to be .
and the children grew up comfortable , and more families came from the mother land to dwell on the street .
and the children children , and the newcomers ' children , grew up .
the town was now a city , and one by one the cabins gave place to houses simple , beautiful houses of brick and wood , with stone steps and iron railings and fanlights over the doors .
no flimsy creations were these houses , for they were made to serve many a generation .
within there were carven mantels and graceful stairs , and sensible , pleasing furniture , china , and silver , brought from the mother land .
so the street drank in the dreams of a young people and rejoiced as its dwellers became more graceful and happy .
where once had been only strength and honour , taste and learning now abode as well .
books and paintings and music came to the houses , and the young men went to the university which rose above the plain to the north .
in the place of conical hats and , of lace and snowy periwigs , there were cobblestones over which clattered many a blooded horse and rumbled many a gilded coach ; and brick sidewalks with horse blocks and .
there were in that street many trees elms and oaks and maples of dignity ; so that in the summer , the scene was all soft verdure and twittering .
and behind the houses were walled with hedged paths and sundials , where at evening the moon and stars would shine bewitchingly while fragrant blossoms glistened with dew .
so the street dreamed on , past wars , calamities , and change .
once , most of the young men went away , and some never came back .
that was when they furled the old flag and put up a new banner of stripes and stars .
but though men talked of great changes , the street felt them not , for its folk were still the same , speaking of the old familiar things in the old familiar accounts .
and the trees still sheltered singing birds , and at evening the moon and stars looked down upon dewy blossoms in the walled .
in time there were no more swords , hats , or periwigs in the street .
how strange seemed the inhabitants with their walking sticks , tall beavers , and cropped heads !
new sounds came from the distance first strange puffings and shrieks from the river a mile away , and then , many years later , strange puffings and shrieks and rumblings from other directions .
the air was not quite so pure as before , but the spirit of the place had not changed .
the blood and soul of their ancestors had fashioned the street .
nor did the spirit change when they tore open the earth to lay down strange pipes , or when they set up tall posts bearing weird wires .
there was so much ancient lore in that street , that the past could not easily be forgotten .
then came days of evil , when many who had known the street of old knew it no more , and many knew it who had not known it before , and went away , for their accents were coarse and strident , and their mien and faces unpleasing .
their thoughts , too , fought with the wise , just spirit of the street , so that the street pined silently as its houses fell into decay , and its trees died one by one , and its grew rank with weeds and waste .
but it felt a stir of pride one day when again marched forth young men , some of whom never came back .
these young men were clad in blue .
with the years , worse fortune came to the street .
its trees were all gone now , and its were displaced by the backs of cheap , ugly new buildings on parallel streets .
yet the houses remained , despite the ravages of the years and the storms and worms , for they had been made to serve many a generation .
new kinds of faces appeared in the street , swarthy , sinister faces with furtive eyes and odd features , whose owners spoke unfamiliar words and placed signs in known and unknown characters upon most of the musty houses .
crowded the gutters .
a sordid , undefinable stench settled over the place , and the ancient spirit slept .
great excitement once came to the street .
war and revolution were raging across the seas ; a dynasty had collapsed , and its degenerate subjects were flocking with dubious intent to the western land .
many of these took lodgings in the battered houses that had once known the songs of birds and the scent of roses .
then the western land itself awoke and joined the mother land in her titanic struggle for civilization .
over the cities once more floated the old flag , companioned by the new flag , and by a plainer , yet glorious tricolour .
but not many flags floated over the street , for therein brooded only fear and hatred and ignorance .
again young men went forth , but not quite as did the young men of those other days .
something was lacking .
and the sons of those young men of other days , who did indeed go forth in with the true spirit of their ancestors , went from distant places and knew not the street and its ancient spirit .
over the seas there was a great victory , and in triumph most of the young men returned .
those who had lacked something lacked it no longer , yet did fear and hatred and ignorance still brood over the street ; for many had stayed behind , and many strangers had come from distance places to the ancient houses .
and the young men who had returned dwelt there no longer .
swarthy and sinister were most of the strangers , yet among them one might find a few faces like those who fashioned the street and moulded its spirit .
like and yet unlike , for there was in the eyes of all a weird , unhealthy glitter as of greed , ambition , vindictiveness , or misguided zeal .
unrest and treason were abroad amongst an evil few who plotted to strike the western land its death blow , that they might mount to power over its ruins , even as assassins had mounted in that unhappy , frozen land from whence most of them had come .
and the heart of that plotting was in the street , whose crumbling houses teemed with alien makers of discord and echoed with the plans and speeches of those who yearned for the appointed day of blood , flame and crime .
of the various odd assemblages in the street , the law said much but could prove little .
with great diligence did men of hidden badges linger and listen about such places as petrovitch bakery , the squalid rifkin school of modern economics , the circle social club , and the liberty cafe .
there congregated sinister men in great numbers , yet always was their speech guarded or in a foreign tongue .
and still the old houses stood , with their forgotten lore of nobler , departed centuries ; of sturdy colonial tenants and dewy in the moonlight .
sometimes a lone poet or traveler would come to view them , and would try to picture them in their vanished glory ; yet of such travelers and poets there were not many .
the rumour now spread widely that these houses contained the leaders of a vast band of terrorists , who on a designated day were to launch an orgy of slaughter for the extermination of america and of all the fine old traditions which the street had loved .
handbills and papers fluttered about filthy gutters ; handbills and papers printed in many tongues and in many characters , yet all bearing messages of crime and rebellion .
in these writings the people were urged to tear down the laws and virtues that our fathers had exalted , to stamp out the soul of the old america the soul that was bequeathed through a thousand and a half years of freedom , justice , and moderation .
it was said that the swart men who dwelt in the street and congregated in its rotting edifices were the brains of a hideous revolution , that at their word of command many millions of brainless , besotted beasts would stretch forth their noisome talons from the slums of a thousand cities , burning , slaying , and destroying till the land of our fathers should be no more .
all this was said and repeated , and many looked forward in dread to the fourth day of july , about which the strange writings hinted much ; yet could nothing be found to place the guilt .
none could tell just whose arrest might cut off the damnable plotting at its source .
many times came bands of police to search the shaky houses , though at last they ceased to come ; for they too had grown tired of law and order , and had abandoned all the city to its fate .
then men in came , bearing muskets , till it seemed as if in its sad sleep the street must have some haunting dreams of those other days , when musketbearing men in conical hats walked along it from the woodland spring to the cluster of houses by the beach .
yet could no act be performed to check the impending cataclysm , for the swart , sinister men were old in cunning .
so the street slept uneasily on , till one night there gathered in petrovitch bakery , and the rifkin school of modern economics , and the circle social club , and liberty cafe , and in other places as well , vast hordes of men whose eyes were big with horrible triumph and expectation .
over hidden wires strange messages traveled , and much was said of still stranger messages yet to travel ; but most of this was not guessed till afterward , when the western land was safe from the peril .
the men in could not tell what was happening , or what they ought to do ; for the swart , sinister men were skilled in subtlety and concealment .
and yet the men in will always remember that night , and will speak of the street as they tell of it to their grandchildren ; for many of them were sent there toward morning on a mission unlike that which they had expected .
it was known that this nest of anarchy was old , and that the houses were tottering from the ravages of the years and the storms and worms ; yet was the happening of that summer night a surprise because of its very queer uniformity .
it was , indeed , an exceedingly singular happening , though after all , a simple one .
for without warning , in one of the small hours beyond midnight , all the ravages of the years and the storms and the worms came to a tremendous climax ; and after the crash there was nothing left standing in the street save two ancient chimneys and part of a stout brick wall .
nor did anything that had been alive come alive from the ruins .
a poet and a traveler , who came with the mighty crowd that sought the scene , tell odd stories .
the poet says that all through the hours before dawn he beheld sordid ruins indistinctly in the glare of the ; that there loomed above the wreckage another picture wherein he could describe moonlight and fair houses and elms and oaks and maples of dignity .
and the traveler declares that instead of the place wonted stench there lingered a delicate fragrance as of roses in full bloom .
but are not the dreams of poets and the tales of travelers notoriously false ?
there be those who say that things and places have souls , and there be those who say they have not ; i dare not say , myself , but i have told you of the street .
manuscript found on the coast of yucatan on august , , i , karl heinrich , graf von , in the imperial german navy and in charge of the submarine , deposit this bottle and record in the atlantic ocean at a point to me unknown but probably about latitude degrees , longitude degrees , where my ship lies disabled on the ocean floor .
i do so because of my desire to set certain unusual facts before the public ; a thing i shall not in all probability survive to accomplish in person , since the circumstances surrounding me are as menacing as they are extraordinary , and involve not only the hopeless crippling of the , but the impairment of my iron german will in a manner most disastrous .
on the afternoon of june , as reported by wireless to the , bound for kiel , we torpedoed the british freighter victory , new york to liverpool , in latitude degrees minutes , longitude degrees minutes ; permitting the crew to leave in boats in order to obtain a good cinema view for the admiralty records .
the ship sank quite picturesquely , bow first , the stem rising high out of the water whilst the hull shot down perpendicularly to the bottom of the sea .
our camera missed nothing , and i regret that so fine a reel of film should never reach berlin .
after that we sank the lifeboats with our guns and submerged .
when we rose to the surface about sunset , a seaman body was found on the deck , hands gripping the railing in curious fashion .
the poor fellow was young , rather dark , and very handsome ; probably an italian or greek , and undoubtedly of the victory crew .
he had evidently sought refuge on the very ship which had been forced to destroy his own one more victim of the unjust war of aggression which the english are waging upon the fatherland .
our men searched him for souvenirs , and found in his coat pocket a very odd bit of ivory carved to represent a youth head crowned with laurel .
my , lieutenant kienze , believed that the thing was of great age and artistic value , so took it from the men for himself .
how it had ever come into the possession of a common sailor neither he nor i could imagine .
as the dead man was thrown overboard there occurred two incidents which created much disturbance amongst the crew .
the fellow eyes had been closed ; but in the dragging of his body to the rail they were jarred open , and many seemed to entertain a queer delusion that they gazed steadily and mockingly at schmidt and zimmer , who were bent over the corpse .
the boatswain muller , an elderly man who would have known better had he not been a superstitious alsatian swine , became so excited by this impression that he watched the body in the water ; and swore that after it sank a little it drew its limbs into a swimming position and sped away to the south under the waves .
kienze and i did not like these displays of peasant ignorance , and severely reprimanded the men , particularly muller .
the next day a very troublesome situation was created by the indisposition of some of the crew .
they were evidently suffering from the nervous strain of our long voyage , and had had bad dreams .
several seemed quite dazed and stupid ; and after satisfying myself that they were not feigning their weakness , i excused them from their duties .
the sea was rather rough , so we descended to a depth where the waves were less troublesome .
here we were comparatively calm , despite a somewhat puzzling southward current which we could not identify from our oceanographic charts .
the moans of the sick men were decidedly annoying ; but since they did not appear to demoralize the rest of the crew , we did not resort to extreme measures .
it was our plan to remain where we were and intercept the liner dacia , mentioned in information from agents in new york .
in the early evening we rose to the surface , and found the sea less heavy .
the smoke of a battleship was on the northern horizon , but our distance and ability to submerge made us safe .
what worried us more was the talk of boatswain muller , which grew wilder as night came on .
he was in a detestably childish state , and babbled of some illusion of dead bodies drifting past the undersea portholes ; bodies which looked at him intensely , and which he recognized in spite of bloating as having seen dying during some of our victorious german exploits .
and he said that the young man we had found and tossed overboard was their leader .
this was very gruesome and abnormal , so we confined muller in irons and had him soundly whipped .
the men were not pleased at his punishment , but discipline was necessary .
we also denied the request of a delegation headed by seaman zimmer , that the curious carved ivory head be cast into the sea .
on june , seaman bohin and schmidt , who had been ill the day before , became violently insane .
i regretted that no physician was included in our complement of officers , since german lives are precious ; but the constant ravings of the two concerning a terrible curse were most subversive of discipline , so drastic steps were taken .
the crew accepted the event in a sullen fashion , but it seemed to quiet muller ; who thereafter gave us no trouble .
in the evening we released him , and he went about his duties silently .
in the week that followed we were all very nervous , watching for the dacia .
the tension was aggravated by the disappearance of muller and zimmer , who undoubtedly committed suicide as a result of the fears which had seemed to harass them , though they were not observed in the act of jumping overboard .
i was rather glad to be rid of muller , for even his silence had unfavorably affected the crew .
everyone seemed inclined to be silent now , as though holding a secret fear .
many were ill , but none made a disturbance .
lieutenant kienze chafed under the strain , and was annoyed by the merest trifle such as the school of dolphins which gathered about the in increasing numbers , and the growing intensity of that southward current which was not on our chart .
it at length became apparent that we had missed the dacia altogether .
such failures are not uncommon , and we were more pleased than disappointed , since our return to wilhelmshaven was now in order .
at noon june we turned northeastward , and despite some rather comical entanglements with the unusual masses of dolphins , were soon under way .
the explosion in the engine room at was wholly a surprise .
no defect in the machinery or carelessness in the men had been noticed , yet without warning the ship was racked from end to end with a colossal shock .
lieutenant kienze hurried to the engine room , finding the and most of the mechanism shattered , and engineers raabe and schneider instantly killed .
our situation had suddenly become grave indeed ; for though the chemical air regenerators were intact , and though we could use the devices for raising and submerging the ship and opening the hatches as long as compressed air and storage batteries might hold out , we were powerless to propel or guide the submarine .
to seek rescue in the would be to deliver ourselves into the hands of enemies unreasonably embittered against our great german nation , and our wireless had failed ever since the victory affair to put us in touch with a fellow of the imperial navy .
from the hour of the accident till july we drifted constantly to the south , almost without plans and encountering no vessel .
dolphins still encircled the , a somewhat remarkable circumstance considering the distance we had covered .
on the morning of july we sighted a warship flying american colors , and the men became very restless in their desire to surrender .
finally lieutenant menze had to shoot a seaman named traube , who urged this act with especial violence .
this quieted the crew for the time , and we submerged unseen .
the next afternoon a dense flock of appeared from the south , and the ocean began to heave ominously .
closing our hatches , we awaited developments until we realized that we must either submerge or be swamped in the mounting waves .
our air pressure and electricity were diminishing , and we wished to avoid all unnecessary use of our slender mechanical resources ; but in this case there was no choice .
we did not descend far , and when after several hours the sea was calmer , we decided to return to the surface .
here , however , a new trouble developed ; for the ship failed to respond to our direction in spite of all that the mechanics could do .
as the men grew more frightened at this undersea imprisonment , some of them began to mutter again about lieutenant kienze ivory image , but the sight of an automatic pistol calmed them .
we kept the poor devils as busy as we could , tinkering at the machinery even when we knew it was useless .
kienze and i usually slept at different times ; and it was during my sleep , about , july , that the general mutiny broke loose .
the six remaining pigs of seamen , suspecting that we were lost , had suddenly burst into a mad fury at our refusal to surrender to the yankee battleship two days before , and were in a delirium of cursing and destruction .
they roared like the animals they were , and broke instruments and furniture indiscriminately ; screaming about such nonsense as the curse of the ivory image and the dark dead youth who looked at them and swam away .
lieutenant kienze seemed paralyzed and inefficient , as one might expect of a soft , womanish rhinelander .
i shot all six men , for it was necessary , and made sure that none remained alive .
we expelled the bodies through the double hatches and were alone in the .
kienze seemed very nervous , and drank heavily .
it was decided that we remain alive as long as possible , using the large stock of provisions and chemical supply of oxygen , none of which had suffered from the crazy antics of those seamen .
our compasses , depth gauges , and other delicate instruments were ruined ; so that henceforth our only reckoning would be guess work , based on our watches , the calendar , and our apparent drift as judged by any objects we might spy through the portholes or from the conning tower .
fortunately we had storage batteries still capable of long use , both for interior lighting and for the searchlight .
we often cast a beam around the ship , but saw only dolphins , swimming parallel to our own drifting course .
i was scientifically interested in those dolphins ; for though the ordinary delphinus delphis is a cetacean mammal , unable to subsist without air , i watched one of the swimmers closely for two hours , and did not see him alter his submerged condition .
with the passage of time kienze and i decided that we were still drifting south , meanwhile sinking deeper and deeper .
we noted the marine fauna and flora , and read much on the subject in the books i had carried with me for spare moments .
i could not help observing , however , the inferior scientific knowledge of my companion .
his mind was not prussian , but given to imaginings and speculations which have no value .
the fact of our coming death affected him curiously , and he would frequently pray in remorse over the men , women , and children we had sent to the bottom ; forgetting that all things are noble which serve the german state .
after a time he became noticeably unbalanced , gazing for hours at his ivory image and weaving fanciful stories of the lost and forgotten things under the sea .
sometimes , as a psychological experiment , i would lead him on in the wanderings , and listen to his endless poetical quotations and tales of sunken ships .
i was very sorry for him , for i dislike to see a german suffer ; but he was not a good man to die with .
for myself i was proud , knowing how the fatherland would revere my memory and how my sons would be taught to be men like me .
on august , we espied the ocean floor , and sent a powerful beam from the searchlight over it .
it was a vast undulating plain , mostly covered with seaweed , and strewn with the shells of small mollusks .
here and there were slimy objects of puzzling contour , draped with weeds and encrusted with barnacles , which kienze declared must be ancient ships lying in their graves .
he was puzzled by one thing , a peak of solid matter , protruding above the oceanbed nearly four feet at its apex ; about two feet thick , with flat sides and smooth upper surfaces which met at a very obtuse angle .
i called the peak a bit of outcropping rock , but kienze thought he saw carvings on it .
after a while he began to shudder , and turned away from the scene as if frightened ; yet could give no explanation save that he was overcome with the vastness , darkness , remoteness , antiquity , and mystery of the oceanic abysses .
his mind was tired , but i am always a german , and was quick to notice two things that the was standing the pressure splendidly , and that the peculiar dolphins were still about us , even at a depth where the existence of high organisms is considered impossible by most naturalists .
that i had previously overestimated our depth , i was sure ; but none the less we must still have been deep enough to make these phenomena remarkable .
our southward speed , as gauged by the ocean floor , was about as i had estimated from the organisms passed at higher levels .
it was at , august , that poor kienze went wholly mad .
he had been in the conning tower using the searchlight when i saw him bound into the library compartment where i sat reading , and his face at once betrayed him .
i will repeat here what he said , underlining the words he emphasized he is calling !
he is calling !
i hear him !
we must go !
as he spoke he took his ivory image from the table , pocketed it , and seized my arm in an effort to drag me up the companionway to the deck .
in a moment i understood that he meant to open the hatch and plunge with me into the water outside , a vagary of suicidal and homicidal mania for which i was scarcely prepared .
as i hung back and attempted to soothe him he grew more violent , saying come now do not wait until later ; it is better to repent and be forgiven than to defy and be condemned .
then i tried the opposite of the soothing plan , and told him he was mad pitifully demented .
but he was unmoved , and cried if i am mad , it is mercy .
may the gods pity the man who in his callousness can remain sane to the hideous end !
come and be mad whilst he still calls with mercy !
this outburst seemed to relieve a pressure in his brain ; for as he finished he grew much milder , asking me to let him depart alone if i would not accompany him .
my course at once became clear .
he was a german , but only a rhinelander and a commoner ; and he was now a potentially dangerous madman .
by complying with his suicidal request i could immediately free myself from one who was no longer a companion but a menace .
i asked him to give me the ivory image before he went , but this request brought from him such uncanny laughter that i did not repeat it .
then i asked him if he wished to leave any keepsake or lock of hair for his family in germany in case i should be rescued , but again he gave me that strange laugh .
so as he climbed the ladder i went to the levers and , allowing proper , operated the machinery which sent him to his death .
after i saw that he was no longer in the boat i threw the searchlight around the water in an effort to obtain a last glimpse of him since i wished to ascertain whether the would flatten him as it theoretically should , or whether the body would be unaffected , like those extraordinary dolphins .
i did not , however , succeed in finding my late companion , for the dolphins were massed thickly and obscuringly about the conning tower .
that evening i regretted that i had not taken the ivory image surreptitiously from poor kienze pocket as he left , for the memory of it fascinated me .
i could not forget the youthful , beautiful head with its leafy crown , though i am not by nature an artist .
i was also sorry that i had no one with whom to converse .
kienze , though not my mental equal , was much better than no one .
i did not sleep well that night , and wondered exactly when the end would come .
surely , i had little enough chance of rescue .
the next day i ascended to the conning tower and commenced the customary searchlight explorations .
northward the view was much the same as it had been all the four days since we had sighted the bottom , but i perceived that the drifting of the was less rapid .
as i swung the beam around to the south , i noticed that the ocean floor ahead fell away in a marked declivity , and bore curiously regular blocks of stone in certain places , disposed as if in accordance with definite patterns .
the boat did not at once descend to match the greater ocean depth , so i was soon forced to adjust the searchlight to cast a sharply downward beam .
owing to the abruptness of the change a wire was disconnected , which necessitated a delay of many minutes for repairs ; but at length the light streamed on again , flooding the marine valley below me .
i am not given to emotion of any kind , but my amazement was very great when i saw what lay revealed in that electrical glow .
and yet as one reared in the best kultur of prussia , i should not have been amazed , for geology and tradition alike tell us of great transpositions in oceanic and continental areas .
what i saw was an extended and elaborate array of ruined edifices ; all of magnificent though unclassified architecture , and in various stages of preservation .
most appeared to be of marble , gleaming whitely in the rays of the searchlight , and the general plan was of a large city at the bottom of a narrow valley , with numerous isolated temples and villas on the steep slopes above .
roofs were fallen and columns were broken , but there still remained an air of immemorially ancient splendor which nothing could efface .
confronted at last with the atlantis i had formerly deemed largely a myth , i was the most eager of explorers .
at the bottom of that valley a river once had flowed ; for as i examined the scene more closely i beheld the remains of stone and marble bridges and , and terraces and embankments once verdant and beautiful .
in my enthusiasm i became nearly as idiotic and sentimental as poor kienze , and was very tardy in noticing that the southward current had ceased at last , allowing the to settle slowly down upon the sunken city as an airplane settles upon a town of the upper earth .
i was slow , to , in realizing that the school of unusual dolphins had vanished .
in about two hours the boat rested in a paved plaza close to the rocky wall of the valley .
on one side i could view the entire city as it sloped from the plaza down to the old ; on the other side , in startling proximity , i was confronted by the richly ornate and perfectly preserved facade of a great building , evidently a temple , hollowed from the solid rock .
of the original workmanship of this titanic thing i can only make conjectures .
the facade , of immense magnitude , apparently covers a continuous hollow recess ; for its windows are many and widely distributed .
in the center yawns a great open door , reached by an impressive flight of steps , and surrounded by exquisite carvings like the figures of bacchanals in relief .
foremost of all are the great columns and frieze , both decorated with sculptures of inexpressible beauty ; obviously portraying idealized pastoral scenes and processions of priests and priestesses bearing strange ceremonial devices in adoration of a radiant god .
the art is of the most phenomenal perfection , largely hellenic in idea , yet strangely individual .
it imparts an impression of terrible antiquity , as though it were the remotest rather than the immediate ancestor of greek art .
nor can i doubt that every detail of this massive product was fashioned from the virgin hillside rock of our planet .
it is palpably a part of the valley wall , though how the vast interior was ever excavated i can not imagine .
perhaps a cavern or series of caverns furnished the nucleus .
neither age nor submersion has corroded the pristine grandeur of this awful fane for fane indeed it must be and today after thousands of years it rests untarnished and inviolate in the endless night and silence of an .
i can not reckon the number of hours i spent in gazing at the sunken city with its buildings , arches , statues , and bridges , and the colossal temple with its beauty and mystery .
though i knew that death was near , my curiosity was consuming ; and i threw the searchlight beam about in eager quest .
the shaft of light permitted me to learn many details , but refused to show anything within the gaping door of the temple ; and after a time i turned off the current , conscious of the need of conserving power .
the rays were now perceptibly dimmer than they had been during the weeks of drifting .
and as if sharpened by the coming deprivation of light , my desire to explore the watery secrets grew .
i , a german , should be the first to tread those eon forgotten ways !
i produced and examined a diving suit of jointed metal , and experimented with the portable light and air regenerator .
though i should have trouble in managing the double hatches alone , i believed i could overcome all obstacles with my scientific skill and actually walk about the dead city in person .
on august i effected an exit from the , and laboriously made my way through the ruined and streets to the ancient river .
i found no skeletons or other human remains , but gleaned a wealth of archeological lore from sculptures and coins .
of this i can not now speak save to utter my awe at a culture in the full noon of glory when roamed europe and the nile flowed unwatched to the sea .
others , guided by this manuscript if it shall ever be found , must unfold the mysteries at which i can only hint .
i returned to the boat as my electric batteries grew feeble , resolved to explore the rock temple on the following day .
on the , as my impulse to search out the mystery of the temple waxed still more insistent , a great disappointment befell me ; for i found that the materials needed to replenish the portable light had perished in the mutiny of those pigs in july .
my rage was unbounded , yet my german sense forbade me to venture unprepared into an utterly black interior which might prove the lair of some indescribable marine monster or a labyrinth of passages from whose windings i could never extricate myself .
all i could do was to turn on the waning searchlight of the , and with its aid walk up the temple steps and study the exterior carvings .
the shaft of light entered the door at an upward angle , and i peered in to see if i could glimpse anything , but all in vain .
not even the roof was visible ; and though i took a step or two inside after testing the floor with a staff , i dared not go farther .
moreover , for the first time in my life i experienced the emotion of dread .
i began to realize how some of poor kienze moods had arisen , for as the temple drew me more and more , i feared its aqueous abysses with a blind and mounting terror .
returning to the submarine , i turned off the lights and sat thinking in the dark .
electricity must now be saved for emergencies .
saturday the i spent in total darkness , tormented by thoughts and memories that threatened to overcome my german will .
kienze had gone mad and perished before reaching this sinister remnant of a past unwholesomely remote , and had advised me to go with him .
was , indeed , fate preserving my reason only to draw me irresistibly to an end more horrible and unthinkable than any man has dreamed of ?
clearly , my nerves were sorely taxed , and i must cast off these impressions of weaker men .
i could not sleep saturday night , and turned on the lights regardless of the future .
it was annoying that the electricity should not last out the air and provisions .
i revived my thoughts of euthanasia , and examined my automatic pistol .
toward morning i must have dropped asleep with the lights on , for i awoke in darkness yesterday afternoon to find the batteries dead .
i struck several matches in succession , and desperately regretted the improvidence which had caused us long ago to use up the few candles we carried .
after the fading of the last match i dared to waste , i sat very quietly without a light .
as i considered the inevitable end my mind ran over preceding events , and developed a hitherto dormant impression which would have caused a weaker and more superstitious man to shudder .
the head of the radiant god in the sculptures on the rock temple is the same as that carven bit of ivory which the dead sailor brought from the sea and which poor kienze carried back into the sea .
i was a little dazed by this coincidence , but did not become terrified .
it is only the inferior thinker who hastens to explain the singular and the complex by the primitive shortcut of supernaturalism .
the coincidence was strange , but i was too sound a reasoner to connect circumstances which admit of no logical connection , or to associate in any uncanny fashion the disastrous events which had led from the victory affair to my present plight .
feeling the need of more rest , i took a sedative and secured some more sleep .
my nervous condition was reflected in my dreams , for i seemed to hear the cries of drowning persons , and to see dead faces pressing against the portholes of the boat .
and among the dead faces was the living , mocking face of the youth with the ivory image .
i must be careful how i record my awakening today , for i am unstrung , and much hallucination is necessarily mixed with fact .
psychologically my case is most interesting , and i regret that it can not be observed scientifically by a competent german authority .
upon opening my eyes my first sensation was an overmastering desire to visit the rock temple ; a desire which grew every instant , yet which i automatically sought to resist through some emotion of fear which operated in the reverse direction .
next there came to me the impression of light amidst the darkness of dead batteries , and i seemed to see a sort of phosphorescent glow in the water through the porthole which opened toward the temple .
this aroused my curiosity , for i knew of no deep sea organism capable of emitting such luminosity .
but before i could investigate there came a third impression which because of its irrationality caused me to doubt the objectivity of anything my senses might record .
it was an aural delusion ; a sensation of rhythmic , melodic sound as of some wild yet beautiful chant or choral hymn , coming from the outside through the absolutely sound proof hull of the .
convinced of my psychological and nervous abnormallty , i lighted some matches and poured a stiff dose of sodium bromide solution , which seemed to calm me to the extent of dispelling the illusion of sound .
but the phosphorescence remained , and i had difficulty in repressing a childish impulse to go to the porthole and seek its source .
it was horribly realistic , and i could soon distinguish by its aid the familiar objects around me , as well as the empty sodium bromide glass of which i had had no former visual impression in its present location .
this last circumstance made me ponder , and i crossed the room and touched the glass .
it was indeed in the place where i had seemed to see it .
now i knew that the light was either real or part of an hallucination so fixed and consistent that i could not hope to dispel it , so abandoning all resistance i ascended to the conning tower to look for the luminous agency .
might it not actually be another , offering possibilities of rescue ?
it is well that the reader accept nothing which follows as objective truth , for since the events transcend natural law , they are necessarily the subjective and unreal creations of my overtaxed mind .
when i attained the conning tower i found the sea in general far less luminous than i had expected .
there was no animal or vegetable phosphorescence about , and the city that sloped down to the river was invisible in blackness .
what i did see was not spectacular , not grotesque or terrifying , yet it removed my last vestige of trust in my consciousness .
for the door and windows of the undersea temple hewn from the rocky hill were vividly aglow with a flickering radiance , as from a mighty far within .
later incidents are chaotic .
as i stared at the uncannily lighted door and windows , i became subject to the most extravagant visions visions so extravagant that i can not even relate them .
i fancied that i discerned objects in the temple ; objects both stationary and moving ; and seemed to hear again the unreal chant that had floated to me when first i awaked .
and over all rose thoughts and fears which centered in the youth from the sea and the ivory image whose carving was duplicated on the frieze and columns of the temple before me .
i thought of poor kienze , and wondered where his body rested with the image he had carried back into the sea .
he had warned me of something , and i had not heeded but he was a rhinelander who went mad at troubles a prussian could bear with ease .
the rest is very simple .
my impulse to visit and enter the temple has now become an inexplicable and imperious command which ultimately can not be denied .
my own german will no longer controls my acts , and volition is henceforward possible only in minor matters .
such madness it was which drove kienze to his death , and unprotected in the ocean ; but i am a prussian and a man of sense , and will use to the last what little will i have .
when first i saw that i must go , i prepared my diving suit , helmet , and air regenerator for instant donning , and immediately commenced to write this hurried chronicle in the hope that it may some day reach the world .
i shall seal the manuscript in a bottle and entrust it to the sea as i leave the for ever .
i have no fear , not even from the prophecies of the madman kienze .
what i have seen can not be true , and i know that this madness of my own will at most lead only to suffocation when my air is gone .
the light in the temple is a sheer delusion , and i shall die calmly like a german , in the black and forgotten depths .
this demoniac laughter which i hear as i write comes only from my own weakening brain .
so i will carefully don my suit and walk boldly up the steps into the primal shrine , that silent secret of unfathomed waters and uncounted years .
the inhabitants of kingsport say and think many things about the terrible old man which generally keep him safe from the attention of gentlemen like ricci and his colleagues , despite the almost certain fact that he hides a fortune of indefinite magnitude somewhere about his musty and venerable abode .
he is , in truth , a very strange person , believed to have been a captain of east india clipper ships in his day ; so old that no one can remember when he was young , and so taciturn that few know his real name .
among the gnarled trees in the front yard of his aged and neglected place he maintains a strange collection of large stones , oddly grouped and painted so that they resemble the idols in some obscure eastern temple .
this collection frightens away most of the small boys who love to taunt the terrible old man about his long white hair and beard , or to break the small paned windows of his dwelling with wicked missiles ; but there are other things which frighten the older and more curious folk who sometimes steal up to the house to peer in through the dusty panes .
these folk say that on a table in a bare room on the ground floor are many peculiar bottles , in each a small piece of lead suspended from a string .
and they say that the terrible old man talks to these bottles , addressing them by such names as jack , scar face , long tom , spanish joe , peters , and mate ellis , and that whenever he speaks to a bottle the little lead pendulum within makes certain definite vibrations as if in answer .
those who have watched the tall , lean , terrible old man in these peculiar conversations , do not watch him again .
but angelo ricci and joe czanek and manuel silva were not of kingsport blood ; they were of that new and heterogeneous alien stock which lies outside the charmed circle of new england life and traditions , and they saw in the terrible old man merely a tottering , almost helpless , who could not walk without the aid of his knotted cane , and whose thin , weak hands shook pitifully .
they were really quite sorry in their way for the lonely , unpopular old fellow , whom everybody shunned , and at whom all the dogs barked singularly .
but business is business , and to a robber whose soul is in his profession , there is a lure and a challenge about a very old and very feeble man who has no account at the bank , and who pays for his few necessities at the village store with spanish gold and silver minted two centuries ago .
ricci , czanek , and silva selected the night of april for their call .
ricci and silva were to interview the poor old gentleman , whilst czanek waited for them and their presumable metallic burden with a covered in ship street , by the gate in the tall rear wall of their host grounds .
desire to avoid needless explanations in case of unexpected police intrusions prompted these plans for a quiet and unostentatious departure .
as prearranged , the three adventurers started out separately in order to prevent any suspicions afterward .
ricci and silva met in water street by the old man front gate , and although they did not like the way the moon shone down upon the painted stones through the budding branches of the gnarled trees , they had more important things to think about than mere idle superstition .
they feared it might be unpleasant work making the terrible old man loquacious concerning his hoarded gold and silver , for aged sea captains are notably stubborn and perverse .
still , he was very old and very feeble , and there were two visitors .
ricci and silva were experienced in the art of making unwilling persons voluble , and the screams of a weak and exceptionally venerable man can be easily muffled .
so they moved up to the one lighted window and heard the terrible old man talking childishly to his bottles with pendulums .
then they donned masks and knocked politely at the oaken door .
waiting seemed very long to czanek as he fidgeted restlessly in the covered by the terrible old man back gate in ship street .
he was more than ordinarily , and he did not like the hideous screams he had heard in the ancient house just after the hour appointed for the deed .
had he not told his colleagues to be as gentle as possible with the pathetic old ?
very nervously he watched that narrow oaken gate in the high and stone wall .
frequently he consulted his watch , and wondered at the delay .
had the old man died before revealing where his treasure was hidden , and had a thorough search become necessary ?
czanek did not like to wait so long in the dark in such a place .
then he sensed a soft tread or tapping on the walk inside the gate , heard a gentle fumbling at the rusty latch , and saw the narrow , heavy door swing inward .
and in the pallid glow of the single dim he strained his eyes to see what his colleagues had brought out of that sinister house which loomed so close behind .
but when he looked , he did not see what he had expected ; for his colleagues were not there at all , but only the terrible old man leaning quietly on his knotted cane and smiling hideously .
czanek had never before noticed the colour of that man eyes ; now he saw that they were yellow .
little things make considerable excitement in little towns , which is the reason that kingsport people talked all that spring and summer about the three unidentifiable bodies , horribly slashed as with many cutlasses , and horribly mangled as by the tread of many cruel , which the tide washed in .
and some people even spoke of things as trivial as the deserted found in ship street , or certain especially inhuman cries , probably of a stray animal or migratory bird , heard in the night by wakeful citizens .
but in this idle village gossip the terrible old man took no interest at all .
he was by nature reserved , and when one is aged and feeble , one reserve is doubly strong .
besides , so ancient a must have witnessed scores of things much more stirring in the days of his unremembered youth .
the thing on the doorstep i v i it is true that i have sent six bullets through the head of my best friend , and yet i hope to show by this statement that i am not his murderer .
at first i shall be called a madman madder than the man i shot in his cell at the arkham sanitarium .
later some of my readers will weigh each statement , correlate it with the known facts , and ask themselves how i could have believed otherwise than i did after facing the evidence of that horror that thing on the doorstep .
until then i also saw nothing but madness in the wild tales i have acted on .
even now i ask myself whether i was misled or whether i am not mad after all .
i do not know but others have strange things to tell of edward and asenath derby , and even the stolid police are at their wits ' ends to account for that last terrible visit .
they have tried weakly to concoct a theory of a ghastly jest or warning by discharged servants , yet they know in their hearts that the truth is something infinitely more terrible and incredible .
so i say that i have not murdered edward derby .
rather have i avenged him , and in so doing purged the earth of a horror whose survival might have loosed untold terrors on all mankind .
there are black zones of shadow close to our daily paths , and now and then some evil soul breaks a passage through .
when that happens , the man who knows must strike before reckoning the consequences .
i have known edward pickman derby all his life .
eight years my junior , he was so precocious that we had much in common from the time he was eight and i was sixteen .
he was the most phenomenal child scholar i have ever known , and at seven was writing verse of a sombre , fantastic , almost morbid cast which astonished the tutors surrounding him .
perhaps his private education and coddled seclusion had something to do with his premature flowering .
an only child , he had organic weaknesses which startled his doting parents and caused them to keep him closely chained to their side .
he was never allowed out without his nurse , and seldom had a chance to play unconstrainedly with other children .
all this doubtless fostered a strange secretive life in the boy , with imagination as his one avenue of freedom .
at any rate , his juvenile learning was prodigious and bizarre ; and his facile writings such as to captivate me despite my greater age .
about that time i had leanings toward art of a somewhat grotesque cast , and i found in this younger child a rare kindred spirit .
what lay behind our joint love of shadows and marvels was , no doubt , the ancient , mouldering , and subtly fearsome town in which we live , arkham , whose huddled , sagging gambrel roofs and crumbling georgian balustrades brood out the centuries beside the darkly muttering miskatonic .
as time went by i turned to architecture and gave up my design of illustrating a book of edward demoniac poems , yet our comradeship suffered no lessening .
young derby odd genius developed remarkably , and in his eighteenth year his collected made a real sensation when issued under the title azathoth and other horrors .
he was a close correspondent of the notorious baudelairean poet justin geoffrey , who wrote the people of the monolith and died screaming in a madhouse in after a visit to a sinister , village in hungary .
in and practical affairs , however , derby was greatly retarded because of his coddled existence .
his health had improved , but his habits of childish dependence were fostered by parents , so that he never travelled alone , made independent decisions , or assumed responsibilities .
it was early seen that he would not be equal to a struggle in the business or professional arena , but the family fortune was so ample that this formed no tragedy .
as he grew to years of manhood he retained a deceptive aspect of boyishness .
blond and , he had the fresh complexion of a child ; and his attempt to raise a moustache were discernible only with difficulty .
his voice was soft and light , and his unexercised life gave him a juvenile chubbiness rather than the paunchiness of premature middle age .
he was of good height , and his handsome face would have made him a notable gallant had not his shyness held him to seclusion and bookishness .
derby parents took him abroad every summer , and he was quick to seize on the surface aspects of european thought and expression .
his talents turned more and more toward the decadent , and other artistic sensitiveness and yearnings were in him .
we had great discussions in those days .
i had been through harvard , had studied in a boston architect office , had married , and had finally returned to arkham to practise my profession settling in the family homestead in saltonstall street since my father had moved to florida for his health .
edward used to call almost every evening , till i came to regard him as one of the household .
he had a characteristic way of ringing the doorbell or sounding the knocker that grew to be a veritable code signal , so that after dinner i always listened for the familiar three brisk strokes followed by two more after a pause .
less frequently i would visit at his house and note with envy the obscure volumes in his constantly growing library .
derby went through miskatonic university in arkahm since his parents would not let him board away from them .
he entered at sixteen and completed his course in three years , majoring in english and french literature and receiving high marks in everything but mathematics and the sciences .
he mingled very little with the other students , though looking enviously at the daring or bohemian set whose superficially smart language and meaningless ironic pose he aped , and whose dubious conduct he wished he dared adopt .
what he did do was to become an almost fanatical devotee of subterranean magical lore , for which miskatonic library was and is famous .
always a dweller on the surface of phantasy and strangeness , he now delved deep into the actual runes and riddles left by a fabulous past for the guidance or puzzlement of posterity .
he read things like the frightful book of eibon , the unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt , and the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , though he did not tell his parents he had seen them .
edward was twenty when my son and only child was born , and seemed pleased when i named the newcomer edward derby upton after him .
by the time he was edward derby was a prodigiously learned man and a fairly well known poet and fantaisiste though his lack of contacts and responsibilities had slowed down his literary growth by making his products derivative and .
i was perhaps his closest friend finding him an inexhaustible mine of vital theoretical topics , while he relied on me for advice in whatever matters he did not wish to refer to his parents .
he remained single more through shyness , inertia , and parental protectiveness than through inclination and moved in society only to the slightest and most perfunctory extent .
when the war came both health and ingrained timidity kept him at home .
i went to plattsburg for a commission but never got overseas .
so the years wore on .
edward mother died when he was and for months he was incapacitated by some odd psychological malady .
his father took him to europe , however , and he managed to pull out of his trouble without visible effects .
afterward he seemed to feel a sort of grotesque exhilaration , as if of partial escape from some unseen bondage .
he began to mingle in the more advanced college set despite his middle age , and was present at some extremely wild doings on one occasion paying heavy blackmail ( which he borrowed of me ) to keep his presence at a certain affair from his father notice .
some of the whispered rumors about the wild miskatonic set were extremely singular .
there was even talk of black magic and of happenings utterly beyond credibility .
edward was when he met asenath waite .
she was , i judge , about at the time ; and was taking a special course in mediaeval metaphysics at miskatonic .
the daughter of a friend of mine had met her before in the hall school at kingsport and had been inclined to shun her because of her odd reputation .
she was dark , smallish , and very except for overprotuberant eyes ; but something in her expression alienated extremely sensitive people .
it was , however , largely her origin and conversation which caused average folk to avoid her .
she was one of the innsmouth waites , and dark legends have clustered for generations about crumbling , innsmouth and its people .
there are tales of horrible bargains about the year , and of a strange element not quite human in the ancient families of the fishing port tales such as only old time yankees can devise and repeat with proper awesomeness .
asenath case was aggravated by the fact that she was ephraim waite daughter the child of his old age by an unknown wife who always went veiled .
ephraim lived in a mansion in washington street , innsmouth , and those who had seen the place ( arkham folk avoid going to innsmouth whenever they can ) declared that the attic windows were always boarded , and that strange sounds sometimes floated from within as evening drew on .
the old man was known to have been a prodigious magical student in his day , and legend averred that he could raise or quell storms at sea according to his whim .
i had seen him once or twice in my youth as he came to arkham to consult forbidden tomes at the college library , and had hated his wolfish , saturnine face with its tangle of beard .
he had died insane under rather queer circumstances just before his daughter ( by his will made a nominal ward of the principal ) entered the hall school , but she had been his morbidly avid pupil and looked fiendishly like him at times .
the friend whose daughter had gone to school with asenath waite repeated many curious things when the news of edward acquaintance with her began to spread about .
asenath , it seemed , had posed as a kind of magician at school ; and had really seemed able to accomplish some highly baffling marvels .
she professed to be able to raise thunderstorms , though her seeming success was generally laid to some uncanny knack at prediction .
all animals markedly disliked her , and she could make any dog howl by certain motions of her right hand .
there were times when she displayed snatches of knowledge and language very singular and very shocking for a young girl ; when she would frighten her schoolmates with leers and winks of an inexplicable kind , and would seem to extract an obscene zestful irony from her present situation .
most unusual , though , were the cases of her influence over other persons .
she was , beyond question , a genuine hypnotist .
by gazing peculiarly at a she would often give the latter a distinct feeling of exchanged personality as if the subject were placed momentarily in the magician body and able to stare half across the room at her real body , whose eyes blazed and protruded with an alien expression .
asenath often made wild claims about the nature of consciousness and about its independence of the physical frame or at least from the of the physical frame .
her crowning rage , however , was that she was not a man ; since she believed a male brain had certain unique and cosmic powers .
given a man brain , she declared , she could not only equal but surpass her father in mastery of unknown forces .
edward met asenath at a gathering of intelligentsia held in one of the students ' rooms , and could talk of nothing else when he came to see me the next day .
he had found her full of the interests and erudition which engrossed him most , and was in addition wildly taken with her appearance .
i had never seen the young woman , and recalled casual references only faintly , but i knew who she was .
it seemed rather regrettable that derby should become so upheaved about her ; but i said nothing to discourage him , since infatuation thrives on opposition .
he was not , he said , mentioning her to his father .
in the next few weeks i heard of very little but asenath from young derby .
others now remarked edward autumnal gallantry , though they agreed that he did not look even nearly his actual age , or seem at all inappropriate as an escort for his bizarre divinity .
he was only a trifle paunchy despite his indolence and , and his face was absolutely without lines .
asenath , on the other hand , had the premature crow feet which come from the exercises of an intense will .
about this time edward brought the girl to call on me , and i at once saw that his interest was by no means .
she eyed him continually with an almost predatory air , and i perceived that their intimacy was beyond untangling .
soon afterward i had a visit from old derby , whom i had always admired and respected .
he had heard the tales of his son new friendship , and had wormed the whole truth out of the boy .
edward meant to marry asenath , and had even been looking at houses in the suburbs .
knowing my usually great influence with his son , the father wondered if i could help to break the affair off ; but i regretfully expressed my doubts .
this time it was not a question of edward weak will but of the woman strong will .
the perennial child had transferred his dependence from the parental image to a new and stronger image , and nothing could be done about it .
the wedding was performed a month later by a justice of the peace , according to the bride request .
derby , at my advice , offered no opposition , and he , my wife , my son , and i attended the brief ceremony the other guests being wild young people from the college .
asenath had bought the old crowninshield place in the country at the end of high street , and they proposed to settle there after a short trip to innsmouth , whence three servants and some books and household goods were to be brought .
it was probably not so much consideration for edward and his father as a personal wish to be near the college , its library , and its crowd of sophisticates , that made asenath settle in arkham instead of returning permanently home .
when edward called on me after the honeymoon i thought he looked slightly changed .
asenath had made him get rid of the undeveloped moustache , but there was more than that .
he looked soberer and more thoughtful , his habitual pout of childish rebelliousness being exchanged for a look almost of genuine sadness .
i was puzzled to decide whether i liked or disliked the change .
certainly he seemed for the moment more normally adult than ever before .
perhaps the marriage was a good thing might not the change of dependence form a start toward actual neutralisaton , leading ultimately to responsible independence ?
he came alone , for asenath was very busy .
she had brought a vast store of books and apparatus from innsmouth ( derby shuddered as he spoke the name ) , and was finishing the restoration of the crowninshield house and grounds .
her home in that town was a rather disgusting place , but certain objects in it had taught him some surprising things .
he was progressing fast in esoteric lore now that he had asenath guidance .
some of the experiments she proposed were very daring and radical he did not feel at liberty to describe them but he had confidence in her powers and intentions .
the three servants were very queer an incredibly aged couple who had been with old ephraim and referred occasionally to him and to asenath dead mother in a cryptic way , and a swarthy young wench who had marked anomalies of feature and seemed to exude a perpetual odour of fish .
for the next two years i saw less and less of derby .
a fortnight would sometimes slip by without the familiar strokes at the front door ; and when he did call or when , as happened with increasing infrequency , i called on him he was very little disposed to converse on vital topics .
he had become secretive about those occult studies which he used to describe and discuss so minutely , and preferred not to talk of his wife .
she had aged tremendously since her marriage , till now oddly enough she seemed the elder of the two .
her face held the most concentratedly determined expression i had ever seen , and her whole aspect seemed to gain a vague , unplaceable repulsiveness .
my wife and son noticed it as much as i , and we all ceased gradually to call on her for which , edward admitted in one of his boyishly tactless moments , she was unmitigatedly grateful .
occasionally the derbys would go on long trips ostensibly to europe , though edward sometimes hinted at obscurer destinations .
it was after the first year that people began talking about the change in edward derby .
it was very casual talk , for the change was purely psychological ; but it brought up some interesting points .
now and then , it seemed edward was observed to wear an expression and to do things wholly incompatible with his usual flabby nature .
for example although in the old days he could not drive a car , he was now seen occasionally to dash into or out of the old crowninshield driveway with asenath powerful packard , handling it like a master , and meeting traffic entanglements with a skill and determination utterly alien to his accustomed nature .
in such cases he seemed always to be just back from some trip or just starting on one what sort of trip , no one could guess , although he mostly favoured the innsmouth road .
oddly , the metamorphosis did not seem altogether pleasing .
people said he looked too much like his wife , or like old ephraim waite himself , in these moments or perhaps these moments seemed unnatural because they were so rare .
sometimes , hours after starting out in this way , he would return listlessly sprawled on the rear seat of the car while an obviously hired chauffeur or mechanic drove .
also , his preponderant aspect on the streets during his decreasing round of social contacts ( including , i may say , his calls on me ) was the indecisive one its irresponsible childishness even more marked than in the past .
while asenath face aged , edward aside from those exceptional occasions actually relaxed into a kind of exaggerated immaturity , save when a trace of the new sadness or understanding would flash across it .
it was really very puzzling .
meanwhile the derbys almost dropped out of the gay college circle not through their own disgust , we heard , but because something about their present studies shocked even the most callous of the other decadents .
it was in the third year of the marriage that edward began to hint openly to me of a certain fear and dissatisfaction .
he would let fall remarks about things going too far , and would talk darkly about the need of gaining his identity .
at first i ignored such references , but in time i began to question him guardedly , remembering what my friend daughter had said about asenath hypnotic influence over the other girls at school the cases where students had thought they were in her body looking across the room at themselves .
this questioning seemed to make him at once alarmed and grateful , and once he mumbled something about having a serious talk with me later .
about this time old derby died , for which i was afterward very thankful .
edward was badly upset , though by no means disorganized .
he had seen astonishingly little of his parent since his marriage , for asenath had concentrated in herself all his vital sense of family linkage .
some called him callous in his loss especially since those jaunty and confident moods in the car began to increase .
he now wished to move back into the old family mansion , but asenath insisted on staying in the crowninshield house to which she had become well adjusted .
not long afterward my wife heard a curious thing from a friend one of the few who had not dropped the derbys .
she had been out to the end of high street to call on the couple , and had seen a car shoot briskly out of the drive with edward oddly confident and almost sneering face above the wheel .
ringing the bell , she had been told by the repulsive wench that asenath was also out ; but had chanced to look at the house in leaving .
there , at one of edward library windows , she had glimpsed a hastily withdrawn face a face whose expression of pain , defeat , and wistful hopelessness was poignant beyond description .
it was incredibly enough in view of its usual domineering cast asenath ; yet the caller had vowed that in that instant the sad , muddled eyes of poor edward were gazing out from it .
edward calls now grew a trifle more frequent , and his hints occasionally became concrete .
what he said was not to be believed , even in centuried and arkham ; but he threw out his dark lore with a sincerity and convincingness which made one fear for his sanity .
he talked about terrible meetings in lonely places , of cyclopean ruins in the heart of the maine woods beneath which vast staircases led down to abysses of nighted secrets , of complex angles that led through invisible walls to other regions of space and time , and of hideous exchanges of personality that permitted explorations in remote and forbidden places , on other worlds , and in different space time continua .
he would now and then back up certain crazy hints by exhibiting objects which utterly nonplussed me elusively coloured and bafflingly textured objects like nothing ever heard of on earth , whose insane curves and surfaces answered no conceivable purpose , and followed no conceivable geometry .
these things , he said , came from outside ; and his wife knew how to get them .
sometimes but always in frightened and ambiguous whisper he would suggest things about old ephraim waite , whom he had seen occasionally at the college library in the old days .
these adumbrations were never specific , but seemed to revolve around some especially horrible doubt as to whether the old wizard were really dead in a spiritual as well as corporeal sense .
at times derby would halt abruptly in his revelations , and i wondered whether asenath could possibly have divined his speech at a distance and cut him off through some unknown sort of telepathic mesmerism some power of the kind she had displayed at school .
certainly , she suspected that he told me things , for as the weeks passed she tried to stop his visits with words and glances of a most inexplicable potency .
only with difficulty could he get to see me , for although he would pretend to be going somewhere else , some invisible force would generally clog his motions or make him forget his destination for the time being .
his visits usually came when asenath was way away in her own body , as he once oddly put it .
she always found out later the servants watched his goings and coming but evidently she thought it inexpedient to do anything drastic .
derby had been married more than three years on that august day when i got that telegram from maine .
i had not seen him for two months , but had heard he was away on business .
asenath was supposed to be with him , though watchful gossip declared there was someone upstairs in the house behind the doubly curtained windows .
they had watched the purchases made by the servants .
and now the town marshal of chesuncook had wired of the draggled madman who stumbled out of the woods with delirious ravings and screamed to me for protection .
it was edward and he had been just able to recall his own name and address .
chesuncook is close to the wildest , deepest , and least explored forest belt in maine , and it took a whole day of feverish jolting through fantastic and forbidding scenery to get there in a car .
i found derby in a cell at the town farm , vacillating between frenzy and apathy .
he knew me at once , and began pouring out a meaningless , torrent of words in my direction .
dan , for god sake !
the pit of the shoggoths !
down the six thousand steps the abomination of abominations i never would let her take me , and then i found myself there ia !
! the shape rose up from the altar , and there were five hundred that howled the hooded thing bleated !
kamog ! '
that was old ephraim secret name in the coven i was there , where she promised she would take me a minute before i was locked in the library , and then i was there where she had gone with my body in the place of utter blasphemy , the unholy pit where the black realm begins and the watcher guards the gate i saw a shoggoth it changed shape i ca stand it i kill her if she ever sends me there again i kill that entity her , him , it i kill it !
i kill it with my own hands !
it took me an hour to quiet him , but he subsided at last .
the next day i got him decent clothes in the village , and set out with him for arkham .
his fury of hysteria was spent , and he was inclined to be silent , though he began muttering darkly to himself when the car passed through augusta as if the sight of a city aroused unpleasant memories .
it was clear that he did not wish to go home ; and considering the fantastic delusions he seemed to have about his wife delusions undoubtedly springing from some actual hypnotic ordeal to which he had been subjected i thought it would be better if he did not .
i would , i resolved , put him up myself for a time ; no matter what unpleasantness it would make with asenath .
later i would help him get a divorce , for most assuredly there were mental factors which made this marriage suicidal for him .
when we struck open country again derby muttering faded away , and i let him nod and drowse on the seat beside me as i drove .
during our sunset dash through portland the muttering commenced again , more distinctly than before , and as i listened i caught a stream of utterly insane drivel about asenath .
the extent to which she had preyed on edward nerves was plain , for he had woven a whole set of hallucinations around her .
his present predicament , he mumbled furtively , was only one of a long series .
she was getting hold of him , and he knew that some day she would never let go .
even now she probably let him go only when she had to , because she could hold on long at a time .
she constantly took his body and went to nameless places for nameless rites , leaving him in her body and locking him upstairs but sometimes she could hold on , and he would find himself suddenly in his own body again in some , horrible , and perhaps unknown place .
sometimes she get hold of him again and sometimes she could .
often he was left stranded somewhere as i had found him time and again he had to find his way home from frightful distances , getting somebody to drive the car after he found it .
the worst thing was that she was holding on to him longer and longer at a time .
she wanted to be a man to be fully human that was why she got hold of him .
she had sensed the mixture of brain and weak will in him .
some day she would crowd him out and disappear with his body disappear to become a great magician like her father and leave him marooned in that female shell that was even quite human .
yes , he knew about the innsmouth blood now .
there had been traffick with things from the sea it was horrible and old ephraim he had known the secret , and when he grew old did a hideous thing to keep alive he wanted to live forever asenath would succeed one successful demonstration had taken place already .
as derby muttered on i turned to look at him closely , verifying the impression of change which an earlier scrutiny had given me .
paradoxically , he seemed in better shape than usual harder , more normally developed , and without the trace of sickly flabbiness caused by his indolent habits .
it was as if he had been really active and properly exercised for the first time in his coddled life , and i judged that asenath force must have pushed him into unwonted channels of motion and alertness .
but just now his mind was in a pitiable state ; for he was mumbling wild extravagances about his wife , about black magic , about old ephraim , and about some revelation which would convince even me .
he repeated names which i recognized from bygone browsings in forbidden volumes , and at times made me shudder with a certain thread of mythological consistency or convincing coherence which ran through his maundering .
again and again he would pause , as if to gather courage for some final and terrible disclosure .
dan , dan , do you remember him wild eyes and the unkempt beard that never turned white ?
he glared at me once , and i never forgot it .
now she glares that way .
and i know why !
he found it in the necronomicon the formula .
i do dare tell you the page yet , but when i do you can read and understand .
then you will know what has engulfed me .
on , on , on , on body to body to body he means never to die .
the he knows how to break the link it can flicker on a while even when the body is dead .
i give you hints and maybe you guess .
listen , dan do you know why my wife always takes such pains with that silly backhand writing ?
have you ever seen a manuscript of old ephraim ?
do you want to know why i shivered when i saw some hasty notes asenath had jotted down ?
asenath is there such a person ?
why did they there was poison in old ephraim stomach ?
why do the gilmans whisper about the way he shrieked like a frightened child when he went mad and asenath locked him up in the padded attic room where the other had been ?
was it old ephraim soul that was locked in ?
who locked in whom ?
why had he been looking for months for someone with a fine mind and a weak will ? why did he curse that his daughter was a son ?
tell me ?
daniel upton what devilish exchange was perpetrated in the house of horror where that blasphemous monster had his trusting , child at his mercy ?
did he make it permanent as she do in the end with me ?
tell me why that thing that calls itself asenath writes differently off guard , so that you ca tell its script from then the thing happened .
derby voice was rising to a thin treble scream as he raved , when suddenly it was shut off with an almost mechanical click .
i thought of those other occasions at my home when his confidences had abruptly ceased when i had that some obscure telepathic wave of asenath mental force was intervening to keep him silent .
this , though , was something altogether different and , i felt , infinitely more horrible .
the face beside me was twisted almost unrecognizably for a moment , while through the whole body there passed a shivering motion as if all the bones , organs , muscles , nerves , and glands were adjusting themselves to a radically different posture , set of stresses , and general personality .
just where the supreme horror lay , i could not for my life tell ; yet there swept over me such a swamping wave of sickness and repulsion such a freezing , petrifying sense of utter alienage and abnormality that my grasp of the wheel grew feeble and uncertain .
the figure beside me seemed less like a lifelong friend than like some monstrous intrusion from outer space some damnable , utterly accursed focus of unknown and malign cosmic forces .
i had faltered only a moment , but before another moment was over my companion had seized the wheel and forced me to change places with him .
the dusk was now very thick , and the lights of portland far behind , so i could not see much of his face .
the blaze of his eyes , though , was phenomenal ; and i knew that he must now be in that queerly energized state so unlike his usual self which so many people had noticed .
it seemed odd and incredible that listless edward derby he who could never assert himself , and who had never learned to drive should be ordering me about and taking the wheel of my own car , yet that was precisely what had happened .
he did not speak for some time , and in my inexplicable horror i was glad he did not .
in the lights of biddeford and saco i saw his firmly set mouth , and shivered at the blaze of his eyes .
the people were right he did look damnably like his wife and like old ephraim when in these moods .
i did not wonder that the moods were disliked there was certainly something unnatural in them , and i felt the sinister element all the more because of the wild ravings i had been hearing .
this man , for all my lifelong knowledge of edward pickman derby , was a stranger an intrusion of some sort from the black abyss .
he did not speak until we were on a dark stretch of road , and when he did his voice seemed utterly unfamiliar .
it was deeper , firmer , and more decisive than i had ever known it to be ; while its accent and pronunciation were altogether changed though vaguely , remotely , and rather disturbingly recalling something i could not quite place .
there was , i thought , a trace of very profound and very genuine irony in the timbre not the flashy , meaninglessly jaunty of the callow sophisticate , which derby had habitually affected , but something grim , basic , pervasive , and potentially evil .
i marvelled at the so soon following the spell of muttering .
i hope you forget my attack back there , upton , he was saying .
you know what my nerves are , and i guess you can excuse such things .
i enormously grateful , of course , for this lift home .
and you must forget , too , any crazy things i may have been saying about my wife and about things in general .
that what comes from overstudy in a field like mine .
my philosophy is full of bizarre concepts , and when the mind gets worn out it cooks up all sorts of imaginary concrete applications .
i shall take a rest from now on you probably wo see me for some time , and you need blame asenath for it .
this trip was a bit queer , but it really very simple .
there are certain indian relics in the north wood standing stones , and all that which mean a good deal in folklore , and asenath and i are following that stuff up .
it was a hard search , so i seem to have gone off my head .
i must send somebody for the car when i get home .
a month relaxation will put me on my feet .
i do not recall just what my own part of the conversation was , for the baffling alienage of my seatmate filled all my consciousness .
with every moment my feeling of elusive cosmic horror increased , till at length i was in a virtual delirium of longing for the end of the drive .
derby did not offer to relinquish the wheel , and i was glad of the speed with which portsmouth and newburyport flashed by .
at the junction where the main highway runs inland and avoids innsmouth , i was my driver would take the bleak shore road that goes through that damnable place .
he did not , however , but darted rapidly past rowley and ipswich toward our destination .
we reached arkham before midnight , and found the lights still on at the old crowninshield house .
derby left the car with a hasty repetition of his thanks , and i drove home alone with a curious feeling of relief .
it had been a terrible drive all the more terrible because i could not quite tell why and i did not regret derby forecast of a long absence from my company .
v the next two months were full of rumours .
people spoke of seeing derby more and more in his new energized state , and asenath was scarcely ever in to her callers .
i had only one visit from edward , when he called briefly in asenath car duly reclaimed from wherever he had left it in maine to get some books he had lent me .
he was in his new state , and paused only long enough for some evasively polite remarks .
it was plain that he had nothing to discuss with me when in this condition and i noticed that he did not even trouble to give the old signal when ringing the doorbell .
as on that evening in the car , i felt a faint , infinitely deep horror which i could not explain ; so that his swift departure was a prodigious relief .
in derby was away for a week , and some of the decadent college set talked knowingly of the matter hinting at a meeting with a notorious , lately expelled from england , who had established headquarters in new york .
for my part i could not get that strange ride from maine out of my head .
the transformation i had witnessed had affected me profoundly , and i caught myself again and again trying to account for the thing and for the extreme horror it had inspired in me .
but the oddest rumours were those about the sobbing in the old crowninshield house .
the voice seemed to be a woman , and some of the younger people thought it sounded like asenath .
it was heard only at rare intervals , and would sometimes be choked off as if by force .
there was talk of an investigation , but this was dispelled one day when asenath appeared in the streets and chatted in a sprightly way with a large number of acquaintances apologizing for her recent absence and speaking incidentally about the nervous breakdown and hysteria of a guest from boston .
the guest was never seen , but asenath appearance left nothing to be said .
and then someone complicated matters by whispering that the sobs had once or twice been in a man voice .
one evening in , i heard the familiar ring at the front door .
answering it myself , i found edward on the steps , and saw in a moment that his personality was the old one which i had not encountered since the day of his ravings on that terrible ride from chesuncook .
his face was twitching with a mixture of odd emotions in which fear and triumph seemed to share dominion , and he looked furtively over his shoulder as i closed the door behind him .
following me clumsily to the study , he asked for some whiskey to steady his nerves .
i forbore to question him , but waited till he felt like beginning whatever he wanted to say .
at length he ventured some information in a choking voice .
asenath has gone , dan .
we had a long talk last night while the servants were out , and i made her promise to stop preying on me .
of course i had certain certain occult defences i never told you about .
she had to give in , but got frightfully angry .
just packed up and started for new york walked right out to catch the in to boston .
i suppose people will talk , but i ca help that .
you need mention that there was any trouble just say she gone on a long research trip .
she probably going to stay with one of her horrible groups of devotees .
i hope she go west and get a divorce anyhow , i made her promise to keep away and let me alone .
it was horrible , dan she was stealing my body crowding me out making a prisoner of me .
i lay low and pretended to let her do it , but i had to be on the watch .
i could plan if i was careful , for she ca read my mind literally , or in detail .
all she could read of my planning was a sort of general mood of rebellion and she always thought i was helpless .
never thought i could get the best of her but i had a spell or two that worked .
derby looked over his shoulder and took some more whiskey .
i paid off those damned servants this morning when they got back .
they were ugly about it , and asked questions , but they went .
they her kin innsmouth people and were hand and glove with her .
i hope they let me alone i did like the way they laughed when they walked away .
i must get as many of dad old servants again as i can .
i move back home now .
i suppose you think i crazy , dan but arkham history ought to hint at things that back up what i told you and what i going to tell you .
you seen one of the changes , too in your car after i told you about asenath that day coming home from maine .
that was when she got me drove me out of my body .
the last thing i remember was when i was all worked up trying to tell you what that is .
then she got me , and in a flash i was back at the house in the library where those damned servants had me locked up and in that cursed fiend body that is even human you know it was she you must have ridden home with that preying wolf in my body you ought to have known the difference !
i shuddered as derby paused .
surely , i had known the difference yet could i accept an explanation as insane as this ?
but my distracted caller was growing even wilder .
i had to save myself i had to , dan !
she have got me for good at hallowmass they hold a sabbat up there beyond chesuncook , and the sacrifice would have clinched things .
she have got me for good she have been i , and i have been she forever too late my body have been hers for good she have been a man , and fully human , just as she wanted to be i suppose she have put me out of the way killed her own with me in it , damn her , just as she did before just as she did , or it did before edward face was now atrociously distorted , and he bent it uncomfortably close to mine as his voice fell to a whisper .
you must know what i hinted in the car that she is asenath at all , but really old ephraim himself .
i suspected it a year and a half ago , and i know it now .
her handwriting shows it when she goes off guard sometimes she jots down a note in writing that just like her father manuscripts , stroke for stroke and sometimes she says things that nobody but an old man like ephraim could say .
he changed forms with her when he felt death coming she was the only one he could find with the right kind of brain and a weak enough will he got her body permanently , just as she almost got mine , and then poisoned the old body he put her into .
have you seen old ephraim soul glaring out of that eyes dozens of times and out of mine when she has control of my body ?
the whisperer was panting , and paused for breath .
i said nothing ; and when he resumed his voice was nearer normal .
this , i reflected , was a case for the asylum , but i would not be the one to send him there .
perhaps time and freedom from asenath would do its work .
i could see that he would never wish to dabble in morbid occultism again .
i tell you more later i must have a long rest now .
i tell you something of the forbidden horrors she led me into something of the horrors that even now are festering in corners with a few monstrous priests to keep them alive .
some people know things about the universe that nobody ought to know , and can do things that nobody ought to be able to do .
i been in it up to my neck , but that the end .
today i burn that damned necronomicon and all the rest if i were librarian at miskatonic .
but she ca get me now .
i must get out of that accursed house as soon as i can , and settle down at home .
you help me , i know , if i need help .
those devilish servants , you know and if people should get too inquisitive about asenath .
you see , i ca give them her address then there are certain groups of searchers certain cults , you know that might misunderstand our breaking up some of them have damnably curious ideas and methods .
i know you stand by me if anything happens even if i have to tell you a lot that will shock you i had edward stay and sleep in one of the that night , and in the morning he seemed calmer .
we discussed certain possible arrangements for his moving back into the derby mansion , and i hoped he would lose no time in making the change .
he did not call the next evening , but i saw him frequently during the ensuing weeks .
we talked as little as possible about strange and unpleasant things , but discussed the renovation of the old derby house , and the travels which edward promised to take with my son and me the following summer .
of asenath we said almost nothing , for i saw that the subject was a peculiarly disturbing one .
gossip , of course , was rife ; but that was no novelty in connection with the strange menage at the old crowninshield house .
one thing i did not like was what derby banker let fall in an mood at the miskatonic club about the cheques edward was sending regularly to a moses and abigail sargent and a eunice babson in innsmouth .
that looked as if those servants were extorting some kind of tribute from him yet he had not mentioned the matter to me .
i wished that the summer and my son harvard vacation would come , so that we could get edward to europe .
he was not , i soon saw , mending as rapidly as i had hoped he would ; for there was something a bit hysterical in his occasional exhilaration , while his moods of fright and depression were altogether too frequent .
the old derby house was ready by december , yet edward constantly put off moving .
though he hated and seemed to fear the crowninshield place , he was at the same time queerly enslaved by it .
he could not seem to begin dismantling things , and invented every kind of excuse to postpone action .
when i pointed this out to him he appeared unaccountably frightened .
his father old butler who was there with other reacquired servants told me one day that edward occasional prowlings about the house , and especially down cellar , looked odd and unwholesome to him .
i wondered if asenath had been writing disturbing letters , but the butler said there was no mail which could have come from her .
it was about christmas that derby broke down one evening while calling on me .
i was steering the conversation toward next summer travels when he suddenly shrieked and leaped up from his chair with a look of shocking , uncontrollable fright a cosmic panic and loathing such as only the nether gulfs of nightmare could bring to any sane mind .
my brain !
my brain !
god , dan it tugging from beyond knocking clawing that even now ephraim kamog !
kamog ! the pit of the shoggoths ia !
!
the goat with a thousand young !
the flame the flame beyond body , beyond life in the earth oh , god !
i pulled him back to his chair and poured some wine down his throat as his frenzy sank to a dull apathy .
he did not resist , but kept his lips moving as if talking to himself .
presently i realized that he was trying to talk to me , and bent my ear to his mouth to catch the feeble words .
again , again she trying i might have known nothing can stop that force ; not distance nor magic , nor death it comes and comes , mostly in the night i ca leave it horrible oh , god , dan , if you only knew as i do just how horrible it is when he had slumped down into a stupor i propped him with pillows and let normal sleep overtake him .
i did not call a doctor , for i knew what would be said of his sanity , and wished to give nature a chance if i possibly could .
he waked at midnight , and i put him to bed upstairs , but he was gone by morning .
he had let himself quietly out of the house and his butler , when called on the wire , said he was at home pacing about the library .
edward went to pieces rapidly after that .
he did not call again , but i went daily to see him .
he would always be sitting in his library , staring at nothing and having an air of abnormal listening .
sometimes he talked rationally , but always on trivial topics .
any mention of his trouble , of future plans , or of asenath would send him into a frenzy .
his butler said he had frightful seizures at night , during which he might eventually do himself harm .
i had a long talk with his doctor , banker , and lawyer , and finally took the physician with two specialist colleagues to visit him .
the spasms that resulted from the first questions were violent and pitiable and that evening a closed car took his poor struggling body to the arkham sanitarium .
i was made his guardian and called on him twice weekly almost weeping to hear his wild shrieks , awesome whispers , and dreadful , droning repetitions of such phrases as i had to do it i had to do it it get me it get me down there down there in the dark mother !
mother !
dan !
save me save me how much hope of recovery there was , no one could say , but i tried my best to be optimistic .
edward must have a home if he emerged , so i transferred his servants to the derby mansion , which would surely be his sane choice .
what to do about the crowninshield place with its complex arrangements and collections of utterly inexplicable objects i could not decide , so left it momentarily untouched telling the derby household to go over and dust the chief rooms once a week , and ordering the furnace man to have a fire on those days .
the final nightmare came before candlemas heralded , in cruel irony , by a false gleam of hope .
one morning late in january the sanitarium telephoned to report that edward reason had suddenly come back .
his continuous memory , they said , was badly impaired ; but sanity itself was certain .
of course he must remain some time for observation , but there could be little doubt of the outcome .
all going well , he would surely be free in a week .
i hastened over in a flood of delight , but stood bewildered when a nurse took me to edward room .
the patient rose to greet me , extending his hand with a polite smile ; but i saw in an instant that he bore the strangely energized personality which had seemed so foreign to his own nature the competent personality i had found so vaguely horrible , and which edward himself had once vowed was the intruding soul of his wife .
there was the same blazing vision so like asenath and old ephraim and the same firm mouth ; and when he spoke i could sense the same grim , pervasive irony in his voice the deep irony so redolent of potential evil .
this was the person who had driven my car through the night five months before the person i had not seen since that brief call when he had forgotten the oldtime doorbell signal and stirred such nebulous fears in me and now he filled me with the same dim feeling of blasphemous alienage and ineffable cosmic hideousness .
he spoke affably of arrangements for release and there was nothing for me to do but assent , despite some remarkable gaps in his recent memories .
yet i felt that something was terribly , inexplicably wrong and abnormal .
there were horrors in this thing that i could not reach .
this was a sane person but was it indeed the edward derby i had known ?
if not , who or what was it and where was edward ?
ought it to be free or confined or ought it to be extirpated from the face of the earth ?
there was a hint of the abysmally sardonic in everything the creature said the eyes lent a special and baffling mockery to certain words about the early liberty earned by an especially close confinement !
i must have behaved very awkwardly , and was glad to beat a retreat .
all that day and the next i racked my brain over the problem .
what had happened ?
what sort of mind looked out through those alien eyes in edward face ?
i could think of nothing but this dimly terrible enigma , and gave up all efforts to perform my usual work .
the second morning the hospital called up to say that the recovered patient was unchanged , and by evening i was close to a nervous collapse a state i admit , though others will vow it coloured my subsequent vision .
i have nothing to say on this point except that no madness of mine could account for all the evidence .
it was in the night after that second evening that stark , utter horror burst over me and weighted my spirit with a black , clutching panic from which it can never shake free .
it began with a telephone call just before midnight .
i was the only one up , and sleepily took down the receiver in the library .
no one seemed to be on the wire , and i was about to hang up and go to bed when my ear caught a very faint suspicion of sound at the other end .
was someone trying under great difficulties to talk ?
as i listened i thought i heard a sort of half liquid bubbling noise glub glub glub which had an odd suggestion of inarticulate , unintelligible word and syllable divisions .
i called who is it ?
but the only answer was glub
glub .
i could only assume that the noise was mechanical ; but fancying that it might be a case of a broken instrument able to receive but not to send , i added , i ca hear you .
better hang up and try information .
immediately i heard the receiver go on the hook at the other end .
this , i say , was just about midnight .
when the call was traced afterward it was found to come from the old crowninshield house , though it was fully half a week from the housemaid day to be there .
i shall only hint what was found at that house the upheaval in a remote cellar storeroom , the tracks , the dirt , the hastily rifled wardrobe , the baffling marks on the telephone , the clumsily used stationery , and the detestable stench lingering over everything .
the police , poor fools , have their smug little theories , and are still searching for those sinister discharged servants who have dropped out of sight amidst the present furore .
they speak of a ghoulish revenge for things that were done , and say i was included because i was edward best friend and adviser .
idiots !
do they fancy those brutish clowns could have forged that handwriting ?
do they fancy they could have brought what later came ?
are they blind to the changes in that body that was edward ?
as for me , i now believe all that edward derby ever told me .
there are horrors beyond life edge that we do not suspect , and once in a while man evil prying calls them just within our range .
ephraim asenath that devil called them in , and they engulfed edward as they are engulfing me .
can i be sure that i am safe ?
those powers survive the life of the physical form .
the next day in the afternoon , when i pulled out of my prostration and was able to walk and talk coherently i went to the madhouse and shot him dead for edward and the world sake , but can i be sure till he is cremated ?
they are keeping the body for some silly autopsies by different doctors but i say he must be cremated .
he must be cremated he who was not edward derby when i shot him .
i shall go mad if he is not , for i may be the next .
but my will is not weak and i shall not let it be undermined by the terrors i know are seething around it .
one life ephraim , asenath , and edward who now ?
i will not be driven out of my body i will not change souls with that lich in the madhouse !
but let me try to tell coherently of that final horror .
i will not speak of what the police persistently ignored the tales of that dwarfed , grotesque , malodorous thing met by at least three wayfarers in high street just before two , and the nature of the single footprints in certain places .
i will say only that just about two the doorbell and knocker waked me doorbell and knocker both , applied alternately and uncertainly in a kind of weak desperation , and each trying to keep edward old signal of strokes .
roused from sound sleep , my mind leaped into a turmoil .
derby at the door and remembering the old code !
that new personality had not remembered it was edward suddenly back in his rightful state ?
why was he here in such evident stress and haste ?
had he been released ahead of time , or had he escaped ?
perhaps , i thought as i flung on a robe and bounded downstairs , his return to his own self had brought raving and violence , revoking his discharge and driving him to a desperate dash for freedom .
whatever had happened , he was good old edward again , and i would help him !
when i opened the door into the blackness a gust of insufferably foetid wind almost flung me prostrate .
i choked in nausea , and for a second scarcely saw the dwarfed , humped figure on the steps .
the summons had been edward , but who was this foul , stunted parody ?
where had edward had time to go ?
his ring had sounded only a second before the door opened .
the caller had on one of edward overcoats its bottom almost touching the ground , and its sleeves rolled back yet still covering the hands .
on the head was a slouch hat pulled low , while a black silk muffler concealed the face .
as i stepped unsteadily forward , the figure made a sound like that i had heard over the telephone glub glub and thrust at me a large , closely written paper impaled on the end of a long pencil .
still reeling from the morbid and unaccountable foetor , i seized the paper and tried to read it in the light from the doorway .
beyond question , it was in edward script .
but why had he written when he was close enough to ring and why was the script so awkward , coarse and shaky ?
i could make out nothing in the dim half light , so edged back into the hall , the dwarf figure clumping mechanically after but pausing on the inner door threshold .
the odour of this singular messenger was really appalling , and i hoped ( not in vain , thank god ! )
that my wife would not wake and confront it .
then , as i read the paper , i felt my knees give under me and my vision go black .
i was lying on the floor when i came to , that accursed sheet still clutched in my hand .
this is what it said .
dan go to the sanitarium and kill it .
exterminate it .
it is edward derby any more .
she got me it asenath and she has been dead three months and a half .
i lied when i said she had gone away .
i killed her .
i had to .
it was sudden , but we were alone and i was in my right body .
i saw a candlestick and smashed her head in .
she would have got me for good at hallowmass .
i buried her in the farther cellar storeroom under some old boxes and cleaned up all the traces .
the servants suspected next morning , but they have such secrets that they dare not tell the police .
i sent them off , but god knows what they and others of the cult will do .
i thought for a while i was all right , and then i felt the tugging at my brain .
i knew what it was i ought to have remembered .
a soul like hers or ephraim is half detached , and keeps right on after death as long as the body lasts .
she was getting me making me change bodies with her seizing my body and putting me in that corpse of hers buried in the cellar .
i knew what was coming that why i snapped and had to go to the asylum .
then it came i found myself choked in the dark in asenath rotting carcass down there in the cellar under the boxes where i put it .
and i knew she must be in my body at the sanitarium permanently , for it was after hallowmass , and the sacrifice would work even without her being there sane , and ready for release as a menace to the world .
i was desperate , and in spite of everything i clawed my way out .
i too far gone to talk i could manage to telephone but i can still write .
i get fixed up somehow and bring this last word and warning .
kill that fiend if you value the peace and comfort of the world .
see that it is cremated .
if you do , it will live on and on , body to body forever , and i ca tell you what it will do .
keep clear of black magic , dan , it the devil business .
goodbye you been a great friend .
tell the police whatever they believe and i damnably sorry to drag all this on you .
i be at peace before long this thing wo hold together much more .
hope you can read this .
and kill that thing kill it .
yours ed .
it was only afterward that i read the last half of this paper , for i had fainted at the end of the third paragraph .
i fainted again when i saw and smelled what cluttered up the threshold where the warm air had struck it .
the messenger would not move or have consciousness any more .
the butler , than i , did not faint at what met him in the hall in the morning .
instead , he telephoned the police .
when they came i had been taken upstairs to bed , but the other mass lay where it had collapsed in the night .
the men put handkerchiefs to their noses .
what they finally found inside edward clothes was mostly liquescent horror .
there were bones , too and a skull .
some dental work positively identified the skull as asenath .
in relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented , i am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative .
it is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena , seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few , which lie outside its common experience .
men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal ; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them ; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricism .
my name is jervas dudley , and from earliest childhood i have been a dreamer and a visionary .
wealthy beyond the necessity of a commercial life , and temperamentally unfitted for the formal studies and social recreations of my acquaintances , i have dwelt ever in realms apart from the visible world ; spending my youth and adolescence in ancient and books , and in roaming the fields and groves of the region near my ancestral home .
i do not think that what i read in these books or saw in these fields and groves was exactly what other boys read and saw there ; but of this i must say little , since detailed speech would but confirm those cruel slanders upon my intellect which i sometimes overhear from the whispers of the stealthy attendants around me .
it is sufficient for me to relate events without analysing causes .
i have said that i dwelt apart from the visible world , but i have not said that i dwelt alone .
this no human creature may do ; for lacking the fellowship of the living , he inevitably draws upon the companionship of things that are not , or are no longer , living .
close by my home there lies a singular wooded hollow , in whose twilight deeps i spent most of my time ; reading , thinking and dreaming .
down its slopes my first steps of infancy were taken , and around its grotesquely gnarled oak trees my first fancies of boyhood were woven .
well did i come to know the presiding dryads of those trees , and often have i watched their wild dances in the struggling beams of waning moon but of these things i must not now speak .
i will tell only of the lone tomb in the darkest of the hillside thickets ; the deserted tomb of the hydes , an old and exalted family whose last direct descendant had been laid within its black recesses many decades before my birth .
the vault to which i refer is an ancient granite , weathered and discoloured by the mists and dampness of generations .
excavated back into the hillside , the structure is visible only at the entrance .
the door , a ponderous and forbidding slab of stone , hangs upon rusted iron hinges , and is fastened ajar in a queerly sinister way by means of heavy iron chains and padlocks , according to a gruesome fashion of half a century ago .
the abode of the race whose scions are inurned had once crowned the declivity which holds the tomb , but had long since fallen victim to the flames which sprang up from a disastrous stroke of lighting .
of the midnight storm which destroyed this gloomy mansion , the older inhabitants of the region sometimes speak in hushed and uneasy voices ; alluding to what they call divine wrath in a manner that in later years vaguely increased the always strong fascination which i felt for the sepulchre .
one man only had perished in the fire .
when the last of the hydes was buried in this place of shade and stillness , the sad urnful of ashes had come from a distant land ; to which the family had repaired when the mansion burned down .
no one remains to lay flowers before the granite portal , and few care to brave the depressing shadows which seem to linger strangely about the stones .
i shall never forget the afternoon when first i stumbled upon the house of the dead .
it was in , when the alchemy of nature transmutes the sylvan landscape to one vivid and almost homogeneous mass of green ; when the senses are intoxicated with the surging seas of moist verdure and the subtly indefinable odours of the soil and the vegetation .
in such surroundings the mind loses its perspective ; time and space become trivial and unreal , and echoes of a forgotten prehistoric past beat insistently upon the enthralled consciousness .
all day i had been wandering through the mystic groves of the hollow ; thinking thoughts i need not discuss , and conversing with things i need not name .
in years a child of ten , i had seen and heard many wonders unknown to the throng ; and was oddly aged in certain respects .
when , upon forcing my way between two savage clumps of briers , i suddenly encountered the entrance of the vault , i had no knowledge of what i had discovered .
the dark blocks of granite , the door so curiously ajar , and the funereal carvings above the arch , aroused in me no associations of mournful or terrible character .
of graves and tombs i knew and imagined much , but had on account of my peculiar temperament been kept from all personal contact with churchyards and cemeteries .
the strange stone house on the woodland slope was to me only a source of interest and speculation ; and its cold , damp interior , into which i vainly peered through the aperture so tantalisingly left , contained for me no hint of death or decay .
but in that instant of curiosity was born the madly unreasoning desire which has brought me to this hell of confinement .
spurred on by a voice which must have come from the hideous soul of the forest , i resolved to enter the beckoning gloom in spite of the ponderous chains which barred my passage .
in the waning light of day i alternately rattled the rusty impediments with a view to throwing wide the stone door , and essayed to squeeze my slight form through the space already provided ; but neither plan met with success .
at first curious , i was not frantic ; and when in the thickening twilight i returned to my home , i had sworn to the hundred gods of the grove that at any cost i would some day force an entrance to the black chilly depths that seemed calling out to me .
the physician with the beard who comes each day to my room once told a visitor that this decision marked the beginnings of a pitiful monomania ; but i will leave final judgement to my readers when they shall have learnt all .
the months following my discovery were spent in futile attempts to force the complicated padlock of the slightly open vault , and in carefully guarded inquiries regarding the nature and history of the structure .
with the traditionally receptive ears of the small boy , i learned much ; though an habitual secretiveness caused me to tell no one of my information or my resolve .
it is perhaps worth mentioning that i was not at all surprised or terrified on learning of the nature of the vault .
my rather original ideas regarding life and death had caused me to associate the cold clay with the breathing body in a vague fashion ; and i felt that the great sinister family of the mansion was in some way represented within the stone space i sought to explore .
mumbled tales of the weird rites and godless revels of bygone years in the ancient hall gave to me a new and potent interest in the tomb , before whose door i would sit for hours at a time each day .
once i thrust a candle within the nearly closed entrance , but could see nothing save a flight of damp stone steps leading downward .
the odour of the place repelled yet bewitched me .
i felt i had known it before , in a past remote beyond all recollection ; beyond even my tenancy of the body i now possess .
the year after i first beheld the tomb , i stumbled upon a translation of plutarch lives in the attic of my home .
reading the life of theseus , i was much impressed by that passage telling of the great stone beneath which the boyish hero was to find his tokens of destiny whenever he should become old enough to lift its enormous weight .
this legend had the effect of dispelling my keenest impatience to enter the vault , for it made me feel that the time was not yet ripe .
later , i told myself , i should grow to a strength and ingenuity which might enable me to unfasten the heavily chained door with ease ; but until then i would do better by conforming to what seemed the will of fate .
accordingly my watches by the dank portal became less persistent , and much of my time was spent in other though equally strange pursuits .
i would sometimes rise very quietly in the night , stealing out to walk in those churchyards and places of burial from which i had been kept by my parents .
what i did there i may not say , for i am not now sure of the reality of certain things ; but i know that on the day after such a nocturnal ramble i would often astonish those about me with my knowledge of topics almost forgotten for many generations .
it was after a night like this that i shocked the community with a queer conceit about the burial of the rich and celebrated squire brewster , a maker of local history who was interred in , and whose slate headstone , bearing a graven skull and crossbones , was slowly crumbling to power .
in a moment of childish imagination i vowed not only that the undertaker , goodman simpson , had stolen the shoes , silken hose , and satin of the deceased before burial ; but that the squire himself , not fully inanimate , had turned twice in his coffin on the day of interment .
but the idea of entering the tomb never left my thoughts ; being indeed stimulated by the unexpected genealogical discover that my own maternal ancestry possessed at least a slight link with the supposedly extinct family of the hydes .
last of my paternal race , i was likewise the last of this older and more mysterious line .
i began to feel that the tomb was mine , and to look forward with hot eagerness to the time when i might pass within that stone door and down those slimy stone steps in the dark .
i now formed the habit of listening very intently at the slightly open portal , choosing my favourite hours of midnight stillness for the odd vigil .
by the time i came of age , i had made a small clearing in the thicket before the facade of the hillside , allowing the surrounding vegetation to encircle and overhang the space like the walls and roof of sylvan bower .
this bower was my temple , the fastened door my shrine , and here i would like outstretched on the mossy ground , thinking strange thoughts and dreaming of strange dreams .
the night of the first revelation was a sultry one .
i must have fallen asleep from fatigue , for it was with a distinct sense of awakening that i heard the voices .
of those tones and accents i hesitate to speak ; of their quality i will not speak ; but i may say that they presented certain uncanny differences in vocabulary , pronunciation , and mode of utterance .
every shade of new england dialect , from the uncouth syllables of the puritan colonists to the precise rhetoric of fifty years ago , seemed represented in that shadowy colloquy , though it was only later that i noticed the fact .
at the time , indeed , my attention was distracted from this matter by another phenomenon ; a phenomenon so fleeting that i could not take oath upon its reality .
i barely fancied that as i awoke , a light had been hurriedly extinguished within the sunken sepulchre .
i do not think i was either astounded or , but i know that i was greatly and permanently changed that night .
upon returning home i went with much directness to a rotting chest in the attic , wherein i found the key which next day unlocked with ease the barrier i had so long stormed in vain .
it was in the soft glow of late afternoon that i first entered the vault on the abandoned slope .
a spell was upon me , and my heart leaped with an exultation i can but ill describe .
as i closed the door behind me and descended the dripping steps by the light of my lone candle , i seemed to know the way ; and though the candle sputtered with the stifling reek of the place , i felt singularly at home in the musty , air .
looking about me , i beheld many marble slabs bearing coffins , or the remains of coffins .
some of these were sealed and intact , but others had nearly vanished , leaving the silver handles and plates isolated amidst certain curious heaps of whitish dust .
upon one plate i read the name of sir geoffrey hyde , who had come from sussex in and died here a few years later .
in a conspicuous alcove was one fairly and untenanted casket , adorned with a single name which brought to me both a smile and a shudder .
an odd impulse caused me to climb upon the broad slab , extinguish my candle , and lie down within the vacant box .
in the grey light of dawn i staggered from the vault and locked the chain of the door behind me .
i was no longer a young man , though but winters had chilled my bodily frame .
villagers who observed my homeward progress looked at me strangely , and marvelled at the signs of ribald revelry which they saw in one whose life was known to be sober and solitary .
i did not appear before my parents till after a long and refreshing sleep .
henceforward i haunted the tomb each night ; seeing , hearing , and doing things i must never reveal .
my speech , always susceptible to environmental influences , was the first thing to succumb to the change ; and my suddenly acquired archaism of diction was soon remarked upon .
later a queer boldness and recklessness came into my demeanour , till i unconsciously grew to possess the bearing of a man of the world despite my lifelong seclusion .
my formerly silent tongue waxed voluble with the easy grace of a chesterfield or the godless cynicism of a rochester .
i displayed a peculiar erudition utterly unlike the fantastic , monkish lore over which i had pored in youth ; and covered the flyleaves of my books with facile impromptu epigrams which brought up suggestions of gay , prior , and the sprightliest of augustan wits and rimesters .
one morning at breakfast i came close to disaster by declaiming in palpably liquourish accents an effusion of eighteenth century bacchanalian mirth ; a bit of georgian playfulness never recorded in a book , which ran something like this come hither , my lads , with your tankards of ale , and drink to the present before it shall fail ; pile each on your platter a mountain of beef , for is eating and drinking that bring us relief so fill up your glass , so life will soon pass ; when you dead ye drink to your king or your lass !
anacreon had a red nose , so they say ; but what a red nose if ye happy and gay ?
gad split me !
i rather be red whilst i here , than white as a lily and dead half a year !
so betty , my miss , come give me kiss ; in hell there no innkeeper daughter like this !
young harry , propp up just as straight as he able , will soon lose his wig and slip under the table ; but fill up your goblets and pass around better under the table than under the ground !
so revel and chaff as ye thirstily quaff under six feet of dirt is less easy to laugh !
the fiend strike me blue !
i scarce able to walk , and damn me if i can stand upright or talk !
here , landlord , bid betty to summon a chair ; i try home for a while , for my wife is not there !
so lend me a hand ; i not able to stand , but i gay whilst i linger on top of the land !
about this time i conceived my present fear of fire and thunderstorms .
previously indifferent to such things , i had now an unspeakable horror of them ; and would retire to the innermost recesses of the house whenever the heavens threatened an electrical display .
a favourite haunt of mine during the day was the ruined cellar of the mansion that had burned down , and in fancy i would picture the structure as it had been in its prime .
on one occasion i startled a villager by leading him confidently to a shallow , of whose existence i seemed to know in spite of the fact that it had been unseen and forgotten for many generations .
at last came that which i had long feared .
my parents , alarmed at the altered manner and appearance of their only son , commenced to exert over my movements a kindly espionage which threatened to result in disaster .
i had told no one of my visits to the tomb , having guarded my secret purpose with religious zeal since childhood ; but now i was forced to exercise care in threading the mazes of the wooded hollow , that i might throw off a possible pursuer .
my key to the vault i kept suspended from a cord about my neck , its presence known only to me .
i never carried out of the sepulchre any of the things i came upon whilst within its walls .
one morning as i emerged from the damp tomb and fastened the chain of the portal with none too steady hand , i beheld in an adjacent thicket the dreaded face of a watcher .
surely the end was near ; for my bower was discovered , and the objective of my nocturnal journeys revealed .
the man did not accost me , so i hastened home in an effort to overhear what he might report to my careworn father .
were my sojourns beyond the chained door about to be proclaimed to the world ?
imagine my delighted astonishment on hearing the spy inform my parent in cautious whisper that i had spent the night in the bower outside the tomb ; my eyes fixed upon the crevice where the padlocked portal stood ajar !
by what miracle had the watcher been thus deluded ?
i was now convinced that a supernatural agency protected me .
made bold by this circumstance , i began to resume perfect openness in going to the vault ; confident that no one could witness my entrance .
for a week i tasted to the full the joys of that charnel conviviality which i must not describe , when the thing happened , and i was borne away to this accursed abode of sorrow and monotony .
i should not have ventured out that night ; for the taint of thunder was in the clouds , and hellish phosphorescence rose from the rank swamp at the bottom of the hollow .
the call of the dead , too , was different .
instead of the hillside tomb , it was the charred cellar on the crest of the slope whose presiding daemon beckoned to me with unseen fingers .
as i emerged from an intervening grove upon the plain before the ruin , i beheld in the misty moonlight a thing i had always vaguely expected .
the mansion , gone for a century , once more reared its stately height to the raptured vision ; every window ablaze with the splendour of many candles .
up the long drive rolled the coaches of the boston gentry , whilst on foot came a numerous assemblage of powdered exquisites from the neighbouring mansions .
with this throng i mingled , though i knew i belonged with the hosts rather than the guests .
inside the hall were music , laughter , and wine on every hand .
several faces i recognised ; though i should have known them better had they been shrivelled or eaten away by death and decomposition .
amidst a wild and reckless throng i was the wildest and most abandoned .
gay blasphemy poured in torrents from my lips , and in my shocking sallies i heeded no law of god , man , or nature .
suddenly a peal of thunder , resonant even above the din of the swinish revelry , clave the very roof and laid a hush of fear upon the boisterous company .
red tongues of flame and searing gusts of heat engulfed the house ; and the roysterers , struck with terror at the descent of a calamity which seemed to transcend the bounds of unguided nature , fled shrieking into the night .
i alone remained , riveted to my seat by a grovelling fear which i had never felt before .
and then a second horror took possession of my soul .
burnt alive to ashes , my body dispersed by the four winds , i might never lie in the tomb of hydes !
was not my coffin prepared for me ?
had i not a right to rest till eternity amongst the descendants of sir geoffrey hyde ?
aye !
i would claim my heritage of death , even though my soul go seeking through the ages for another corporeal tenement to represent it on that vacant slab in the alcove of the vault .
jervas hyde should never share the sad fate of palinurus !
as the phantom of the burning house faded , i found myself screaming and struggling madly in the arms of two men , one of whom was the spy who had followed me to the tomb .
rain was pouring down in torrents , and upon the southern horizon were flashes of the lightning that had so lately passed over our heads .
my father , his face lined with sorrow , stood by as i shouted my demands to be laid within the tomb ; frequently admonishing my captors to treat me as gently as they could .
a blackened circle on the floor of the ruined cellar told of a violent stroke from the heavens ; and from this spot a group of curious villagers with lanterns were prying a small box of antique workmanship which the thunderbolt had brought to light .
ceasing my futile and now objectless writhing , i watched the spectators as they viewed the , and was permitted to share in their discoveries .
the box , whose fastenings were broken by the stroke which had unearthed it , contained many papers and objects of value ; but i had eyes for one thing alone .
it was the porcelain miniature of a young man in a smartly curled , and bore the initials .
the face was such that as i gazed , i might well have been studying my mirror .
on the following day i was brought to this room with the barred windows , but i have been kept informed of certain things through an aged and servitor , for whom i bore a fondness in infancy , and who like me loves the churchyard .
what i have dared relate of my experiences within the vault has brought me only pitying smiles .
my father , who visits me frequently , declares that at no time did i pass the chained portal , and swears that the rusted padlock had not been touched for fifty years when he examined it .
he even says that all the village knew of my journeys to the tomb , and that i was often watched as i slept in the bower outside the grim facade , my eyes fixed on the crevice that leads to the interior .
against these assertions i have no tangible proof to offer , since my key to the padlock was lost in the struggle on that night of horrors .
the strange things of the past which i learnt during those nocturnal meetings with the dead he dismisses as the fruits of my lifelong and omnivorous browsing amongst the ancient volumes of the family library .
had it not been for my old servant hiram , i should have by this time become quite convinced of my madness .
but hiram , loyal to the last , has held faith in me , and has done that which impels me to make public at least a part of my story .
a week ago he burst open the lock which chains the door of the tomb perpetually ajar , and descended with a lantern into the murky depths .
on a slab in an alcove he found an old but empty coffin whose tarnished plate bears the single word jervas .
in that coffin and in that vault they have promised me i shall be buried .
of the events which took place at the norton mine on october eighteenth and nineteenth , , i have no desire to speak .
a sense of duty to science is all that impels me to recall , in the last years of my life , scenes and happenings fraught with a terror doubly acute because i can not wholly define it .
but i believe that before i die i should tell what i know of the shall i say transition of juan romero .
my name and origin need not be related to posterity ; in fact , i fancy it is better that they should not be , for when a man suddenly migrates to the states or the colonies , he leaves his past behind him .
besides , what i once was is not in the least relevant to my narrative ; save perhaps the fact that during my service in india i was more at home amongst native teachers than amongst my brother officers .
i had delved not a little into odd eastern lore when overtaken by the calamities which brought about my new life in america vast west a life wherein i found it well to accept a name my present one which is very common and carries no meaning .
in the summer and autumn of i dwelt in the drear expanses of the cactus mountains , employed as a common labourer at the celebrated norton mine , whose discovery by an aged prospector some years before had turned the surrounding region from a nearly unpeopled waste to a seething cauldron of sordid life .
a cavern of gold , lying deep beneath a mountain lake , had enriched its venerable finder beyond his wildest dreams , and now formed the seat of extensive tunneling operations on the part of the corporation to which it had finally been sold .
additional grottoes had been found , and the yield of yellow metal was exceedingly great ; so that a mighty and heterogeneous army of miners toiled day and night in the numerous passages and rock hollows .
the superintendent , a arthur , often discussed the singularity of the local geological formations ; speculating on the probable extent of the chain of caves , and estimating the future of the titanic mining enterprises .
he considered the auriferous cavities the result of the action of water , and believed the last of them would soon be opened .
it was not long after my arrival and employment that juan romero came to the norton mine .
one of the large herd of unkempt mexicans attracted thither from the neighbouring country , he at first attracted attention only because of his features ; which though plainly of the red indian type , were yet remarkable for their light colour and refined conformation , being vastly unlike those of the average greaser or piute of the locality .
it is curious that although he differed so widely from the mass of hispanicised and tribal indians , romero gave not the least impression of caucasian blood .
it was not the castilian conquistador or the american pioneer , but the ancient and noble aztec , whom imagination called to view when the silent peon would rise in the early morning and gaze in fascination at the sun as it crept above the eastern hills , meanwhile stretching out his arms to the orb as if in the performance of some rite whose nature he did not himself comprehend .
but save for his face , romero was not in any way suggestive of nobility .
ignorant and dirty , he was at home amongst the other mexicans ; having come ( so i was afterward told ) from the very lowest sort of surroundings .
he had been found as a child in a crude mountain hut , the only survivor of an epidemic which had stalked lethally by .
near the hut , close to a rather unusual rock fissure , had lain two skeletons , newly picked by vultures , and presumably forming the sole remains of his parents .
no one recalled their identity , and they were soon forgotten by the many .
indeed , the crumbling of the adobe hut and the closing of the by a subsequent avalanche had helped to efface even the scene from recollection .
reared by a mexican who had given him his name , juan differed little from his fellows .
the attachment which romero manifested toward me was undoubtedly commenced through the quaint and ancient hindoo ring which i wore when not engaged in active labour .
of its nature , and manner of coming into my possession , i can not speak .
it was my last link with a chapter of my life forever closed , and i valued it highly .
soon i observed that the mexican was likewise interested ; eyeing it with an expression that banished all suspicion of mere covetousness .
its hoary hieroglyphs seemed to stir some faint recollection in his untutored but active mind , though he could not possibly have beheld their like before .
within a few weeks after his advent , romero was like a faithful servant to me ; this notwithstanding the fact that i was myself but an ordinary miner .
our conversation was necessarily limited .
he knew but a few words of english , while i found my oxonian spanish was something quite different from the patois of the peon of new spain .
the event which i am about to relate was unheralded by long premonitions .
though the man romero had interested me , and though my ring had affected him peculiarly , i think that neither of us had any expectation of what was to follow when the great blast was set off .
geological considerations had dictated an extension of the mine directly downward from the deepest part of the subterranean area ; and the belief of the superintendent that only solid rock would be encountered , had led to the placing of a prodigious charge of dynamite .
with this work romero and i were not connected , wherefore our first knowledge of extraordinary conditions came from others .
the charge , heavier perhaps than had been estimated , had seemed to shake the entire mountain .
windows in shanties on the slope outside were shattered by the shock , whilst miners throughout the nearer passages were knocked from their feet .
jewel lake , which lay above the scene of action , heaved as in a tempest .
upon investigation it was seen that a new abyss yawned indefinitely below the seat of the blast ; an abyss so monstrous that no handy line might fathom it , nor any lamp illuminate it .
baffled , the excavators sought a conference with the superintendent , who ordered great lengths of rope to be taken to the pit , and spliced and lowered without cessation till a bottom might be discovered .
shortly afterward the workmen apprised the superintendent of their failure .
firmly though respectfully , they signified their refusal to revisit the chasm or indeed to work further in the mine until it might be sealed .
something beyond their experience was evidently confronting them , for so far as they could ascertain , the void below was infinite .
the superintendent did not reproach them .
instead , he pondered deeply , and made plans for the following day .
the night shift did not go on that evening .
at two in the morning a lone coyote on the mountain began to howl dismally .
from somewhere within the works a dog barked an answer ; either to the coyote or to something else .
a storm was gathering around the peaks of the range , and weirdly shaped clouds scudded horribly across the blurred patch of celestial light which marked a gibbous moon attempts to shine through many layers of vapours .
it was romero voice , coming from the bunk above , that awakened me , a voice excited and tense with some vague expectation i could not understand madre de dios ! el sonido ese sonido oiga vd ! lo oye vd ? señor , !
i listened , wondering what sound he meant .
the coyote , the dog , the storm , all were audible ; the last named now gaining ascendancy as the wind shrieked more and more frantically .
flashes of lightning were visible through the window .
i questioned the nervous mexican , repeating the sounds i had heard el coyote el perro el viento ?
but romero did not reply .
then he commenced whispering as in awe el ritmo , señor el ritmo de la tierra !
and now i also heard ; heard and shivered and without knowing why .
deep , deep , below me was a sound a rhythm , just as the peon had said which , though exceedingly faint , yet dominated even the dog , the coyote , and the increasing tempest .
to seek to describe it was useless for it was such that no description is possible .
perhaps it was like the pulsing of the engines far down in a great liner , as sensed from the deck , yet it was not so mechanical ; not so devoid of the element of the life and consciousness .
of all its qualities , remoteness in the earth most impressed me .
to my mind rushed fragments of a passage in joseph glanvil which poe has quoted with tremendous effect the vastness , profundity , and unsearchableness of his works , which have a depth in them greater than the well of democritus .
suddenly romero leaped from his bunk , pausing before me to gaze at the strange ring on my hand , which glistened queerly in every flash of lightning , and then staring intently in the direction of the mine shaft .
i also rose , and both of us stood motionless for a time , straining our ears as the uncanny rhythm seemed more and more to take on a vital quality .
then without apparent volition we began to move toward the door , whose rattling in the gale held a comforting suggestion of earthly reality .
the chanting in the depths for such the sound now seemed to be grew in volume and distinctness ; and we felt irresistibly urged out into the storm and thence to the gaping blackness of the shaft .
we encountered no living creature , for the men of the night shift had been released from duty , and were doubtless at the dry gulch settlement pouring sinister rumours into the ear of some drowsy bartender .
from the watchman cabin , however , gleamed a small square of yellow light like a guardian eye .
i dimly wondered how the rhythmic sound had affected the watchman ; but romero was moving more swiftly now , and i followed without pausing .
as we descended the shaft , the sound beneath grew definitely composite .
it struck me as horribly like a sort of oriental ceremony , with beating of drums and chanting of many voices .
i have , as you are aware , been much in india .
romero and i moved without material hesitancy through drifts and down ladders ; ever toward the thing that allured us , yet ever with a pitifully helpless fear and reluctance .
at one time i fancied i had gone mad this was when , on wondering how our way was lighted in the absence of lamp or candle , i realized that the ancient ring on my finger was glowing with eerie radiance , diffusing a pallid lustre through the damp , heavy air around .
it was without warning that romero , after clambering down one of the many wide ladders , broke into a run and left me alone .
some new and wild note in the drumming and chanting , perceptible but slightly to me , had acted on him in a startling fashion ; and with a wild outcry he forged ahead unguided in the cavern gloom .
i heard his repeated shrieks before me , as he stumbled awkwardly along the level places and scrambled madly down the rickety ladders .
and frightened as i was , i yet retained enough of my perception to note that his speech , when articulate , was not of any sort known to me .
harsh but impressive polysyllables had replaced the customary mixture of bad spanish and worse english , and of these , only the oft repeated cry huitzilopotchli seemed in the least familiar .
later i definitely placed that word in the works of a great historian and shuddered when the association came to me .
the climax of that awful night was composite but fairly brief , beginning just as i reached the final cavern of the journey .
out of the darkness immediately ahead burst a final shriek from the mexican , which was joined by such a chorus of uncouth sound as i could never hear again and survive .
in that moment it seemed as if all the hidden terrors and monstrosities of earth had become articulate in an effort to overwhelm the human race .
simultaneously the light from my ring was extinguished , and i saw a new light glimmering from lower space but a few yards ahead of me .
i had arrived at the abyss , which was now redly aglow , and which had evidently swallowed up the unfortunate romero .
advancing , i peered over the edge of that chasm which no line could fathom , and which was now a pandemonium of flickering flame and hideous uproar .
at first i beheld nothing but a seething blur of luminosity ; but then shapes , all infinitely distant , began to detach themselves from the confusion , and i saw was it juan romero ? but god !
i dare not tell you what i saw ! some power from heaven , coming to my aid , obliterated both sights and sounds in such a crash as may be heard when two universes collide in space .
chaos supervened , and i knew the peace of oblivion .
i hardly know how to continue , since conditions so singular are involved ; but i will do my best , not even trying to differentiate betwixt the real and the apparent .
when i awakened , i was safe in my bunk and the red glow of dawn was visible at the window .
some distance away the lifeless body of juan romero lay upon a table , surrounded by a group of men , including the camp doctor .
the men were discussing the strange death of the mexican as he lay asleep ; a death seemingly connected in some way with the terrible bolt of lightning which had struck and shaken the mountain .
no direct cause was evident , and an autopsy failed to show any reason why romero should not be living .
snatches of conversation indicated beyond a doubt that neither romero nor i had left the during the night ; that neither of us had been awake during the frightful storm which had passed over the cactus range .
that storm , said men who had ventured down the mine shaft , had caused extensive , and had completely closed the deep abyss which had created so much apprehension the day before .
when i asked the watchman what sounds he had heard prior to the mighty thunderbolt ; he mentioned a coyote , a dog , and the snarling mountain wind nothing more .
nor do i doubt his word .
upon the resumption of work , superintendent arthur called upon some especially dependable men to make a few investigations around the spot where the gulf had appeared .
though hardly eager , they obeyed , and a deep boring was made .
results were very curious .
the roof of the void , as seen when it was open , was not by any means thick ; yet now the drills of the investigators met what appeared to be a limitless extent of solid rock .
finding nothing else , not even gold , the superintendent abandoned his attempts ; but a perplexed look occasionally steals over his countenance as he sits thinking at his desk .
one other thing is curious .
shortly after waking on that morning after the storm , i noticed the unaccountable absence of my hindoo ring from my finger .
i had prized it greatly , yet nevertheless felt a sensation of relief at its disappearance .
if one of my appropriated it , he must have been quite clever in disposing of his booty , for despite advertisements and a police search , the ring was never seen again .
somehow i doubt if it was stolen by mortal hands , for many strange things were taught me in india .
my opinion of my whole experience varies from time to time .
in broad daylight , and at most seasons i am apt to think the greater part of it a mere dream ; but sometimes in the autumn , about two in the morning when the winds and animals howl dismally , there comes from inconceivable depths below a damnable suggestion of rhythmical throbbing and i feel that the transition of juan romero was a terrible one indeed .
many years ago , when the hillside villa was new and resplendent , there dwelt within it the two sculptors kalos and musides .
from lydia to neapolis the beauty of their work was praised , and none dared say that the one excelled the other in skill .
the hermes of kalos stood in a marble shrine in corinth , and the pallas of musides surmounted a pillar in athens near the parthenon .
all men paid homage to kalos and musides , and marvelled that no shadow of artistic jealousy cooled the warmth of their brotherly friendship .
but though kalos and musides dwelt in unbroken harmony , their natures were not alike .
whilst musides revelled by night amidst the urban gaieties of tegea , kalos would remain at home ; stealing away from the sight of his slaves into the cool recesses of the olive grove .
there he would meditate upon the visions that filled his mind , and there devise the forms of beauty which later became immortal in breathing marble .
idle folk , indeed , said that kalos conversed with the spirits of the grove , and that his statues were but images of the fauns and dryads he met there for he patterned his work after no living model .
so famous were kalos and musides , that none wondered when the tyrant of syracuse sent to them deputies to speak of the costly statue of tyche which he had planned for his city .
of great size and cunning workmanship must the statue be , for it was to form a wonder of nations and a goal of travellers .
exalted beyond thought would be he whose work should gain acceptance , and for this honor kalos and musides were invited to compete .
their brotherly love was well known , and the crafty tyrant surmised that each , instead of concealing his work from the other , would offer aid and advice ; this charity producing two images of unheard of beauty , the lovelier of which would eclipse even the dreams of poets .
with joy the sculptors hailed the tyrant offer , so that in the days that followed their slaves heard the ceaseless blows of chisels .
not from each other did kalos and musides conceal their work , but the sight was for them alone .
saving theirs , no eyes beheld the two divine figures released by skillful blows from the rough blocks that had imprisoned them since the world began .
at night , as of yore , musides sought the banquet halls of tegea whilst kalos wandered alone in the olive grove .
but as time passed , men observed a want of gaiety in the once sparkling musides .
it was strange , they said amongst themselves that depression should thus seize one with so great a chance to win art loftiest reward .
many months passed yet in the sour face of musides came nothing of the sharp expectancy which the situation should arouse .
then one day musides spoke of the illness of kalos , after which none marvelled again at his sadness , since the sculptors ' attachment was known to be deep and sacred .
subsequently many went to visit kalos , and indeed noticed the pallor of his face ; but there was about him a happy serenity which made his glance more magical than the glance of musides who was clearly distracted with anxiety and who pushed aside all the slaves in his eagerness to feed and wait upon his friend with his own hands .
hidden behind heavy curtains stood the two unfinished figures of tyche , little touched of late by the sick man and his faithful attendant .
as kalos grew inexplicably weaker and weaker despite the ministrations of puzzled physicians and of his assiduous friend , he desired to be carried often to the grove which he so loved .
there he would ask to be left alone , as if wishing to speak with unseen things .
musides ever granted his requests , though his eyes filled with visible tears at the thought that kalos should care more for the fauns and the dryads than for him .
at last the end drew near , and kalos discoursed of things beyond this life .
musides , weeping , promised him a sepulchre more lovely than the tomb of mausolus ; but kalos bade him speak no more of marble glories .
only one wish now haunted the mind of the dying man ; that twigs from certain olive trees in the grove be buried by his resting place close to his head .
and one night , sitting alone in the darkness of the olive grove , kalos died .
beautiful beyond words was the marble sepulchre which stricken musides carved for his beloved friend .
none but kalos himself could have fashioned such basreliefs , wherein were displayed all the splendours of elysium .
nor did musides fail to bury close to kalos ' head the olive twigs from the grove .
as the first violence of musides ' grief gave place to resignation , he labored with diligence upon his figure of tyche .
all honour was now his , since the tyrant of syracuse would have the work of none save him or kalos .
his task proved a vent for his emotion and he toiled more steadily each day , shunning the gaieties he once had relished .
meanwhile his evenings were spent beside the tomb of his friend , where a young olive tree had sprung up near the sleeper head .
so swift was the growth of this tree , and so strange was its form , that all who beheld it exclaimed in surprise ; and musides seemed at once fascinated and repelled .
three years after the death of kalos , musides despatched a messenger to the tyrant , and it was whispered in the agora at tegea that the mighty statue was finished .
by this time the tree by the tomb had attained amazing proportions , exceeding all other trees of its kind , and sending out a singularly heavy branch above the apartment in which musides labored .
as many visitors came to view the prodigious tree , as to admire the art of the sculptor , so that musides was seldom alone .
but he did not mind his multitude of guests ; indeed , he seemed to dread being alone now that his absorbing work was done .
the bleak mountain wind , sighing through the olive grove and the , had an uncanny way of forming vaguely articulate sounds .
the sky was dark on the evening that the tyrant emissaries came to tegea .
it was definitely known that they had come to bear away the great image of tyche and bring eternal honour to musides , so their reception by the proxenoi was of great warmth .
as the night wore on a violent storm of wind broke over the crest of maenalus , and the men from far syracuse were glad that they rested snugly in the town .
they talked of their illustrious tyrant , and of the splendour of his capital and exulted in the glory of the statue which musides had wrought for him .
and then the men of tegea spoke of the goodness of musides , and of his heavy grief for his friend and how not even the coming laurels of art could console him in the absence of kalos , who might have worn those laurels instead .
of the tree which grew by the tomb , near the head of kalos , they also spoke .
the wind shrieked more horribly , and both the syracusans and the arcadians prayed to aiolos .
in the sunshine of the morning the proxenoi led the tyrant messengers up the slope to the abode of the sculptor , but the night wind had done strange things .
slaves ' cries ascended from a scene of desolation , and no more amidst the olive grove rose the gleaming colonnades of that vast hall wherein musides had dreamed and toiled .
lone and shaken mourned the humble courts and the lower walls , for upon the sumptuous greater peristyle had fallen squarely the heavy overhanging bough of the strange new tree , reducing the stately poem in marble with odd completeness to a mound of unsightly ruins .
strangers and tegeans stood aghast , looking from the wreckage to the great , sinister tree whose aspect was so weirdly human and whose roots reached so queerly into the sculptured sepulchre of kalos .
and their fear and dismay increased when they searched the fallen apartment , for of the gentle musides , and of the marvellously fashioned image of tyche , no trace could be discovered .
amidst such stupendous ruin only chaos dwelt , and the representatives of two cities left disappointed ; syracusans that they had no statue to bear home , tegeans that they had no artist to crown .
however , the syracusans obtained after a while a very splendid statue in athens , and the tegeans consoled themselves by erecting in the agora a marble temple commemorating the gifts , virtues , and brotherly piety of musides .
but the olive grove still stands , as does the tree growing out of the tomb of kalos , and the old told me that sometimes the boughs whisper to one another in the night wind , saying over and over again .
oida !
oida ! i know !
i know !
with this friend , joel manton , i had often languidly disputed .
he was principal of the east high school , born and bred in boston and sharing new england deafness to the delicate overtones of life .
it was his view that only our normal , objective experiences possess any esthetic significance , and that it is the province of the artist not so much to rouse strong emotion by action , ecstasy , and astonishment , as to maintain a placid interest and appreciation by accurate , detailed transcripts of everyday affairs .
especially did he object to my preoccupation with the mystical and the unexplained ; for although believing in the supernatural much more fully than i , he would not admit that it is sufficiently commonplace for literary treatment .
that a mind can find its greatest pleasure in escapes from the daily treadmill , and in original and dramatic recombinations of images usually thrown by habit and fatigue into the hackneyed patterns of actual existence , was something virtually incredible to his clear , practical , and logical intellect .
with him all things and feelings had fixed dimensions , properties , causes , and effects ; and although he vaguely knew that the mind sometimes holds visions and sensations of far less geometrical , classifiable , and workable nature , he believed himself justified in drawing an arbitrary line and ruling out of court all that can not be experienced and understood by the average citizen .
besides , he was almost sure that nothing can be really unnamable .
it did sound sensible to him .
though i well realized the futility of imaginative and metaphysical arguments against the complacency of an orthodox , something in the scene of this afternoon colloquy moved me to more than usual contentiousness .
the crumbling slate slabs , the patriarchal trees , and the centuried gambrel roofs of the old town that stretched around , all combined to rouse my spirit in defense of my work ; and i was soon carrying my thrusts into the enemy own country .
it was not , indeed , difficult to begin a , for i knew that joel manton actually half clung to many ' superstitions which sophisticated people had long outgrown ; beliefs in the appearance of dying persons at distant places , and in the impressions left by old faces on the windows through which they had gazed all their lives .
to credit these whisperings of rural grandmothers , i now insisted , argued a faith in the existence of spectral substances on the earth apart from and subsequent to their material counterparts .
it argued a capability of believing in phenomena beyond all normal notions ; for if a dead man can transmit his visible or tangible image half across the world , or down the stretch of the centuries , how can it be absurd to suppose that deserted houses are full of queer sentient things , or that old graveyards teem with the terrible , unbodied intelligence of generations ?
and since spirit , in order to cause all the manifestations attributed to it , can not be limited by any of the laws of matter , why is it extravagant to imagine psychically living dead things in shapes or absences of shapes which must for human spectators be utterly and appallingly unnamable ?
common sense in reflecting on these subjects , i assured my friend with some warmth , is merely a stupid absence of imagination and mental flexibility .
twilight had now approached , but neither of us felt any wish to cease speaking .
manton seemed unimpressed by my arguments , and eager to refute them , having that confidence in his own opinions which had doubtless caused his success as a teacher ; whilst i was too sure of my ground to fear defeat .
the dusk fell , and lights faintly gleamed in some of the distant windows , but we did not move .
our seat on the tomb was very comfortable , and i knew that my prosaic friend would not mind the cavernous rift in the ancient , brickwork close behind us , or the utter blackness of the spot brought by the intervention of a tottering , deserted house between us and the nearest lighted road .
there in the dark , upon that riven tomb by the deserted house , we talked on about the unnamable and after my friend had finished his scoffing i told him of the awful evidence behind the story at which he had scoffed the most .
my tale had been called the attic window , and appeared in the january , , issue of whispers .
in a good many places , especially the south and the pacific coast , they took the magazines off the stands at the complaints of silly ; but new england did get the thrill and merely shrugged its shoulders at my extravagance .
the thing , it was averred , was biologically impossible to start with ; merely another of those crazy country mutterings which cotton mather had been gullible enough to dump into his chaotic magnalia christi americana , and so poorly authenticated that even he had not ventured to name the locality where the horror occurred .
and as to the way i amplified the bare jotting of the old mystic that was quite impossible , and characteristic of a flighty and notional scribbler !
mather had indeed told of the thing as being born , but nobody but a cheap sensationalist would think of having it grow up , look into people windows at night , and be hidden in the attic of a house , in flesh and in spirit , till someone saw it at the window centuries later and could describe what it was that turned his hair gray .
all this was flagrant trashiness , and my friend manton was not slow to insist on that fact .
then i told him what i had found in an old diary kept between and , unearthed among family papers not a mile from where we were sitting ; that , and the certain reality of the scars on my ancestor chest and back which the diary described .
i told him , too , of the fears of others in that region , and how they were whispered down for generations ; and how no mythical madness came to the boy who in entered an abandoned house to examine certain traces suspected to be there .
it had been an eldritch thing no wonder sensitive students shudder at the puritan age in massachusetts .
so little is known of what went on beneath the surface so little , yet such a ghastly festering as it bubbles up putrescently in occasional ghoulish glimpses .
the witchcraft terror is a horrible ray of light on what was stewing in men crushed brains , but even that is a trifle .
there was no beauty ; no freedom we can see that from the architectural and household remains , and the poisonous sermons of the cramped divines .
and inside that rusted iron straitjacket lurked gibbering hideousness , perversion , and diabolism .
here , truly , was the apotheosis of the unnamable .
cotton mather , in that demoniac sixth book which no one should read after dark , minced no words as he flung forth his anathema .
stern as a jewish prophet , and laconically as none since his day could be , he told of the beast that had brought forth what was more than beast but less than man the thing with the blemished eye and of the screaming drunken wretch that hanged for having such an eye .
this much he baldly told , yet without a hint of what came after .
perhaps he did not know , or perhaps he knew and did not dare to tell .
others knew , but did not dare to tell there is no public hint of why they whispered about the lock on the door to the attic stairs in the house of a childless , broken , embittered old man who had put up a blank slate slab by an avoided grave , although one may trace enough evasive legends to curdle the thinnest blood .
it is all in that ancestral diary i found ; all the hushed innuendoes and furtive tales of things with a blemished eye seen at windows in the night or in deserted meadows near the woods .
something had caught my ancestor on a dark valley road , leaving him with marks of horns on his chest and of apelike claws on his back ; and when they looked for prints in the trampled dust they found the mixed marks of split hooves and vaguely anthropoid paws .
once a said he saw an old man chasing and calling to a frightful loping , nameless thing on meadow hill in the thinly moonlit hours before dawn , and many believed him .
certainly , there was strange talk one night in when the childless , broken old man was buried in the crypt behind his own house in sight of the blank slate slab .
they never unlocked that attic door , but left the whole house as it was , dreaded and deserted .
when noises came from it , they whispered and shivered ; and hoped that the lock on that attic door was strong .
then they stopped hoping when the horror occurred at the parsonage , leaving not a soul alive or in one piece .
with the years the legends take on a spectral character i suppose the thing , if it was a living thing , must have died .
the memory had lingered hideously all the more hideous because it was so secret .
during this narration my friend manton had become very silent , and i saw that my words had impressed him .
he did not laugh as i paused , but asked quite seriously about the boy who went mad in , and who had presumably been the hero of my fiction .
i told him why the boy had gone to that shunned , deserted house , and remarked that he ought to be interested , since he believed that windows retained latent images of those who had sat at them .
the boy had gone to look at the windows of that horrible attic , because of tales of things seen behind them , and had come back screaming maniacally .
manton remained thoughtful as i said this , but gradually reverted to his analytical mood .
he granted for the sake of argument that some unnatural monster had really existed , but reminded me that even the most morbid perversion of nature need not be unnamable or scientifically indescribable .
i admired his clearness and persistence , and added some further revelations i had collected among the old people .
those later spectral legends , i made plain , related to monstrous apparitions more frightful than anything organic could be ; apparitions of gigantic bestial forms sometimes visible and sometimes only tangible , which floated about on moonless nights and haunted the old house , the crypt behind it , and the grave where a sapling had sprouted beside an illegible slab .
whether or not such apparitions had ever gored or smothered people to death , as told in uncorroborated traditions , they had produced a strong and consistent impression ; and were yet darkly feared by very aged natives , though largely forgotten by the last two generations perhaps dying for lack of being thought about .
moreover , so far as esthetic theory was involved , if the psychic emanations of human creatures be grotesque distortions , what coherent representation could express or portray so gibbous and infamous a nebulosity as the specter of a malign , chaotic perversion , itself a morbid blasphemy against nature ?
molded by the dead brain of a hybrid nightmare , would not such a vaporous terror constitute in all loathsome truth the exquisitely , the shriekingly unnamable ?
the hour must now have grown very late .
a singularly noiseless bat brushed by me , and i believe it touched manton also , for although i could not see him i felt him raise his arm .
presently he spoke .
but is that house with the attic window still standing and deserted ?
yes , i answered , i have seen it .
and did you find anything there in the attic or anywhere else ?
there were some bones up under the eaves .
they may have been what that boy saw if he was sensitive he would have needed anything in the to unhinge him .
if they all came from the same object it must have been an hysterical , delirious monstrosity .
it would have been blasphemous to leave such bones in the world , so i went back with a sack and took them to the tomb behind the house .
there was an opening where i could dump them in .
do think i was a fool you ought to have seen that skull .
it had horns , but a face and jaw something like yours and mine .
at last i could feel a real shiver run through manton , who had moved very near .
but his curiosity was undeterred .
and what about the ?
they were all gone .
one window had lost its entire frame , and in all the others there was not a trace of glass in the little diamond apertures .
they were that kind the old lattice windows that went out of use before .
i do believe they had any glass for a hundred years or more maybe the boy broke if he got that far ; the legend does say .
manton was reflecting again .
i like to see that house , carter .
where is it ?
glass or no glass , i must explore it a little .
and the tomb where you put those bones , and the other grave without an inscription the whole thing must be a bit terrible .
you did see it until it got dark .
my friend was more wrought upon than i had suspected , for at this touch of harmless theatricalism he started neurotically away from me and actually cried out with a sort of gulping gasp which released a strain of previous repression .
it was an odd cry , and all the more terrible because it was answered .
for as it was still echoing , i heard a creaking sound through the pitchy blackness , and knew that a lattice window was opening in that accursed old house beside us .
and because all the other frames were long since fallen , i knew that it was the grisly glassless frame of that demoniac attic window .
then came a noxious rush of noisome , frigid air from that same dreaded direction , followed by a piercing shriek just beside me on that shocking rifted tomb of man and monster .
in another instant i was knocked from my gruesome bench by the devilish threshing of some unseen entity of titanic size but undetermined nature ; knocked sprawling on the mold of that abhorrent graveyard , while from the tomb came such a stifled uproar of gasping and whirring that my fancy peopled the rayless gloom with miltonic legions of the misshapen damned .
there was a vortex of withering , wind , and then the rattle of loose bricks and plaster ; but i had mercifully fainted before i could learn what it meant .
manton , though smaller than i , is more resilient ; for we opened our eyes at almost the same instant , despite his greater injuries .
our couches were side by side , and we knew in a few seconds that we were in mary hospital .
attendants were grouped about in tense curiosity , eager to aid our memory by telling us how we came there , and we soon heard of the farmer who had found us at noon in a lonely field beyond meadow hill , a mile from the old burying ground , on a spot where an ancient slaughterhouse is reputed to have stood .
manton had two malignant wounds in the chest , and some less severe cuts or gougings in the back .
i was not so seriously hurt , but was covered with welts and contusions of the most bewildering character , including the print of a split hoof .
it was plain that manton knew more than i , but he told nothing to the puzzled and interested physicians till he had learned what our injuries were .
then he said we were the victims of a vicious bull though the animal was a difficult thing to place and account for .
after the doctors and nurses had left , i whispered an awe struck question good god , manton , but what was it ?
those scars was it like that ?
and i was too dazed to exult when he whispered back a thing i had half expected no it was that way at all .
it was everywhere a gelatin a slime yet it had shapes , a thousand shapes of horror beyond all memory .
there were eyes and a blemish .
it was the pit the maelstrom the ultimate abomination .
carter , it was the unnamable !
i am basil elton , keeper of the north point light that my father and grandfather kept before me .
far from the shore stands the gray lighthouse , above sunken slimy rocks that are seen when the tide is low , but unseen when the tide is high .
past that beacon for a century have swept the majestic barques of the seven seas .
in the days of my grandfather there were many ; in the days of my father not so many ; and now there are so few that i sometimes feel strangely alone , as though i were the last man on our planet .
from far shores came those argosies of old ; from far eastern shores where warm suns shine and sweet odors linger about strange gardens and gay temples .
the old captains of the sea came often to my grandfather and told him of these things which in turn he told to my father , and my father told to me in the long autumn evenings when the wind howled eerily from the east .
and i have read more of these things , and of many things besides , in the books men gave me when i was young and filled with wonder .
but more wonderful than the lore of old men and the lore of books is the secret lore of ocean .
blue , green , gray , white or black ; smooth , ruffled , or mountainous ; that ocean is not silent .
all my days have i watched it and listened to it , and i know it well .
at first it told to me only the plain little tales of calm beaches and near ports , but with the years it grew more friendly and spoke of other things ; of things more strange and more distant in space and time .
sometimes at twilight the gray vapors of the horizon have parted to grant me glimpses of the ways beyond ; and sometimes at night the deep waters of the sea have grown clear and phosphorescent , to grant me glimpses of the ways beneath .
and these glimpses have been as often of the ways that were and the ways that might be , as of the ways that are ; for ocean is more ancient than the mountains , and freighted with the memories and the dreams of time .
out of the south it was that the white ship used to come when the moon was full and high in the heavens .
out of the south it would glide very smoothly and silently over the sea .
and whether the sea was rough or calm , and whether the wind was friendly or adverse , it would always glide smoothly and silently , its sails distant and its long strange tiers of oars moving rhythmically .
one night i espied upon the deck a man , bearded and robed , and he seemed to beckon me to embark for far unknown shores .
many times afterward i saw him under the full moon , and ever did he beckon me .
very brightly did the moon shine on the night i answered the call , and i walked out over the waters to the white ship on a bridge of moonbeams .
the man who had beckoned now spoke a welcome to me in a soft language i seemed to know well , and the hours were filled with soft songs of the oarsmen as we glided away into a mysterious south , golden with the glow of that full , mellow moon .
and when the day dawned , rosy and effulgent , i beheld the green shore of far lands , bright and beautiful , and to me unknown .
up from the sea rose lordly terraces of verdure , , and shewing here and there the gleaming white roofs and colonnades of strange temples .
as we drew nearer the green shore the bearded man told me of that land , the land of zar , where dwell all the dreams and thoughts of beauty that come to men once and then are forgotten .
and when i looked upon the terraces again i saw that what he said was true , for among the sights before me were many things i had once seen through the mists beyond the horizon and in the phosphorescent depths of ocean .
there too were forms and fantasies more splendid than any i had ever known ; the visions of young poets who died in want before the world could learn of what they had seen and dreamed .
but we did not set foot upon the sloping meadows of zar , for it is told that he who treads them may nevermore return to his native shore .
as the white ship sailed silently away from the templed terraces of zar , we beheld on the distant horizon ahead the spires of a mighty city ; and the bearded man said to me , this is thalarion , the city of a thousand wonders , wherein reside all those mysteries that man has striven in vain to fathom .
and i looked again , at closer range , and saw that the city was greater than any city i had known or dreamed of before .
into the sky the spires of its temples reached , so that no man might behold their peaks ; and far back beyond the horizon stretched the grim , gray walls , over which one might spy only a few roofs , weird and ominous , yet adorned with rich friezes and alluring sculptures .
i yearned mightily to enter this fascinating yet repellent city , and besought the bearded man to land me at the stone pier by the huge carven gate akariel ; but he gently denied my wish , saying , into thalarion , the city of a thousand wonders , many have passed but none returned .
therein walk only daemons and mad things that are no longer men , and the streets are white with the unburied bones of those who have looked upon the eidolon lathi , that reigns over the city .
so the white ship sailed on past the walls of thalarion , and followed for many days a bird , whose glossy plumage matched the sky out of which it had appeared .
then came we to a pleasant coast gay with blossoms of every hue , where as far inland as we could see basked lovely groves and radiant arbors beneath a meridian sun .
from bowers beyond our view came bursts of song and snatches of lyric harmony , interspersed with faint laughter so delicious that i urged the rowers onward in my eagerness to reach the scene .
and the bearded man spoke no word , but watched me as we approached the shore .
suddenly a wind blowing from over the flowery meadows and leafy woods brought a scent at which i trembled .
the wind grew stronger , and the air was filled with the lethal , charnel odor of towns and uncovered cemeteries .
and as we sailed madly away from that damnable coast the bearded man spoke at last , saying , this is xura , the land of pleasures unattained .
so once more the white ship followed the bird of heaven , over warm blessed seas fanned by caressing , aromatic breezes .
day after day and night after night did we sail , and when the moon was full we would listen to soft songs of the oarsmen , sweet as on that distant night when we sailed away from my far native land .
and it was by moonlight that we anchored at last in the harbor of , which is guarded by twin headlands of crystal that rise from the sea and meet in a resplendent arch .
this is the land of fancy , and we walked to the verdant shore upon a golden bridge of moonbeams .
in the land of there is neither time nor space , neither suffering nor death ; and there i dwelt for many aeons .
green are the groves and pastures , bright and fragrant the flowers , blue and musical the streams , clear and cool the fountains , and stately and gorgeous the temples , castles , and cities of .
of that land there is no bound , for beyond each vista of beauty rises another more beautiful .
over the countryside and amidst the splendor of cities can move at will the happy folk , of whom all are gifted with unmarred grace and unalloyed happiness .
for the aeons that i dwelt there i wandered blissfully through gardens where quaint pagodas peep from pleasing clumps of bushes , and where the white walks are bordered with delicate blossoms .
i climbed gentle hills from whose summits i could see entrancing panoramas of loveliness , with steepled towns nestling in verdant valleys , and with the golden domes of gigantic cities glittering on the infinitely distant horizon .
and i viewed by moonlight the sparkling sea , the crystal headlands , and the placid harbor wherein lay anchored the white ship .
it was against the full moon one night in the immemorial year of tharp that i saw outlined the beckoning form of the celestial bird , and felt the first stirrings of unrest .
then i spoke with the bearded man , and told him of my new yearnings to depart for remote cathuria , which no man hath seen , but which all believe to lie beyond the basalt pillars of the west .
it is the land of hope , and in it shine the perfect ideals of all that we know elsewhere ; or at least so men relate .
but the bearded man said to me , beware of those perilous seas wherein men say cathuria lies .
in there is no pain or death , but who can tell what lies beyond the basalt pillars of the west ?
natheless at the next full moon i boarded the white ship , and with the reluctant bearded man left the happy harbor for untraveled seas .
and the bird of heaven flew before , and led us toward the basalt pillars of the west , but this time the oarsmen sang no soft songs under the full moon .
in my mind i would often picture the unknown land of cathuria with its splendid groves and palaces , and would wonder what new delights there awaited me .
cathuria , i would say to myself , is the abode of gods and the land of unnumbered cities of gold .
its forests are of aloe and sandalwood , even as the fragrant groves of camorin , and among the trees flutter gay birds sweet with song .
on the green and flowery mountains of cathuria stand temples of pink marble , rich with carven and painted glories , and having in their courtyards cool fountains of silver , where purr with ravishing music the scented waters that come from the river narg .
and the cities of cathuria are cinctured with golden walls , and their pavements also are of gold .
in the gardens of these cities are strange orchids , and perfumed lakes whose beds are of coral and amber .
at night the streets and the gardens are lit with gay lanthorns fashioned from the three colored shell of the tortoise , and here resound the soft notes of the singer and the lutanist .
and the houses of the cities of cathuria are all palaces , each built over a fragrant canal bearing the waters of the sacred narg .
of marble and porphyry are the houses , and roofed with glittering gold that reflects the rays of the sun and enhances the splendor of the cities as blissful gods view them from the distant peaks .
fairest of all is the palace of the great monarch dorieb , whom some say to be a and others a god .
high is the palace of dorieb , and many are the turrets of marble upon its walls .
in its wide halls many multitudes assemble , and here hang the trophies of the ages .
and the roof is of pure gold , set upon tall pillars of ruby and azure , and having such carven figures of gods and heroes that he who looks up to those heights seems to gaze upon the living olympus .
and the floor of the palace is of glass , under which flow the cunningly lighted waters of the narg , gay with gaudy fish not known beyond the bounds of lovely cathuria .
thus would i speak to myself of cathuria , but ever would the bearded man warn me to turn back to the happy shore of ; for is known of men , while none hath ever beheld cathuria .
and on the day that we followed the bird , we beheld the basalt pillars of the west .
shrouded in mist they were , so that no man might peer beyond them or see their summits which indeed some say reach even to the heavens .
and the bearded man again implored me to turn back , but i heeded him not ; for from the mists beyond the basalt pillars i fancied there came the notes of singers and lutanists ; sweeter than the sweetest songs of , and sounding mine own praises ; the praises of me , who had voyaged far from the full moon and dwelt in the land of fancy .
so to the sound of melody the white ship sailed into the mist betwixt the basalt pillars of the west .
and when the music ceased and the mist lifted , we beheld not the land of cathuria , but a resistless sea , over which our helpless barque was borne toward some unknown goal .
soon to our ears came the distant thunder of falling waters , and to our eyes appeared on the far horizon ahead the titanic spray of a monstrous cataract , wherein the oceans of the world drop down to abysmal nothingness .
then did the bearded man say to me , with tears on his cheek , we have rejected the beautiful land of , which we may never behold again .
the gods are greater than men , and they have conquered .
and i closed my eyes before the crash that i knew would come , shutting out the sight of the celestial bird which flapped its mocking blue wings over the brink of the torrent .
out of that crash came darkness , and i heard the shrieking of men and of things which were not men .
from the east tempestuous winds arose , and chilled me as i crouched on the slab of damp stone which had risen beneath my feet .
then as i heard another crash i opened my eyes and beheld myself upon the platform of that lighthouse whence i had sailed so many aeons ago .
in the darkness below there loomed the vast blurred outlines of a vessel breaking up on the cruel rocks , and as i glanced out over the waste i saw that the light had failed for the first time since my grandfather had assumed its care .
and in the later watches of the night , when i went within the tower , i saw on the wall a calendar which still remained as when i had left it at the hour i sailed away .
with the dawn i descended the tower and looked for wreckage upon the rocks , but what i found was only this a strange dead bird whose hue was as of the azure sky , and a single shattered spar , of a whiteness greater than that of the or of the mountain snow .
and thereafter the ocean told me its secrets no more ; and though many times since has the moon shone full and high in the heavens , the white ship from the south came never again .
chapter one in a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and carpeted with bonkhata rugs of impressive age and workmanship , four men were sitting around a table .
from the far corners , where odd tripods of wrought iron were now and then replenished by an incredibly aged negro in somber livery , came the hypnotic fumes of olibanum ; while in a deep niche on one side there ticked a curious , coffin shaped clock whose dial bore baffling hieroglyphs and whose four hands did not move in consonance with any time system known on this planet .
it was a singular and disturbing room , but well fitted to the business then at hand .
for there , in the new orleans home of this continent greatest mystic , mathematician and orientalist , there was being settled at last the estate of a scarcely less great mystic , scholar , author and dreamer who had vanished from the face of the earth four years before .
randolph carter , who had all his life sought to escape from the tedium and limitations of waking reality in the beckoning vistas of dreams and fabled avenues of other dimensions , disappeared from the sight of man on the seventh of october , , at the age of .
his career had been a strange and lonely one , and there were those who inferred from his curious novels many episodes more bizarre than any in his recorded history .
his association with harley warren , the south carolina mystic whose studies in the primal naacal language of the himalayan priests had led to such outrageous conclusions , had been close .
indeed , it was he who one , terrible night in an ancient graveyard had seen warren descend into a dank and nitrous vault , never to emerge .
carter lived in boston , but it was from the wild , haunted hills behind hoary and arkham that all his forebears had come .
and it was amid these ancient , cryptically brooding hills that he had ultimately vanished .
his old servant , parks who died early in had spoken of the strangely aromatic and hideously carven box he had found in the attic , and of the indecipherable parchments and queerly figured silver key which that box had contained matters of which carter had also written to others .
carter , he said , had told him that this key had come down from his ancestors , and that it would help him to unlock the gates to his lost boyhood , and to strange dimensions and fantastic realms which he had hitherto visited only in vague , brief , and elusive dreams .
then one day carter took the box and its contents and rode away in his car , never to return .
later on , people found the car at the side of an old , road in the hills behind crumbling arkham the hills where carter forebears had once dwelt , and where the ruined cellar of the great carter homestead still gaped to the sky .
it was in a grove of tall elms nearby that another of the carters had mysteriously vanished in , and not far away was the cottage where goody fowler , the witch , had brewed her ominous potions still earlier .
the region had been settled in by fugitives from the witchcraft trials in salem , and even now it bore a name for vaguely ominous things scarcely to be envisaged .
edmund carter had fled from the shadow of gallows hill just in time , and the tales of his sorceries were many .
now , it seemed , his lone descendant had gone somewhere to join him !
in the car they found the hideously carved box of fragrant wood , and the parchment which no man could read .
the silver key was gone presumably with carter .
further than that there was no certain clue .
detectives from boston said that the fallen timbers of the old carter place seemed oddly disturbed , and somebody found a handkerchief on the , sinisterly wooded slope behind the ruins near the dreaded cave called the snake den .
it was then that the country legends about the snake den gained a new vitality .
farmers whispered of the blasphemous uses to which old edmund carter the wizard had put that horrible grotto , and added later tales about the fondness which randolph carter himself had had for it when a boy .
in carter boyhood the venerable homestead was still standing and tenanted by his christopher .
he had visited there often , and had talked singularly about the snake den .
people remembered what he had said about a deep fissure and an unknown inner cave beyond , and speculated on the change he had shown after spending one whole memorable day in the cavern when he was nine .
that was in october , too and ever after that he had seemed to have a uncanny knack at prophesying future events .
it had rained late in the night that carter vanished , and no one was quite able to trace his footprints from the car .
inside the snake den all was amorphous liquid mud , owing to the copious seepage .
only the ignorant rustics whispered about the prints they thought they spied where the great elms overhang the road , and on the sinister hillside near the snake den , where the handkerchief was found .
who could pay attention to whispers that spoke of stubby little tracks like those which randolph carter boots made when he was a small boy ?
it was as crazy a notion as that other whisper that the tracks of old benijah corey peculiar heelless boots had met the stubby little tracks in the road .
old benijah had been the carters ' hired man when randolph was young ; but he had died thirty years ago .
it must have been these whispers plus carter own statement to parks and others that the queerly arabesqued silver key would help him unlock the gates of his lost boyhood which caused a number of mystical students to declare that the missing man had actually doubled back on the trail of time and returned through years to that other october day in when he had stayed in the snake den as a small boy .
when he came out that night , they argued , he had somehow made the whole trip to and back ; for did he not thereafter know of things which were to happen later ?
and yet he had never spoken of anything to happen after .
one student an elderly eccentric of providence , rhode island , who had enjoyed a long and close correspondence with carter had a still more elaborate theory , and believed that carter had not only returned to boyhood , but achieved a further liberation , roving at will through the prismatic vistas of boyhood dream .
after a strange vision this man published a tale of carter vanishing in which he hinted that the lost one now reigned as king on the opal throne of , that fabulous town of turrets atop the hollow cliffs of glass overlooking the twilight sea wherein the bearded and finny gniorri build their singular labyrinths .
it was this old man , ward phillips , who pleaded most loudly against the apportionment of carter estate to his heirs all distant cousins on the ground that he was still alive in another time dimension and might well return some day .
against him was arrayed the legal talent of one of the cousins , ernest aspinwall of chicago , a man ten years carter senior , but keen as a youth in forensic battles .
for four years the contest had raged , but now the time for apportionment had come , and this vast , strange room in new orleans was to be the scene of the arrangement .
it was the home of carter literary and financial executor the distinguished creole student of mysteries and eastern antiquities , de marigny .
carter had met de marigny during the war , when they both served in the french foreign legion , and had at once cleaved to him because of their similar tastes and outlook .
when , on a memorable joint furlough , the learned young creole had taken the wistful boston dreamer to bayonne , in the south of france , and had shown him certain terrible secrets in the nighted and immemorial crypts that burrow beneath that brooding , city , the friendship was forever sealed .
carter will had named de marigny as executor , and now that avid scholar was reluctantly presiding over the settlement of the estate .
it was sad work for him , for like the old rhode islander he did not believe that carter was dead .
but what weight had the dreams of mystics against the harsh wisdom of the world ?
around the table in that strange room in the old french quarter sat the men who claimed an interest in the proceedings .
there had been the usual legal advertisements of the conference in papers wherever carter heirs were thought to live ; yet only four now sat listening to the abnormal ticking of that clock which told no earthly time , and to the bubbling of the courtyard fountain beyond , windows .
as the hours wore on , the faces of the four were half shrouded in the curling fumes from the tripods , which , piled recklessly with fuel , seemed to need less and less attention from the silently gliding and increasingly nervous old negro .
there was etienne de marigny himself slim , dark , handsome , mustached , and still young .
aspinwall , representing the heirs , was , , , and portly .
phillips , the providence mystic , was lean , gray , , , and stoop shouldered .
the fourth man was in age lean , with a dark , bearded , singularly immobile face of very regular contour , bound with the turban of a brahman and having , burning , almost irisless eyes which seemed to gaze out from a vast distance behind the features .
he had announced himself as the swami chandraputra , an adept from benares , with important information to give ; and both de marigny and phillips who had corresponded with him had been quick to recognize the genuineness of his mystical pretensions .
his speech had an oddly forced , hollow , metallic quality , as if the use of english taxed his vocal apparatus ; yet his language was as easy , correct and idiomatic as any native .
in general attire he was the normal european civilian , but his loose clothes sat peculiarly badly on him , while his bushy black beard , eastern turban , and large , white mittens gave him an air of exotic eccentricity .
de marigny , fingering the parchment found in carter car , was speaking .
no , i have not been able to make anything of the parchment .
phillips , here , also gives it up .
colonel churchward declares it is not naacal , and it looks nothing at all like the hieroglyphics on that easter island .
the carvings on that box , though , do strangely suggest easter island images .
the nearest thing i can recall to these parchment characters notice how all the letters seem to hang down from horizontal is the writing in a book poor harley warren once had .
it came from india while carter and i were visiting him in , and he never would tell us anything about it said it would be better if we did know , and hinted that it might have come originally from some place other than the earth .
he took it with him in december , when he went down into the vault in that old graveyard but neither he nor the book ever came to the surface again .
some time ago i sent our friend here the swami chandraputra a of some of those letters , and also a photostatic copy of the carter parchment .
he believes he may be able to shed light on them after certain references and consultations .
but the key carter sent me a photograph of that .
its curious arabesques were not letters , but seem to have belonged to the same as the parchment .
carter always spoke of being on the point of solving the mystery , though he never gave details .
once he grew almost poetic about the whole business .
that antique silver key , he said , would unlock the successive doors that bar our free march down the mighty corridors of space and time to the very border which no man has crossed since shaddad with his terrific genius built and concealed in the sands of arabia pettraea the prodigious domes and uncounted minarets of irem .
dervishes wrote carter and nomads have returned to tell of that monumental portal , and of the hand that is sculptured above the keystone of the arch , but no man has passed and retraced his steps to say that his footprints on the sands within bear witness to his visit .
the key , he surmised , was that for which the cyclopean sculptured hand vainly grasps .
why carter did take the parchment as well as the key , we can not say .
perhaps he forgot it or perhaps he forbore to take it through recollection of one who had taken a book of like characters into a vault and never returned .
or perhaps it was really immaterial to what he wished to do .
as de marigny paused , old phillips spoke a harsh , shrill voice .
we can know of randolph carter wandering only what we dream .
i have been to many strange places in dreams , and have heard many strange and significant things in ulthar , beyond the river skai .
it does not appear that the parchment was needed , for certainly carter reentered the world of his boyhood dreams , and is now a king in .
aspinwall grew doubly as he sputtered ca somebody shut the old fool up ?
we had enough of these moonings .
the problem is to divide the property , and it about time we got to it .
for the first time swami chandraputra spoke in his queerly alien voice .
gentlemen , there is more to this matter than you think .
aspinwall does not do well to laugh at the evidence of dreams .
phillips has taken an incomplete view perhaps because he has not dreamed enough .
i , myself , have done much dreaming .
we in india have always done that , just as all the carters seem to have done it .
you , aspinwall , as a maternal cousin , are naturally not a carter .
my own dreams , and certain other sources of information , have told me a great deal which you still find obscure .
for example , randolph carter forgot that parchment which he could decipher yet it would have been well for him had he remembered to take it .
you see , i have really learned pretty much what happened to carter after he left his car with the silver key at sunset on that seventh of october , four years ago .
aspinwall audibly sneered , but the others sat up with heightened interest .
the smoke from the tripods increased , and the crazy ticking of that clock seemed to fall into bizarre patterns like the dots and dashes of some alien and insoluble telegraph message from outer space .
the hindoo leaned back , half closed his eyes , and continued in that oddly labored yet idiomatic speech , while before his audience there began to float a picture of what had happened to randolph carter .
chapter two the hills beyond arkham are full of a strange magic something , perhaps , which the old wizard edmund carter called down from the stars and up from the crypts of nether earth when he fled there from salem in .
as soon as randolph carter was back among them he knew that he was close to one of the gates which a few audacious , abhorred and men have blasted through titan walls betwixt the world and the outside absolute .
here , he felt , and on this day of the year , he could carry out with success the message he had deciphered months before from the arabesques of that tarnished and incredibly ancient silver key .
he knew now how it must be rotated , and how it must be held up to the setting sun , and what syllables of ceremony must be intoned into the void at the ninth and last turning .
in a spot as close to a dark polarity and induced gate as this , it could not fail in its primary functions .
certainly , he would rest that night in the lost boyhood for which he had never ceased to mourn .
he got out of the car with the key in his pocket , walking deeper and deeper into the shadowy core of that brooding , haunted countryside of winding road , stone wall , black woodland , gnarled , neglected orchard , , deserted , and nameless nun .
at the sunset hour , when the distant spires of kingsport gleamed in the ruddy blaze , he took out the key and made the needed turnings and intonations .
only later did he realize how soon the ritual had taken effect .
then in the deepening twilight he had heard a voice out of the past old benijah corey , his hired man .
had not old benijah been dead for thirty years ?
thirty years before when .
what was time ?
where had he been ?
why was it strange that benijah should be calling him on this seventh of october ?
was he not out later than aunt martha had told him to stay ?
what was this key in his blouse pocket , where his little telescope given him by his father on his ninth birthday , two months before ought to be ?
had he found it in the attic at home ?
would it unlock the mystic pylon which his sharp eye had traced amidst the jagged rocks at the back of that inner cave behind the snake den on the hill ?
that was the place they always coupled with old edmund carter the wizard .
people would go there , and nobody but him had ever noticed or squirmed through the fissure to that great black inner chamber with the pylon .
whose hands had carved that hint of a pylon out of the living rock ?
old wizard edmund or others that he had conjured up and commanded ?
that evening little randolph ate supper with uncle chris and aunt martha in the old .
next morning he was up early and out through the apple orchard to the upper timber lot where the mouth of the snake den lurked black and forbidding amongst grotesque , overnourished oaks .
a nameless expectancy was upon him , and he did not even notice the loss of his handkerchief as he fumbled in his blouse pocket to see if the queer silver key was safe .
he crawled through the dark orifice with tense , adventurous assurance , lighting his way with matches taken from the .
in another moment he had wriggled through the root choked fissure at the farther end , and was in the vast , unknown inner grotto whose ultimate rock wall seemed half like a monstrous and consciously shapen pylon .
before that dank , dripping wall he stood silent and awestruck , lighting one match after another as he gazed .
was that stony bulge above the keystone of the imagined arch really a gigantic sculptured hand ?
then he drew forth the silver key , and made motions and intonations whose source he could only dimly remember .
was anything forgotten ?
he knew only that he wished to cross the barrier to the untrammeled land of his dreams and the gulfs where all dimensions dissolved in the absolute .
chapter three what happened then is scarcely to be described in words .
it is full of those paradoxes , contradictions and anomalies which have no place in waking life , but which fill our more fantastic dreams and are taken as matters of course till we return to our narrow , rigid , objective world of limited causation and logic .
as the hindoo continued his tale , he had difficulty in avoiding what seemed even more than the notion of a man transferred through the years to boyhood an air of trivial , puerile extravagance .
aspinwall , in disgust , gave an apoplectic snort and virtually stopped listening .
for the rite of the silver key , as practiced by randolph carter in that black , haunted cave within a cave , did not prove unavailing .
from the first gesture and syllable an aura of strange , awesome mutation was apparent a sense of incalculable disturbance and confusion in time and space , yet one which held no hint of what we recognize as motion and duration .
imperceptibly , such things as age and location ceased to have any significance whatever .
the day before , randolph carter had miraculously leaped a gulf of years .
now there was no distinction between boy and man .
there was only the entity randolph carter , with a certain store of images which had lost all connection with terrestrial scenes and circumstances of acquisition .
a moment before , there had been an inner cave with vague suggestions of a monstrous arch and gigantic sculptured hand on the farther wall .
now there was neither cave nor absence of cave ; neither wall nor absence of wall .
there was only a flux of impressions not so much visual as cerebral , amidst which the entity that was randolph carter experienced perceptions or registrations of all that his mind revolved on , yet without any clear consciousness of the way in which he received them .
by the time the rite was over , carter knew that he was in no region whose place could be told by earth geographers , and in no age whose date history could fix ; for the nature of what was happening was not wholly unfamiliar to him .
there were hints of it in the cryptical pnakotic fragments , and a whole chapter in the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab , abdul alhazred , had taken on significance when he had deciphered the designs graven on the silver key .
a gate had been unlocked not , indeed , the ultimate gate , but one leading from earth and time to that extension of earth which is outside time , and from which in turn the ultimate gate leads fearsomely and perilously to the last void which is outside all earths , all universes , and all matter .
there would be a guide and a very terrible one ; a guide who had been an entity of earth millions of years before , when man was undreamed of , and when forgotten shapes moved on a steaming planet building strange cities among whose last , crumbling ruins the first mammals were to play .
carter remembered what the monstrous necronomicon had vaguely and disconcertingly adumbrated concerning that guide and while there are those , the mad arab had written , who have dared to seek glimpses beyond the veil , and to accept as guide , they would have been more prudent had they avoided commerce with ; for it is written in the book of thoth how terrific is the price of a single glimpse .
nor may those who pass ever return , for in the vastnesses transcending our world are shapes of darkness that seize and bind .
the affair that shambleth about in the night , the evil that defieth the elder sign , the herd that stand watch at the secret portal each tomb is known to have and that thrive on that which groweth out of the tenants thereof all these blacknesses are lesser than guardeth the gateway will guide the rash one beyond all the worlds into the abyss of unnamable devourers .
for he is , the most ancient one , which the scribe rendereth as .
memory and imagination shaped dim with uncertain outlines amidst the seething chaos , but carter knew that they were of memory and imagination only .
yet he felt that it was not chance which built these things in his consciousness , but rather some vast reality , ineffable and undimensioned , which surrounded him and strove to translate itself into the only symbols he was capable of grasping .
for no mind of earth may grasp the extensions of shape which interweave in the oblique gulfs outside time and the dimensions we know .
there floated before carter a cloudy pageantry of shapes and scenes which he somehow linked with earth primal , past .
monstrous living things moved deliberately through vistas of fantastic handiwork that no sane dream ever held , and landscapes bore incredible vegetation and cliffs and mountains and masonry of no human pattern .
there were cities under the sea , and denizens thereof ; and towers in great deserts where globes and cylinders and nameless winged entities shot off into space , or hurtled down out of space .
all this carter grasped , though the images bore no fixed relation to one another or to him .
he himself had no stable form or position , but only such shifting hints of form and position as his whirling fancy supplied .
he had wished to find the enchanted regions of his boyhood dreams , where galleys sail up the river oukranos past the gilded spires of thran , and elephant caravans tramp through perfumed jungles in kied , beyond forgotten palaces with veined ivory columns that sleep lovely and unbroken under the moon .
now , intoxicated with wider visions , he scarcely knew what he sought .
thoughts of infinite and blasphemous daring rose in his mind , and he knew he would face the dreaded guide without fear , asking monstrous and terrible things of him .
all at once the pageant of impressions seemed to achieve a vague kind of stabilization .
there were great masses of towering stone , carven into alien and incomprehensible designs and disposed according to the laws of some unknown , inverse geometry .
light filtered from a sky of no assignable colour in baffling , contradictory directions , and played almost sentiently over what seemed to be a curved line of gigantic hieroglyphed pedestals more hexagonal than otherwise , and surmounted by cloaked , shapes .
there was another shape , too , which occupied no pedestal , but which seemed to glide or float over the cloudy , lower level .
it was not exactly permanent in outline , but held transient suggestions of something remotely preceding or paralleling the human form , though half as large again as an ordinary man .
it seemed to be heavily cloaked , like the shapes on the pedestals , with some fabric ; and carter could not detect any through which it might gaze .
probably it did not need to gaze , for it seemed to belong to an order of beings far outside the merely physical in organization and faculties .
a moment later carter knew that this was so , for the shape had spoken to his mind without sound or language .
and though the name it uttered was a dreaded and terrible one , randolph carter did not flinch in fear .
instead , he spoke back , equally without sound or language , and made those obeisances which the hideous necronomicon had taught him to make .
for this shape was nothing less than that which all the world has feared since lomar rose out of the sea , and the children of the fire mist came to earth to teach the elder lore to man .
it was indeed the frightful guide and guardian of the gate , the ancient one , which the scribe rendereth the .
the guide knew , as he knew all things , of carter quest and coming , and that this seeker of dreams and secrets stood before him unafraid .
there was no horror or malignity in what he radiated , and carter wondered for a moment whether the mad arab terrific blasphemous hints came from envy and a baffled wish to do what was now about to be done .
or perhaps the guide reserved his horror and malignity for those who feared .
as the radiations continued , carter eventually interpreted them in the form of words .
i am indeed that most ancient one , said the guide , of whom you know .
we have awaited you the ancient ones and i .
you are welcome , even though long delayed .
you have the key , and have unlocked the first gate .
now the ultimate gate is ready for your trial .
if you fear , you need not advance .
you may still go back unharmed , the way you came .
but if you chose to advance the pause was ominous , but the radiations continued to be friendly .
carter hesitated not a moment , for a burning curiosity drove him on .
i will advance , he radiated back , and i accept you as my guide .
at this reply the guide seemed to make a sign by certain motions of his robe which may or may not have involved the lifting of an arm or some homologous member .
a second sign followed , and from his lore carter knew that he was at last very close to the ultimate gate .
the light now changed to another inexplicable colour , and the shapes on the pedestals became more clearly defined .
as they sat more erect , their outlines became more like those of men , though carter knew that they could not be men .
upon their cloaked heads there now seemed to rest tall , uncertainly coloured miters , strangely suggestive of those on certain nameless figures chiseled by a forgotten sculptor along the living cliffs of a high , forbidden mountain in tartary ; while grasped in certain folds of their swathings were long sceptres whose carven heads bodied forth a grotesque and archaic mystery .
carter guessed what they were and whence they came , and whom they served ; and guessed , too , the price of their service .
but he was still content , for at one mighty venture he was to learn all .
damnation , he reflected , is but a word bandied about by those whose blindness leads them to condemn all who can see , even with a single eye .
he wondered at the vast conceit of those who had babbled of the malignant ancient ones , as if they could pause from their everlasting dreams to wreak a wrath on mankind .
as well , he might a mammoth pause to visit frantic vengeance on an angleworm .
now the whole assemblage on the vaguely hexagonal pillars was greeting him with a gesture of those oddly carven sceptres and radiating a message which he understood we salute you , most ancient one , and you , randolph carter , whose daring has made you one of us .
carter saw now that one of the pedestals was vacant , and a gesture of the most ancient one told him it was reserved for him .
he saw also another pedestal , taller than the rest , and at the center of the oddly curved line neither semicircle nor ellipse , parabola nor hyperbola which they formed , this , he guessed , was the guide own throne .
moving and rising in a manner hardly definable , carter took his seat ; and as he did so he saw that the guide had seated himself .
gradually and mistily it became apparent that the most ancient one was holding something some object clutched in the outflung folds of his robe as if for the sight , or what answered for sight , of the cloaked companions .
it was a large sphere , or apparent sphere , of some obscurely iridescent metal , and as the guide put it forward a low , pervasive of sound began to rise and fall in intervals which seemed to be rhythmic even though they followed no rhythm of earth .
there was a suggestion of chanting or what human imagination might interpret as chanting .
presently the began to grow luminous , and as it gleamed up into a cold , pulsating light of unassignable colour , carter saw that its flickerings conformed to the alien rhythm of the chant .
then all the mitered , shapes on the pedestals commenced a slight , curious swaying in the same inexplicable rhythm , while nimbuses of unclassifiable light resembling that of the played around their shrouded heads .
the hindoo paused in his tale and looked curiously at the tall , clock with the four hands and hieroglyphed dial , whose crazy ticking followed no known rhythm of earth .
you , de marigny , he suddenly said to his learned host , do not need to be told the particularly alien rhythm to which those cowled shapes on the hexagonal pillars chanted and nodded .
you are the only one else in america who has had a taste of the outer extension .
that clock i suppose it was sent to you by the yogi poor harley warren used to talk about the seer who said that he alone of living men had been to , the hidden legacy of leng , and had borne certain things away from that dreadful and forbidden city .
i wonder how many of its subtler properties you know ?
if my dreams and readings be correct , it was made by those who knew much of the first gateway .
but let me go on with my tale .
at last , continued the swami , the swaying and the suggestion of chanting ceased , the lambent nimbuses around the now drooping and motionless heads faded , while the cloaked shapes slumped curiously on their pedestals .
the , however , continued to pulsate with inexplicable light .
carter felt that the ancient ones were sleeping as they had been when he first saw them , and he wondered out of what cosmic dreams his coming had aroused them .
slowly there filtered into his mind the truth that this strange chanting ritual had been one of instruction , and that the companions had been chanted by the most ancient one into a new and peculiar kind of sleep in order that their dreams might open the ultimate gate to which the silver key was a passport .
he knew that in the profundity of this deep sleep they were contemplating unplumbed vastnesses of utter and absolute outsideness , and that they were to accomplish that which his presence had demanded .
the guide did not share this sleep , but seemed still to be giving instructions in some subtle , soundless way .
evidently he was implanting images of those things which he wished the companions to dream and carter knew that as each of the ancient ones pictured the prescribed thought , there would be born the nucleus of a manifestation visible to his earthly eyes .
when the dreams of all the shapes had achieved a oneness , that manifestation would occur , and everything he required be materialized , through concentration .
he had seen such things on earth in india , where the combined , projected will of a circle of adepts can make a thought take tangible substance , and in hoary atlaanat , of which few even dare speak .
just what the ultimate gate was , and how it was to be passed , carter could not be certain ; but a feeling of tense expectancy surged over him .
he was conscious of having a kind of body , and of holding the fateful silver key in his hand .
the masses of towering stone opposite him seemed to possess the evenness of a wall , toward the centre of which his eyes were irresistibly drawn .
and then suddenly he felt the mental currents of the most ancient one cease to flow forth .
for the first time carter realized how terrific utter silence , mental and physical , may be .
the earlier moments had never failed to contain some perceptible rhythm , if only the faint , cryptical pulse of the earth dimensional extension , but now the hush of the abyss seemed to fall upon everything .
despite his intimations of body , he had no audible breath , and the glow of had grown petrifiedly fixed and unpulsating .
a potent nimbus , brighter than those which had played round the heads of the shapes , blazed frozenly over the shrouded skull of the terrible guide .
a dizziness assailed carter , and his sense of lost orientation waxed a thousandfold .
the strange lights seemed to hold the quality of the most impenetrable blacknesses heaped upon blacknesses while about the ancient ones , so close on their thrones , there hovered an air of the most stupefying remoteness .
then he felt himself wafted into immeasurable depths , with waves of perfumed warmth lapping against his face .
it was as if he floated in a torrid , sea ; a sea of drugged wine whose waves broke foaming against shores of brazen fire .
a great fear clutched him as he half saw that vast expanse of surging sea lapping against its far off coast .
but the moment of silence was broken the surgings were speaking to him in a language that was not of physical sound or articulate words .
the man of truth is beyond good and evil , intoned the voice that was not a voice .
man of truth has ridden to .
the man of truth has learned that illusion is the one reality , and that substance is the great impostor .
and now , in that rise of masonry to which his eyes had been so irresistibly drawn , there appeared the outline of a titanic arch not unlike that which he thought he had glimpsed so long ago in that cave within a cave , on the far , unreal surface of the earth .
he realized that he had been using the silver key moving it in accord with an unlearned and instinctive ritual closely akin to that which had opened the inner gate .
that sea which lapped his cheeks was , he realized , no more or less than the adamantine mass of the solid wall yielding before his spell , and the vortex of thought with which the ancient ones had aided his spell .
still guided by instinct and blind determination , he floated forward and through the ultimate gate .
chapter four randolph carter advance through the cyclopean bulk of masonry was like a dizzy precipitation through the measureless gulfs between the stars .
from a great distance he felt triumphant , godlike surges of deadly sweetness , and after that the rustling of great wings , and impressions of sound like the chirpings and murmurings of objects unknown on earth or in the solar system .
glancing backward , he saw not one gate alone but a multiplicity of gates , at some of which clamoured forms he strove not to remember .
and then , suddenly , he felt a greater terror than that which any of the forms could give a terror from which he could not flee because it was connected with himself .
even the first gateway had taken something of stability from him , leaving him uncertain about his bodily form and about his relationship to the mistily defined objects around him , but it had not disturbed his sense of unity .
he had still been randolph carter , a fixed point in the dimensional seething .
now , beyond the ultimate gateway , he realized in a moment of consuming fright that he was not one person , but many persons .
he was in many places at the same time .
on earth , on october , , a little boy named randolph carter was leaving the snake den in the hushed evening light and running down the rocky slope , and through the orchard toward his uncle christopher house in the hills beyond arkham ; yet at that same moment , which was also somehow in the earthly year of , a vague shadow not less randolph carter was sitting on a pedestal among the ancient ones in earth transdimensional extension .
here , too , was a third randolph carter , in the unknown and formless cosmic abyss beyond the ultimate gate .
and elsewhere , in a chaos of scenes whose infinite multiplicity and monstrous diversity brought him close to the brink of madness , were a limitless confusion of beings which he knew were as much himself as the local manifestation now beyond the ultimate gate .
there were carters in settings belonging to every known and suspected age of earth history , and to remoter ages of earthly entity transcending knowledge , suspicion , and credibility ; carters of forms both human and , vertebrate and invertebrate , conscious and mindless , animal and vegetable .
and more , there were carters having nothing in common with earthly life , but moving outrageously amidst backgrounds of other planets and systems and galaxies and cosmic continua ; spores of eternal life drifting from world to world , universe to universe , yet all equally himself .
some of the glimpses recalled dreams both faint and vivid , single and persistent which he had had through the long years since he first began to dream ; and a few possessed a haunting , fascinating and almost horrible familiarity which no earthly logic could explain .
faced with this realization , randolph carter reeled in the clutch of supreme horror horror such as had not been hinted even at the climax of that hideous night when two had ventured into an ancient and abhorred necropolis under a waning moon and only one had emerged .
no death , no doom , no anguish can arouse the surpassing despair which flows from a loss of identity .
merging with nothingness is peaceful oblivion ; but to be aware of existence and yet to know that one is no longer a definite being distinguished from other beings that one no longer has a self that is the nameless summit of agony and dread .
he knew that there had been a randolph carter of boston , yet could not be sure whether he the fragment or facet of an entity beyond the ultimate gate had been that one or some other .
his self had been annihilated ; and yet he if indeed there could , in view of that utter nullity of individual existence , be such a thing as he was equally aware of being in some inconceivable way a legion of selves .
it was as though his body had been suddenly transformed into one of those many limbed and effigies sculptured in indian temples , and he contemplated the aggregation in a bewildered attempt to discern which was the original and which the additions if indeed ( supremely monstrous thought ! )
there were any original as distinguished from other embodiments .
then , in the midst of these devastating reflections , carter beyond fragment was hurled from what had seemed the nadir of horror to black , clutching pits of a horror still more profound .
this time it was largely external a force of personality which at once confronted and surrounded and pervaded him , and which in addition to its local presence , seemed also to be a part of himself , and likewise to be co existent with all time and conterminous with all space .
there was no visual image , yet the sense of entity and the awful concept of combined localism and identity and infinity lent a paralyzing terror beyond anything which any had hitherto deemed capable of existing .
in the face of that awful wonder , the forgot the horror of destroyed individuality .
it was an and of limitless being and self not merely a thing of one continuum , but allied to the ultimate animating essence of existence whole unbounded sweep the last , utter sweep which has no confines and which outreaches fancy and mathematics alike .
it was perhaps that which certain secret cults of earth had whispered of as , and which has been a deity under other names ; that which the crustaceans of yuggoth worship as the , and which the vaporous brains of the spiral nebulae know by an untranslatable sign yet in a flash the realized how slight and fractional all these conceptions are .
and now the being was addressing the in prodigious waves that smote and burned and thundered a concentration of energy that blasted its recipient with unendurable violence , and that paralleled in an unearthly rhythm the curious swaying of the ancient ones , and the flickering of the monstrous lights , in that baffling region beyond the first gate .
it was as though suns and worlds and universes had converged upon one point whose very position in space they had conspired to annihilate with an impact of resistless fury .
but amidst the greater terror one lesser terror was diminished ; for the searing waves appeared somehow to isolate the carter from his infinity of duplicates to restore , as it were , a certain amount of the illusion of identity .
after a time the hearer began to translate the waves into known to him , and his sense of horror and oppression waned .
fright became pure awe , and what had seemed blasphemously abnormal seemed now only ineffably majestic .
randolph carter , it seemed to say , my manifestations on your planet extension , the ancient ones , have sent you as one who would lately have returned to small lands of dream which he had lost , yet who with greater freedom has risen to greater and nobler desires and curiosities .
you wished to sail up golden oukranos , to search out forgotten ivory cities in kied , and to reign on the opal throne of , whose fabulous towers and numberless domes rise mighty toward a single red star in a firmament alien to your earth and to all matter .
now , with the passing of two gates , you wish loftier things .
you would not flee like a child from a scene disliked to a dream beloved , but would plunge like a man into that last and inmost of secrets which lies behind all scenes and dreams .
what you wish , i have found good ; and i am ready to grant that which i have granted eleven times only to beings of your planet five times only to those you call men , or those resembling them .
i am ready to show you the ultimate mystery , to look on which is to blast a feeble spirit .
yet before you gaze full at that last and first of secrets you may still wield a free choice , and return if you will through the two gates with the veil still unrent before our eyes .
chapter five a sudden of the waves left carter in a chilling and awesome silence full of the spirit of desolation .
on every hand pressed the illimitable vastness of the void ; yet the seeker knew that the being was still there .
after a moment he thought of words whose mental substance he flung into the abyss i accept .
i will not retreat .
the waves surged forth again , and carter knew that the being had heard .
and now there poured from that limitless mind a flood of knowledge and explanation which opened new vistas to the seeker , and prepared him for such a grasp of the cosmos as he had never hoped to possess .
he was told how childish and limited is the notion of a world , and what an infinity of directions there are besides the known directions of , , .
he was shown the smallness and tinsel emptiness of the little earth gods , with their petty , human interests and connections their hatreds , rages , loves and vanities ; their craving for praise and sacrifice , and their demands for faiths contrary to reason and nature .
while most of the impressions translated themselves to carter as words there were others to which other senses gave interpretation .
perhaps with eyes and perhaps with imagination he perceived that he was in a region of dimensions beyond those conceivable to the eye and brain of man .
he saw now , in the brooding shadows of that which had been first a vortex of power and then an illimitable void , a sweep of creation that dizzied his senses .
from some inconceivable vantagepoint he looked upon prodigious forms whose multiple extensions transcended any conception of being , size and boundaries which his mind had hitherto been able to hold , despite a lifetime of cryptical study .
he began to understand dimly why there could exist at the same time the little boy randolph carter in the arkham in , the misty form on the vaguely hexagonal pillar beyond the first gate , the fragment now facing the presence in the limitless abyss , and all the other carters his fancy or perception envisaged .
then the waves increased in strength and sought to improve his understanding , reconciling him to the multiform entity of which his present fragment was an infinitesimal part .
they told him that every figure of space is but the result of the intersection by a plane of some corresponding figure of one more dimension as a square is cut from a cube , or a circle from a sphere .
the cube and sphere , of three dimensions , are thus cut from corresponding forms of four dimensions , which men know only through guesses and dreams ; and these in turn are cut from forms of five dimensions , and so on up to the dizzy and reachless heights of archetypal infinity .
the world of men and of the gods of men is merely an infinitesimal phase of an infinitesimal thing the phase of that small wholeness reached by the first gate , where dictates dreams to the ancient ones .
though men hail it as reality , and brand thoughts of its original as unreality , it is in truth the very opposite .
that which we call substance and reality is shadow and illusion , and that which we call shadow and illusion is substance and reality .
time , the waves went on , is motionless , and without beginning or end .
that it has motion and is the cause of change is an illusion .
indeed , it is itself really an illusion , for except to the narrow sight of beings in limited dimensions there are no such things as past , present and future .
men think of time only because of what they call change , yet that too is illusion .
all that was , and is , and is to be , exists simultaneously .
these revelations came with a solemnity which left carter unable to doubt .
even though they lay almost beyond his comprehension , he felt that they must be true in the light of that final cosmic reality which belies all local perspectives and narrow partial views ; and he was familiar enough with profound speculations to be free from the bondage of local and partial conceptions .
had his whole quest not been based upon a faith in the unreality of the local and partial ?
after an impressive pause the waves continued , saying that what the denizens of zones call change is merely a function of their consciousness , which views the external world from various cosmic angles .
as the shapes produced by the cutting of a cone seem to vary with the angles of cutting being circle , ellipse , parabola or hyperbola according to that angle , yet without any change in the cone itself so do the local aspects of an unchanged and endless reality seem to change with the cosmic angle of regarding .
to this variety of angles of consciousness the feeble beings of the inner worlds are slaves , since with rare exceptions they can not learn to control them .
only a few students of forbidden things have gained inklings of this control , and have thereby conquered time and change .
but the entities outside the gates command all angles , and view the myriad parts of the cosmos in terms of fragmentary perspective , or of the changeless totality beyond perspective , in accordance with their will .
as the waves paused again , carter began to comprehend , vaguely and terrifiedly , the ultimate background of that riddle of lost individuality which had at first so horrified him .
his intuition pieced together the fragments of revelation , and brought him closer and closer to a grasp of the secret .
he understood that much of the frightful revelation would have come upon him splitting up his ego amongst myriads of earthly counterparts inside the first gate , had not the magic of kept it from him in order that he might use the silver key with precision for the ultimate gate opening .
anxious for clearer knowledge , he sent out waves of thought , asking more of the exact relationship between his various facets the fragment now beyond the ultimate gate , the fragment still on the pedestal beyond the first gate , the boy of , the man of , the various ancestral beings who had formed his heritage and the bulwark of his ego , amid the nameless denizens of the other eons and other worlds which that first hideous flash ultimate perception had identified with him .
slowly the waves of the being surged out in reply , trying to make plain what was almost beyond the reach of an earthly mind .
all descended lines of beings of the finite dimensions , continued the waves , and all stages of growth in each one of these beings , are merely manifestations of one archetypal and eternal being in the space outside dimensions .
each local being son , father , grandfather , and so on and each stage of individual being infant , child , boy , man is merely one of the infinite phases of that same archetypal and eternal being , caused by a variation in the angle of the which cuts it .
randolph carter at all ages ; randolph carter and all his ancestors , both human and , terrestrial and ; all these were only phases of one ultimate , eternal carter outside space and time phantom projections differentiated only by the angle at which the plane of consciousness happened to cut the eternal archetype in each case .
a slight change of angle could turn the student of today into the child of yesterday ; could turn randolph carter into that wizard , edmund carter who fled from salem to the hills behind arkham in , or that pickman carter who in the year would use strange means in repelling the mongol hordes from australia ; could turn a human carter into one of those earlier entities which had dwelt in primal hyperborea and worshipped black , plastic tsathoggua after flying down from kythamil , the double planet that once revolved around arcturus ; could turn a terrestrial carter to a remotely ancestral and doubtfully shaped dweller on kythamil itself , or a still remoter creature of stronti , or a gaseous consciousness in an older continuum , or a vegetable brain of the future on a dark , radioactive comet of inconceivable orbit so on , in endless cosmic cycle .
the archetype , throbbed the waves , are the people of the ultimate abyss formless , ineffable , and guessed at only by rare dreamers on the worlds .
chief among such was this informing being itself which indeed was carter own archetype .
the gutless zeal of carter and all his forebears for forbidden cosmic secrets was a natural result of derivation from the supreme archetype .
on every world all great wizards , all great thinkers , all great artists , are facets of it .
almost stunned with awe , and with a kind of terrifying delight , randolph carter consciousness did homage to that transcendent entity from which it was derived .
as the waves paused again he pondered in the mighty silence , thinking of strange tributes , stranger questions , and still stranger requests .
curious concepts flowed conflictingly through a brain dazed with unaccustomed vistas and unforeseen disclosures .
it occurred to him that , if these disclosures were literally true , he might bodily visit all those infinitely distant ages and parts of the universe which he had hitherto known only in dreams , could he but command the magic to change the angle of his .
and did not the silver key supply that magic ?
had it not first changed him from a man in to a boy in , and then to something quite outside time ?
oddly , despite his present apparent absence of body ; he knew that the key was still with him .
while the silence still lasted , randolph carter radiated forth the thoughts and questions which assailed him .
he knew that in this ultimate abyss he was equidistant from every facet of his archetype human or , terrestrial or , galactic or ; and his curiosity regarding the other phases of his being especially those phases which were farthest from an earthly in time and space , or which had most persistently haunted his dreams throughout life was at fever heat he felt that his archetypal entity could at will send him bodily to any of these phases of bygone and distant life by changing his and despite the marvels he had undergone he burned for the further marvel of walking in the flesh through those grotesque and incredible scenes which visions of the night had fragmentarily brought him .
without definite intention he was asking the presence for access to a dim , fantastic world whose five suns , alien constellations , dizzily black crags , clawed , denizens , bizarre metal towers , unexplained tunnels , and cryptical floating cylinders had intruded again and again upon his slumbers .
that world , he felt vaguely , was in all the conceivable cosmos the one most freely in touch with others ; and he longed to explore the vistas whose beginnings he had glimpsed , and to embark through space to those still remoter worlds with which the clawed , snouted denizens trafficked .
there was no time for fear .
as at all crises of his strange life , sheer cosmic curiosity triumphed over everything else .
when the waves resumed their awesome pulsing , carter knew that his terrible request was granted .
the being was telling him of the nighted gulfs through which he would have to pass of the unknown quintuple star in an unsuspected galaxy around which the alien world revolved , and of the burrowing inner horrors against which the clawed , snouted race of that world perpetually fought .
it told him , too , of how the angle of his personal , and the angle of his regarding the elements of the sought for world , would have to be tilted simultaneously in order to restore to that world the which had dwelt there .
the presence wanted him to be sure of his symbols if he wished ever to return from the remote and alien world he had chosen , and he radiated back an impatient affirmation ; confident that the silver key , which he felt was with him and which he knew had tilted both world and personal planes in throwing him back to , contained those symbols which were meant .
and now the being , grasping his impatience signified its readiness to accomplish the monstrous precipitation .
the waves abruptly ceased , and there supervened a momentary stillness tense with nameless and dreadful expectancy .
then , without warning , came a whirring and drumming that swelled to a terrific thundering .
once again carter felt himself the focal point of an intense concentration of energy which smote and hammered and seared unbearably in the rhythm of outer space , and which he could not classify as either the blasting heat of a blazing star , or the cold of the ultimate abyss .
bands and rays of colour utterly foreign to any spectrum of our universe played and wove and interlaced before him , and he was conscious of a frightful velocity of motion .
he caught one fleeting glimpse of a figure sitting alone upon a cloudy throne more hexagonal than otherwise chapter six as the hindoo paused in his story he saw that de marigny and phillips were watching him absorbedly .
aspinwall pretended to ignore the narrative and kept his eyes ostentatiously on the papers before him .
the ticking of the clock took on a new and portentous meaning , while the fumes from the choked , neglected tripods wove themselves into fantastic and inexplicable shapes , and formed disturbing combinations with the grotesque figures of the tapestries .
the old negro who had tended them was gone perhaps some growing tension had frightened him out of the house .
an almost apologetic hesitancy hampered the speaker as he resumed in his oddly labored yet idiomatic voice .
you have found these things of the abyss hard to believe , he said , but you will find the tangible and material things ahead still barer .
that is the way of our minds .
marvels are doubly incredible when brought into three dimensions from the vague regions of possible dream .
i shall not try to tell you much that would be another and very different story .
i will tell only what you absolutely have to know .
carter , after that final vortex of alien and polychromatic rhythm , had found himself in what for a moment he thought was his old insistent dream .
he was , as many a night before , walking amidst throngs of clawed , snouted beings through the streets of a labyrinth of inexplicably fashioned metal under a plate of diverse solar colour ; and as he looked down he saw that his body was like those of the others rugose , partly squamous , and curiously articulated in a fashion mainly yet not without a caricaturish resemblance to the human outline .
the silver key was still in his grasp , though held by a claw .
in another moment the vanished , and he felt rather as one just awakened from a dream .
the ultimate abyss the being the entity of absurd , outlandish race called randolph carter on a world of the future not yet born some of these things were parts of the persistent recurrent dreams of the wizard zkauba on the planet yaddith .
they were too persistent they interfered with his duties in weaving spells to keep the frightful dholes in their burrows , and became mixed up with his recollections of the myriad real worlds he had visited in light beam envelopes .
and now they had become as never before .
this heavy , material silver key in his right upper claw , exact image of one he had dreamt about meant no good .
he must rest and reflect , and consult the tablets of nhing for advice on what to do .
climbing a metal wall in a lane off the main concourse , he entered his apartment and approached the rack of tablets .
seven later zkauba squatted on his prism in awe and half despair , for the truth had opened up a new and conflicting set of memories .
nevermore could he know the peace of being one entity .
for all time and space he was two zkauba the wizard of yaddith , disgusted with the thought of the repellent carter that he was to be and had been , and randolph carter , of boston on the earth , shivering with fright at the clawed , mantel thing which he had once been , and had become again .
the time units spent on yaddith , croaked the swami whose laboured voice was beginning to show signs of fatigue made a tale in themselves which could not be related in brief compass .
there were trips to stronti and mthura and kath , and other worlds in the galaxies accessible to the envelopes of the creatures of yaddith , and trips back and forth through eons of time with the aid of the silver key and various other symbols known to yaddith wizards .
there were hideous struggles with the bleached viscous dholes in the primal tunnels that honeycombed the planet .
there were awed sessions in libraries amongst the massed lore of ten thousand worlds living and dead .
there were tense conferences with other minds of yaddith , including that of the buo .
zkauba told no one of what had befallen his personality , but when the randolph carter facet was uppermost he would study furiously every possible means of returning to the earth and to human form , and would desperately practice human speech with the alien so ill adapted to it .
the had soon learned with horror that the silver key was unable to effect his return to human form .
it was , as he deduced too late from things he remembered , things he dreamed , and things he inferred from the lore of yaddith , a product of hyperborea on earth ; with power over the personal of human beings alone .
it could , however , change the planetary angle and send the user at will through time in an unchanged body .
there had been an added spell which gave it limitless powers it otherwise lacked ; but this , too , was a human discovery peculiar to a spatially unreachable region , and not to be duplicated by the wizards of yaddith .
it had been written on the undecipherable parchment in the hideously carven box with the silver key , and carter bitterly lamented that he had left it behind .
the now inaccessible being of the abyss had warned him to be sure of his symbols , and had doubtless thought he lacked nothing .
as time wore on he strove harder and harder to utilize the monstrous lore of yaddith in finding a way back to the abyss and the omnipotent entity .
with his new knowledge he could have done much toward reading the cryptic parchment ; but that power , under present conditions , was merely ironic .
there were times , however , when the was uppermost and when he strove to erase the conflicting which troubled him .
thus long spaces of time wore on ages longer than the brain of man could grasp , since the beings of yaddith die only after prolonged cycles .
after many hundreds of revolutions the seemed to gain on the , and would spend vast periods calculating the distance of yaddith in space and time from the human earth that was to be .
the figures were staggering eons of beyond counting but the immemorial lore of yaddith fitted carter to grasp such things .
he cultivated the power of dreaming himself momentarily earthward , and learned many things about our planet that he had never known before .
but he could not dream the needed formula on the missing parchment .
then at last he conceived a wild plan of escape from yaddith which began when he found a drug that would keep his always dormant , yet with out dissolution of the knowledge and memories of zkauba .
he thought that his calculations would let him perform a voyage with a envelope such as no being of yaddith had ever performed a bodily voyage through nameless eons and across incredible galactic reaches to the solar system and the earth itself .
once on earth , though in the body of a clawed , snouted thing , he might be able somehow to find and finish deciphering the strangely hieroglyphed parchment he had left in the car at arkham ; and with its aid and the key resume his normal terrestrial semblance .
he was not blind to the perils of the attempt .
he knew that when he had brought the to the right ( a thing impossible to do while hurtling through space ) , yaddith would be a dead world dominated by triumphant dholes , and that his escape in the envelope would be a matter of grave doubt .
likewise was he aware of how he must achieve suspended animation , in the manner of an adept , to endure the flight through fathomless abysses .
he knew , too , that assuming his voyage succeeded he must immunize himself to the bacterial and other earthly conditions hostile to a body from yaddith .
furthermore , he must provide a way of feigning human shape on earth until he might recover and decipher the parchment and resume that shape in truth .
otherwise he would probably be discovered and destroyed by the people in horror as a thing that should not be .
and there must be some gold luckily obtainable on yaddith to tide him over that period of quest .
slowly carter plans went forward .
he prepared a envelope of abnormal toughness , able to stand both the prodigious time transition and the unexampled flight through space .
he tested all his calculations , and sent forth his earthward dreams again and again , bringing them as close as possible to .
he practiced suspended animation with marvelous success .
he discovered just the bacterial agent he needed , and worked out the varying to which he must become used .
he artfully fashioned a waxen mask and loose costume enabling him to pass among men as a human being of a sort , and devised a doubly potent spell with which to hold back the dholes at the moment of his starting from the dead , black yaddith of the inconceivable future .
he took care , too , to assemble a large supply of the drugs unobtainable on earth which would keep his in abeyance till he might shed the yaddith body , nor did he neglect a small store of gold for earthly use .
the was a time of doubt and apprehension .
carter climbed up to his , on the pretext of sailing for the triple star nython , and crawled into the sheath of shining metal .
he had just room to perform the ritual of the silver key , and as he did so he slowly started the levitation of his envelope .
there was an appalling seething and darkening of the day , and hideous racking of pain .
the cosmos seemed to reel irresponsibly , and the other constellations danced in a black sky .
all at once carter felt a new equilibrium .
the cold of interstellar gulfs gnawed at the outside of his envelope , and he could see that he floated free in space the metal building from which he had started having decayed years before .
below him the ground was festering with gigantic dholes ; and even as he looked , one reared up several hundred feet and leveled a bleached , viscous end at him .
but his spells were effective , and in another moment he was falling away from yaddith , unharmed .
chapter seven in that bizarre room in new orleans , from which the old black servant had instinctively fled , the odd voice of swami chandraputra grew hoarser still .
gentlemen , he continued , i will not ask you to believe these things until i have shown you special proof .
accept it , then , as a myth , when i tell you of the thousands of thousands of years of time , and uncounted billions of miles that randolph carter hurtled through space as a nameless , alien entity in a thin envelope of metal .
he timed his period of suspended animation with utmost care , planning to have it end only a few years before the time of landing on the earth in or near .
he will never forget that awakening .
remember , gentlemen , that before that sleep he had lived consciously for thousands of terrestrial years amidst the alien and horrible wonders of yaddith .
there was a hideous gnawing of cold , a cessation of menacing dreams , and a glance through the of the envelope .
stars , clusters , nebulae , on every hand and at last their outline bore some kinship to the constellations of earth that he knew .
some day his descent into the solar system may be told .
he saw kynath and yuggoth on the rim , passed close to neptune and glimpsed the hellish white fungi that spot it , learned an untellable secret from the mists of jupiter , and saw the horror on one of the satellites , and gazed at the cyclopean ruins that sprawl over mars ' ruddy disc .
when the earth drew near he saw it as a thin crescent which swelled alarmingly in size .
he slackened speed , though his sensations of homecoming made him wish to lose not a moment .
i will not try to tell you of these sensations as i learned them from carter .
well , toward the last carter hovered about in the earth upper air waiting till daylight came over the western hemisphere .
he wanted to land where he had left near the snake den in the hills behind arkham .
if any of you have been away from home long and i know one of you has i leave it to you how the sight of new england rolling hills and great elms and gnarled orchards and ancient stone walls must have affected him .
he came down at dawn in the lower meadow of the old carter place , and was thankful for the silence and solitude .
it was autumn , as when he had left , and the smell of the hills was balm to his soul .
he managed to drag the metal envelope up the slope of the timber lot into the snake den , though it would not go through the fissure to the inner cave .
it was there also that he covered his alien body with the human clothing and waxen mask which would be necessary .
he kept the envelope here for over a year , till certain circumstances made a new necessary .
he walked to arkham incidentally practicing the management of his body in human posture and against terrestrial gravity and had his gold changed to money at a bank .
he also made some inquiries posing as a foreigner ignorant of much english and found that the year was , only two years after the goal he had aimed at .
of course , his position was horrible .
unable to assert his identity , forced to live on guard every moment , with certain difficulties regarding food , and with a need to conserve the alien drug which kept his dormant , he felt that he must act as quickly as possible .
going to boston and taking a room in the decaying west end , where he could live cheaply and inconspicuously , he at once established inquiries concerning randolph carter estate and effects .
it was then that he learned how anxious aspinwall , here , was to have the estate divided , and how valiantly de marigny and phillips strove to keep it intact .
the hindoo bowed , though no expression crossed his dark , tranquil , and thickly bearded face .
indirectly , he continued , carter secured a good copy of the missing parchment and began working on its deciphering .
i am glad to say that i was able to help in all this for he appealed to me quite early , and through me came in touch with other mystics throughout the world .
i went to live with him in boston a wretched place in chambers street .
as for the parchment i am pleased to help de marigny in his perplexity .
to him let me say that the language of those hieroglyphics is not naacal , but , which was brought to earth by the spawn of cthulhu countless ages ago .
it is , of coarse , a translation there was an hyperborean original millions of years earlier in the primal tongue of .
there was more to decipher than carter had looked for , but at no time did he give up hope .
early this year he made great strides through a book he imported from nepal , and there is no question but that he will win before long .
unfortunately , however , one handicap has developed the exhaustion of the alien drug which keeps the dormant .
this is not , however , as great a calamity as was feared .
carter personality is gaining in the body , and when zkauba comes uppermost for shorter and shorter periods , and now only when evoked by some unusual excitement he is generally too dazed to undo any of carter work .
he can not find the metal envelope that would take him back to yaddith , for although he almost did , once , carter hid it anew at a time when the was wholly latent .
all the harm he has done is to frighten a few people and create certain nightmare rumors among the poles and lithuanians of boston west end .
so far , he had never injured the careful disguise prepared by the , though he sometimes throws it off so that parts have to be replaced .
i have seen what lies beneath and it is not good to see .
a month ago carter saw the advertisement of this meeting , and knew that he must act quickly to save his estate .
he could not wait to decipher the parchment and resume his human form .
consequently he deputed me to act for him .
gentlemen , i say to you that randolph carter is not dead ; that he is temporarily in an anomalous condition , but that within two or three months at the outside he will be able to appear in proper form and demand the custody of his estate .
i am prepared to offer proof if necessary .
therefore i beg that you will adjourn this meeting for an indefinite period .
chapter eight de marigny and phillips stared at the hindoo as if hypnotized , while aspinwall emitted a series of snorts and bellows .
the old attorney disgust had by now surged into open rage and he pounded the table with an apoplectically veined fist .
when he spoke , it was in a kind of bark .
how long is this foolery to be borne ?
i listened an hour to this madman this faker and now he has the damned effrontery to say randolph carter is alive to ask us to postpone the settlement for no good reason !
why do you throw the scoundrel out , de marigny ?
do you mean to make us all the butts of a charlatan or idiot ?
de marigny quietly raised his hand and spoke softly .
let us think slowly and dearly .
this has been a very singular tale , and there are things in it which i , as a mystic not altogether ignorant , recognize as far from impossible .
furthermore since i have received letters from the swami which tally with his account .
as he paused , old phillips ventured a word .
swami chandraputra spoke of proofs .
i , too , recognize much that is significant in this story , and i have myself had many oddly corroborative letters from the swami during the last two years ; but some of these statements are very extreme .
is there not something tangible which can be shown ?
at last the swami replied , slowly and hoarsely , and drawing an object from the pocket of his loose coat as he spoke .
while none of you here has ever seen the silver key itself , de marigny and phillips have seen photographs of it .
does this look familiar to you ?
he fumblingly laid on the table , with his large , hand , a heavy key of tarnished silver nearly five inches long , of unknown and utterly exotic workmanship , and covered from end to end with hieroglyphs of the most bizarre description .
de marigny and phillips gasped .
that it !
cried de marigny .
the camera does lie .
i could be mistaken !
but aspinwall had already launched a reply .
fools !
what does it prove ?
if that really the key that belonged to my cousin , it up to this foreigner this damned nigger to explain how he got it !
randolph carter vanished with the key four years ago .
how do we know he was robbed and murdered ?
he was half crazy himself , and in touch with still crazier people .
look here , you nigger where did you get that key ?
did you kill randolph carter ?
the swami features , abnormally placid , did not change ; but the remote , irisless black eyes behind them blazed dangerously .
he spoke with great difficulty .
please control yourself , aspinwall .
there is another form of proof that i could give , but its effect upon everybody would not be pleasant .
let us be reasonable .
here are some papers obviously written since , and in the unmistakable style of randolph carter .
he clumsily drew a long envelope from inside his loose coat and handed it to the sputtering attorney as de marigny and phillips watched with chaotic thoughts and a dawning feeling of supernal wonder .
of course the handwriting is almost illegible but remember that randolph carter now has no hands well adapted to forming human script .
aspinwall looked through the papers hurriedly , and was visibly perplexed , but he did not change his demeanor .
the room was tense with excitement and nameless dread and the alien rhythm of the coffin shaped clock had an utterly diabolic sound to de marigny and phillips , though the lawyer seemed affected not at all .
aspinwall spoke again .
these look like clever forgeries .
if they are , they may mean that randolph carter has been brought under the control of people with no good purpose .
there only one thing to do have this faker arrested .
de marigny , will you telephone for the police ?
let us wait , answered their host .
i do not think this case calls for the police .
i have a certain idea .
aspinwall , this gentleman is a mystic of real attainments .
he says he is in the confidence of randolph carter .
will it satisfy you if he can answer certain questions which could be answered only by one in such confidence ?
i know carter , and can ask such questions .
let me get a book which i think will make a good test .
he turned toward the door to the library , phillips dazedly following in a kind of automatic way .
aspinwall remained where he was , studying closely the hindoo who confronted him with abnormally impassive face .
suddenly , as chandraputra clumsily restored the silver key to his pocket the lawyer emitted a guttural shout .
hey , by heaven i got it !
this rascal is in disguise .
i do believe he an east indian at all .
that face it is a face , but a mask !
i guess his story put that into my head , but it true .
it never moves , and that turban and beard hide the edges .
this fellow a common crook !
he is even a foreigner i been watching his language .
he a yankee of some sort .
and look at those mittens he knows his fingerprints could be spotted .
damn you , i pull that thing off stop !
the hoarse , oddly alien voice of the swami held a tone beyond all mere earthly fright i told you there was another form of proof which i could give if necessary , and i warned you not to provoke me to it .
this old meddler is right ; i not really an east indian .
this face is a mask , and what it covers is not human .
you others have guessed i felt that minutes ago .
it would be pleasant if i took that mask off let it alone .
ernest , i may as well tell you that i am randolph carter .
no one moved .
aspinwall snorted and made vague motions .
de marigny and phillips , across the room , watched the workings of the red face and studied the back of the turbaned figure that confronted him .
the clock abnormal ticking was hideous and the tripod fumes and swaying arras danced a dance of death .
the lawyer broke the silence .
no you do , you crook you ca scare me !
you reasons of your own for not wanting that mask off .
maybe we know who you are .
off with it as he reached forward , the swami seized his hand with one of his own clumsily mittened members , evoking a curious cry of mixed pain and surprise .
de marigny started toward the two , but paused confused as the shout of protest changed to a wholly inexplicable rattling and buzzing sound .
aspinwall red face was furious , and with his free hand he made another lunge at his opponent bushy beard .
this time he succeeded in getting a hold , and at his frantic tug the whole waxen visage came loose from the turban and clung to the lawyer apoplectic fist .
as it did so , aspinwall uttered a frightful gurgling cry , and phillips and de marigny saw his face convulsed with a wilder , deep and more hideous epilepsy of stark panic than ever they had seen on human countenance before .
the had meanwhile released his other hand and was standing as if dazed , making buzzing noises of a most abnormal quality .
then the turbaned figure slumped oddly into a posture scarcely human , and began a curious , fascinated sort of shuffle toward the clock that ticked out its cosmic and abnormal rhythm .
his now uncovered face was turned away , and de marigny and phillips could not see what the lawyer act had disclosed .
then their attention was turned to aspinwall , who was sinking ponderously to the floor .
the spell was broken but when they reached the old man he was dead .
turning quickly to the shuffling swami receding back , de marigny saw one of the great white mittens drop listlessly off a dangling arm .
the fumes of the olibanum were thick , and all that could be glimpsed of the revealed hand was something long and black before the creole could reach the retreating figure , old phillips laid a hand on his shoulder .
do !
he whispered , we do know what we up against .
that other facet , you know zkauba , the wizard of yaddith the turbaned figure had now reached the abnormal clock , and the watchers saw though the dense fumes a blurred black claw fumbling with the tall , hieroglyphed door .
the fumbling made a queer , clicking sound .
then the figure entered the case and pulled the door shut after it .
de marigny could no longer be restrained , but when he reached and opened the clock it was empty .
the abnormal ticking went on , beating out the dark , cosmic rhythm which underlies all mystical .
on the floor the great white mitten , and the dead man with a bearded mask clutched in his hand , had nothing further to reveal .
a year passed , and nothing has been heard of randolph carter .
his estate is still unsettled .
the boston address from which one swami chandraputra sent inquiries to various mystics in was indeed tenanted by a strange hindoo , but he left shortly before the date of the new orleans conference and has never been seen since .
he was said to be dark , expressionless , and bearded , and his landlord thinks the swarthy mask which was duly exhibited looked very much like him .
he was never , however , suspected of any connection with the nightmare apparitions whispered of by local slavs .
the hills behind arkham were searched for the metal envelope , but nothing of the sort was ever found .
however , a clerk in arkham first national bank does recall a queer turbaned man who cashed an odd bit of gold bullion in october , .
de marigny and phillips scarcely know what to make of the business .
after all , what was proved ?
there was a story .
there was a key which might have been forged from one of the pictures carter had freely distributed in .
there were papers all indecisive .
there was a masked stranger , but who now living saw behind the mask ?
amidst the strain and the olibanum fumes that act of vanishing in the clock might easily have been a dual hallucination .
hindoos know much of hypnotism .
reason proclaims the swami a criminal with designs on randolph carter estate .
but the autopsy said that aspinwall had died of shock .
was it rage alone which caused it ?
and some things in that story
in a vast room hung with strangely figured arras and filled with olibanum fumes , etienne laurent de marigny often sits listening with vague sensations to the abnormal rhythm of that hieroglyphed , clock .
it was in the spectral summer when the moon shone down on the old garden where i wandered ; the spectral summer of narcotic flowers and humid seas of foliage that bring wild and dreams .
and as i walked by the shallow crystal stream i saw unwonted ripples tipped with yellow light , as if those placid waters were drawn on in resistless currents to strange oceans that are not in the world .
silent and sparkling , bright and baleful , those waters hurried i knew not whither ; whilst from the embowered banks white fluttered one by one in the opiate and dropped despairingly into the stream , swirling away horribly under the arched , carven bridge , and staring back with the sinister resignation of calm , dead faces .
and as i ran along the shore , crushing sleeping flowers with heedless feet and maddened ever by the fear of unknown things and the lure of the dead faces , i saw that the garden had no end under that moon ; for where by day the walls were , there stretched now only new vistas of trees and paths , flowers and shrubs , stone idols and pagodas , and bendings of the stream past grassy banks and under grotesque bridges of marble .
and the lips of the dead whispered sadly , and bade me follow , nor did i cease my steps till the stream became a river , and joined amidst marshes of swaying reeds and beaches of gleaming sand the shore of a vast and nameless sea .
upon that sea the hateful moon shone , and over its unvocal waves weird perfumes breeded .
and as i saw therein the vanish , i longed for nets that i might capture them and learn from them the secrets which the moon had brought upon the night .
but when that moon went over to the west and the still tide ebbed from the sullen shore , i saw in that light old spires that the waves almost uncovered , and white columns gay with festoons of green seaweed .
and knowing that to this sunken place all the dead had come , i trembled and did not wish again to speak with the .
yet when i saw afar out in the sea a black condor descend from the sky to seek rest on a vast reef , i would fain have questioned him , and asked him of those whom i had known when they were alive .
this i would have asked him had he not been so far away , but he was very far , and could not be seen at all when he drew nigh that gigantic reef .
so i watched the tide go out under that sinking moon , and saw gleaming the spires , the towers , and the roofs of that dead , dripping city .
and as i watched , my nostrils tried to close against the perfume conquering stench of the world dead ; for truly , in this unplaced and forgotten spot had all the flesh of the churchyards gathered for puffy to gnaw and glut upon .
over these horrors the evil moon now hung very low , but the puffy worms of the sea need no moon to feed by .
and as i watched the ripples that told of the writhing of worms beneath , i felt a new chill from afar out whither the condor had flown , as if my flesh had caught a horror before my eyes had seen it .
nor had my flesh trembled without cause , for when i raised my eyes i saw that the waters had ebbed very low , shewing much of the vast reef whose rim i had seen before .
and when i saw that the reef was but the black basalt crown of a shocking eikon whose monstrous forehead now shown in the dim moonlight and whose vile hooves must paw the hellish ooze miles below , i shrieked and shrieked lest the hidden face rise above the waters , and lest the hidden eyes look at me after the slinking away of that leering and treacherous yellow moon .
and to escape this relentless thing i plunged gladly and unhesitantly into the stinking shallows where amidst weedy walls and sunken streets fat feast upon the world dead .
into the north window of my chamber glows the pole star with uncanny light .
all through the long hellish hours of blackness it shines there .
and in the autumn of the year , when the winds from the north curse and whine , and the trees of the swamp mutter things to one another in the small hours of the morning under the horned waning moon , i sit by the casement and watch that star .
down from the heights reels the glittering cassiopeia as the hours wear on , while charles ' wain lumbers up from behind the swamp trees that sway in the night wind .
just before dawn arcturus winks ruddily from above the cemetery on the low hillock , and coma berenices shimmers weirdly afar off in the mysterious east ; but still the pole star leers down from the same place in the black vault , winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some strange message , yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey .
sometimes , when it is cloudy , i can sleep .
well do i remember the night of the great aurora , when over the swamp played the shocking corruscations of the daemon light .
after the beam came clouds , and then i slept .
and it was under a horned waning moon that i saw the city for the first time .
still and somnolent did it lie , on a strange plateau in a hollow between strange peaks .
of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers , its columns , domes , and pavements .
in the marble streets were marble pillars , the upper parts of which were carven into the images of grave bearded men .
the air was warm and stirred not .
and overhead , scarce ten degrees from the zenith , glowed that watching pole star .
long did i gaze on the city , but the day came not .
when the red aldebaran , which blinked low in the sky but never set , had crawled a quarter of the way around the horizon , i saw light and motion in the houses and the streets .
forms strangely robed , but at once noble and familiar , walked abroad and under the horned waning moon men talked wisdom in a tongue which i understood , though it was unlike any language which i had ever known .
and when the red aldebaran had crawled more than around the horizon , there were again darkness and silence .
when i awaked , i was not as i had been .
upon my memory was graven the vision of the city , and within my soul had arisen another and vaguer recollection , of whose nature i was not then certain .
thereafter , on the cloudy nights when i could not sleep , i saw the city often ; sometimes under the hot , yellow rays of a sun which did not set , but which wheeled low in the horizon .
and on the clear nights the pole star leered as never before .
gradually i came to wonder what might be my place in that city on the strange plateau betwixt strange peaks .
at first content to view the scene as an uncorporeal presence , i now desired to define my relation to it , and to speak my mind amongst the grave men who conversed each day in the public squares .
i said to myself , this is no dream , for by what means can i prove the greater reality of that other life in the house of stone and brick south of the sinister swamp and the cemetery on the low hillock , where the pole star peeps into my north window each night ?
one night as i listened to the discourses in the large square containing many statues , i felt a change ; and perceived that i had at last a bodily form .
nor was i a stranger in the streets of olathoe , which lies on the plateau of sarkia , betwixt the peaks of noton and kadiphonek .
it was my friend alos who spoke , and his speech was one that pleased my soul , for it was the speech of a true man and patriot .
that night had the news come of daikos ' fall , and of the advance of the inutos ; squat , hellish yellow fiends who five years ago had appeared out of the unknown west to ravage the confines of our kingdom , and to besiege many of our towns .
having taken the fortified places at the foot of the mountains , their way now lay open to the plateau , unless every citizen could resist with the strength of ten men .
for the squat creatures were mighty in the arts of war , and knew not the scruples of honour which held back our tall , men of lomar from ruthless conquest .
alos , my friend , was commander of all the forces on the plateau , and in him lay the last hope of our country .
on this occasion he spoke of the perils to be faced and exhorted the men of olathoe , bravest of the lomarians , to sustain the traditions of their ancestors , who when forced to move southward from zobna before the advance of the great ice sheet ( even as our descendents must some day flee from the land of lomar ) valiantly and victoriously swept aside the hairy , , cannibal gnophkehs that stood in their way .
to me alos denied the warriors part , for i was feeble and given to strange faintings when subjected to stress and hardships .
but my eyes were the keenest in the city , despite the long hours i gave each day to the study of the pnakotic manuscripts and the wisdom of the zobnarian fathers ; so my friend , desiring not to doom me to inaction , rewarded me with that duty which was second to nothing in importance .
to the watchtower of thapnen he sent me , there to serve as the eyes of our army .
should the inutos attempt to gain the citadel by the narrow pass behind the peak noton and thereby surprise the garrison , i was to give the signal of fire which would warn the waiting soldiers and save the town from immediate disaster .
alone i mounted the tower , for every man of stout body was needed in the passes below .
my brain was sore dazed with excitement and fatigue , for i had not slept in many days ; yet was my purpose firm , for i loved my native land of lomar , and the marble city olathoe that lies betwixt the peaks noton and kadiphonek .
but as i stood in the tower topmost chamber , i beheld the horned waning moon , red and sinister , quivering through the vapours that hovered over the distant valley of banof .
and through an opening in the roof glittered the pale pole star , fluttering as if alive , and leering like a fiend and tempter .
methought its spirit whispered evil counsel , soothing me to traitorous somnolence with a damnable rhythmical promise which it repeated over and over slumber , watcher , till the spheres .
six and twenty thousand years have revolv , and i return to the spot where now i burn .
other stars anon shall rise to the axis of the skies ; stars that soothe and stars that bless with a sweet forgetfulness only when my round is shall the past disturb thy door .
vainly did i struggle with my drowsiness , seeking to connect these strange words with some lore of the skies which i had learnt from the pnakotic manuscripts .
my head , heavy and reeling , drooped to my breast , and when next i looked up it was in a dream , with the pole star grinning at me through a window from over the horrible and swaying trees of a dream swamp .
and i am still dreaming .
in my shame and despair i sometimes scream frantically , begging the around me to waken me ere the inutos steal up the pass behind the peak noton and take the citadel by surprise ; but these creatures are daemons , for they laugh at me and tell me i am not dreaming .
they mock me whilst i sleep , and whilst the squat yellow foe may be creeping silently upon us .
i have failed in my duties and betrayed the marble city of olathoe ; i have proven false to alos , my friend and commander .
but still these shadows of my dreams deride me .
they say there is no land of lomar , save in my nocturnal imaginings that in these realms where the pole star shines high , and red aldebaran crawls low around the horizon , there has been naught save ice and snow for thousands of years of years , and never a man save squat , yellow creatures , blighted by the cold , called esquimaux .
and as i writhe in my guilty agony , frantic to save the city whose peril every moment grows , and vainly striving to shake off this unnatural dream of a house of stone and brick south of a sinister swamp and a cemetery on a low hillock , the pole star , evil and monstrous , leers down from the black vault , winking hideously like an insane watching eye which strives to convey some message , yet recalls nothing save that it once had a message to convey .
from a letter written to melmoth ( donald wandrei ) on thursday , november , it was a flaming sunset or late afternoon in the tiny provincial town of pompelo , at the foot of the pyrenees in hispania citerior .
the year must have been in the late republic , for the province was still ruled by a senatorial proconsul instead of a prætorian legate of augustus , and the day was the first before the kalends of november .
the hills rose scarlet and gold to the north of the little town , and the westering sun shone ruddily and mystically on the crude new stone and plaster buildings of the dusty forum and the wooden walls of the circus some distance to the east .
groups of citizens roman colonists and romanised natives , together with obvious hybrids of the two strains , alike clad in cheap woollen togas and sprinklings of helmeted legionaries and , tribesmen of the circumambient vascones all thronged the few paved streets and forum ; moved by some vague and uneasiness .
i myself had just alighted from a litter , which the illyrian bearers seemed to have brought in some haste from calagurris , across the iberus to the southward .
it appeared that i was a provincial quæstor named cælius rufus , and that i had been summoned by the proconsul , scribonius libo , who had come from tarraco some days before .
the soldiers were the fifth cohort of the xiith legion , under the military tribune sex .
asellius ; and the legatus of the whole region , cn .
balbutius , had also come from calagurris , where the permanent station was .
the cause of the conference was a horror that brooded on the hills .
all the townsfolk were frightened , and had begged the presence of a cohort from calagurris .
it was the terrible season of the autumn , and the wild people in the mountains were preparing for the frightful ceremonies which only rumour told of in the towns .
they were the very old folk who dwelt higher up in the hills and spoke a choppy language which the vascones could not understand .
one seldom saw them ; but a few times a year they sent down little yellow , messengers ( who looked like scythians ) to trade with the merchants by means of gestures , and every spring and autumn they held the infamous rites on the peaks , their howlings and throwing terror into the villages .
always the same the night before the kalends of maius and the night before the kalends of november .
townsfolk would disappear just before these nights , and would never be heard of again .
and there were whispers that the native shepherds and farmers were not toward the very old folk that more than one thatched hut was vacant before midnight on the two hideous sabbaths .
this year the horror was very great , for the people knew that the wrath of the very old folk was upon pompelo .
three months previously five of the little traders had come down from the hills , and in a market brawl three of them had been killed .
the remaining two had gone back wordlessly to their mountains and this autumn not a single villager had disappeared .
there was menace in this immunity .
it was not like the very old folk to spare their victims at the sabbath .
it was too good to be normal , and the villagers were afraid .
for many nights there had been a hollow drumming on the hills , and at last the ædile tib .
annæus stilpo ( half native in blood ) had sent to balbutius at calagurris for a cohort to stamp out the sabbath on the terrible night .
balbutius had carelessly refused , on the ground that the villagers ' fears were empty , and that the loathsome rites of hill folk were of no concern to the roman people unless our own citizens were menaced .
i , however , who seemed to be a close friend of balbutius , had disagreed with him ; averring that i had studied deeply in the black forbidden lore , and that i believed the very old folk capable of visiting almost any nameless doom upon the town , which after all was a roman settlement and contained a great number of our citizens .
the complaining ædile own mother helvia was a pure roman , the daughter of helvius cinna , who had come over with scipio army .
accordingly i had sent a slave a nimble little greek called antipater to the proconsul with letters , and scribonius had heeded my plea and ordered balbutius to send his fifth cohort , under asellius , to pompelo ; entering the hills at dusk on the eve of november kalends and stamping out whatever nameless orgies he might find bringing such prisoners as he might take to tarraco for the next proprætor court .
balbutius , however , had protested , so that more correspondence had ensued .
i had written so much to the proconsul that he had become gravely interested , and had resolved to make a personal inquiry into the horror .
he had at length proceeded to pompelo with his lictors and attendants ; there hearing enough rumours to be greatly impressed and disturbed , and standing firmly by his order for the sabbath extirpation .
desirous of conferring with one who had studied the subject , he ordered me to accompany asellius ' cohort and balbutius had also come along to press his adverse advice , for he honestly believed that drastic military action would stir up a dangerous sentiment of unrest amongst the vascones both tribal and settled .
so here we all were in the mystic sunset of the autumn hills old scribonius libo in his toga prætexta , the golden light glancing on his shiny bald head and wrinkled hawk face , balbutius with his gleaming helmet and breastplate , lips compressed in conscientiously dogged opposition , young asellius with his polished greaves and superior sneer , and the curious throng of townsfolk , legionaries , tribesmen , peasants , lictors , slaves , and attendants .
i myself seemed to wear a common toga , and to have no especially distinguishing characteristic .
and everywhere horror brooded .
the town and country folk scarcely dared speak aloud , and the men of libo entourage , who had been there nearly a week , seemed to have caught something of the nameless dread .
old scribonius himself looked very grave , and the sharp voices of us later comers seemed to hold something of curious inappropriateness , as in a place of death or the temple of some mystic god .
we entered the prætorium and held grave converse .
balbutius pressed his objections , and was sustained by asellius , who appeared to hold all the natives in extreme contempt while at the same time deeming it inadvisable to excite them .
both soldiers maintained that we could better afford to antagonise the minority of colonists and civilised natives by inaction , than to antagonise a probable majority of tribesmen and cottagers by stamping out the dread rites .
i , on the other hand , renewed my demand for action , and offered to accompany the cohort on any expedition it might undertake .
i pointed out that the barbarous vascones were at best turbulent and uncertain , so that skirmishes with them were inevitable sooner or later whichever course we might take ; that they had not in the past proved dangerous adversaries to our legions , and that it would ill become the representatives of the roman people to suffer barbarians to interfere with a course which the justice and prestige of the republic demanded .
that , on the other hand , the successful administration of a province depended primarily upon the safety and of the civilised element in whose hands the local machinery of commerce and prosperity reposed , and in whose veins a large mixture of our own italian blood coursed .
these , though in numbers they might form a minority , were the stable element whose constancy might be relied on , and whose cooperation would most firmly bind the province to the imperium of the senate and the roman people .
it was at once a duty and an advantage to afford them the protection due to roman citizens ; even ( and here i shot a sarcastic look at balbutius and asellius ) at the expense of a little trouble and activity , and of a slight interruption of the and at the camp in calagurris .
that the danger to the town and inhabitants of pompelo was a real one , i could not from my studies doubt .
i had read many scrolls out of syria and ægyptus , and the cryptic towns of etruria , and had talked at length with the bloodthirsty priest of diana aricina in his temple in the woods bordering lacus nemorensis .
there were shocking dooms that might be called out of the hills on the sabbaths ; dooms which ought not to exist within the territories of the roman people ; and to permit orgies of the kind known to prevail at sabbaths would be but little in consonance with the customs of those whose forefathers , postumius being consul , had executed so many roman citizens for the practice of the bacchanalia a matter kept ever in memory by the senatus consultum de bacchanalibus , graven upon bronze and set open to every eye .
checked in time , before the progress of the rites might evoke anything with which the iron of a roman pilum might not be able to deal , the sabbath would not be too much for the powers of a single cohort .
only participants need be apprehended , and the sparing of a great number of mere spectators would considerably lessen the resentment which any of the sympathising country folk might feel .
in short , both principle and policy demanded stern action ; and i could not doubt but that publius scribonius , bearing in mind the dignity and obligations of the roman people , would adhere to his plan of despatching the cohort , me accompanying , despite such objections as balbutius and asellius indeed more like provincials than romans might see fit to offer and multiply .
the slanting sun was now very low , and the whole hushed town seemed draped in an unreal and malign glamour .
then scribonius the proconsul signified his approval of my words , and stationed me with the cohort in the provisional capacity of a centurio primipilus ; balbutius and asellius assenting , the former with better grace than the latter .
as twilight fell on the wild autumnal slopes , a measured , hideous beating of strange drums floated down from afar in terrible rhythm .
some few of the legionarii shewed timidity , but sharp commands brought them into line , and the whole cohort was soon drawn up on the open plain east of the circus .
libo himself , as well as balbutius , insisted on accompanying the cohort ; but great difficulty was suffered in getting a native guide to point out the paths up the mountain .
finally a young man named vercellius , the son of pure roman parents , agreed to take us at least past the foothills .
we began to march in the new dusk , with the thin silver sickle of a young moon trembling over the woods on our left .
that which disquieted us most was the fact that the sabbath was to be held at all .
reports of the coming cohort must have reached the hills , and even the lack of a final decision could not make the rumour less alarming yet there were the sinister drums as of yore , as if the celebrants had some peculiar reason to be indifferent whether or not the forces of the roman people marched against them .
the sound grew louder as we entered a rising gap in the hills , steep wooded banks enclosing us narrowly on either side , and displaying curiously fantastic in the light of our bobbing torches .
all were afoot save libo , balbutius , asellius , two or three of the centuriones , and myself , and at length the way became so steep and narrow that those who had horses were forced to leave them ; a squad of ten men being left to guard them , though robber bands were not likely to be abroad on such a night of terror .
once in a while it seemed as though we detected a skulking form in the woods nearby , and after a climb the steepness and narrowness of the way made the advance of so great a body of men over , all told exceedingly cumbrous and difficult .
then with utter and horrifying suddenness we heard a frightful sound from below .
it was from the tethered horses they had screamed , not neighed , but screamed and there was no light down there , nor the sound of any human thing , to shew why they had done so .
at the same moment bonfires blazed out on all the peaks ahead , so that terror seemed to lurk equally well before and behind us .
looking for the youth vercellius , our guide , we found only a crumpled heap weltering in a pool of blood .
in his hand was a short sword snatched from the belt of vibulanus , a subcenturio , and on his face was such a look of terror that the stoutest veterans turned pale at the sight .
he had killed himself when the horses screamed he , who had been born and lived all his life in that region , and knew what men whispered about the hills .
all the torches now began to dim , and the cries of frightened legionaries mingled with the unceasing screams of the tethered horses .
the air grew perceptibly colder , more suddenly so than is usual at november brink , and seemed stirred by terrible undulations which i could not help connecting with the beating of huge wings .
the whole cohort now remained at a standstill , and as the torches faded i watched what i thought were fantastic shadows outlined in the sky by the spectral luminosity of the via lactea as it flowed through perseus , cassiopeia , cepheus , and cygnus .
then suddenly all the stars were blotted from the sky even bright deneb and vega ahead , and the lone altair and fomalhaut behind us .
and as the torches died out altogether , there remained above the stricken and shrieking cohort only the noxious and horrible on the towering peaks ; hellish and red , and now silhouetting the mad , leaping , and colossal forms of such nameless beasts as had never a phrygian priest or campanian grandam whispered of in the wildest of furtive tales .
and above the nighted screaming of men and horses that dæmonic drumming rose to louder pitch , whilst an wind of shocking sentience and deliberateness swept down from those forbidden heights and coiled about each man separately , till all the cohort was struggling and screaming in the dark , as if acting out the fate of laocoön and his sons .
only old scribonius libo seemed resigned .
he uttered words amidst the screaming , and they echo still in my ears .
malitia vetus malitia vetus est venit tandem venit ( wickedness of old it is wickedness of old happened happened at last ) and then i waked .
it was the most vivid dream in years , drawing upon wells of the subconscious long untouched and forgotten .
of the fate of that cohort no record exists , but the town at least was saved for encyclopædias tell of the survival of pompelo to this day , under the modern spanish name of pompelona yrs for gothick supremacy c .
