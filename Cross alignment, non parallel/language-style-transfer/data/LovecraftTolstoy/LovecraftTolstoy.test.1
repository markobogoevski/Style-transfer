no , this can t go on !
he said to himself in despair .
i ll go to her ; i ll ask her ; i ll say for the last time we are free , and hadn t we better stay so ?
anything s better than endless misery , disgrace , unfaithfulness !
with despair in his heart and bitter anger against all men , against himself , against her , he went out of the hotel and drove to her house .
he found her in one of the back rooms .
she was sitting on a chest and making some arrangements with her maid , sorting over heaps of dresses of different colors , spread on the backs of chairs and on the floor .
ah !
she cried , seeing him , and beaming with delight .
kostya !
konstantin dmitrievitch !
( these latter days she used these names almost alternately . )
i didn t expect you !
i m going through my wardrobe to see what s for whom oh !
that s very nice !
he said gloomily , looking at the maid .
you can go , dunyasha , i ll call you presently , said kitty .
kostya , what s the matter ?
she asked , definitely adopting this familiar name as soon as the maid had gone out .
she noticed his strange face , agitated and gloomy , and a panic came over her .
kitty !
i m in torture .
i can t suffer alone , he said with despair in his voice , standing before her and looking imploringly into her eyes .
he saw already from her loving , truthful face , that nothing could come of what he had meant to say , but yet he wanted her to reassure him herself .
i ve come to say that there s still time .
this can all be stopped and set right .
what ?
i don t understand .
what is the matter ?
what i have said a thousand times over , and can t help thinking that i m not worthy of you .
you couldn t consent to marry me .
think a little .
you ve made a mistake .
think it over thoroughly .
you can t love me
if better say so , he said , not looking at her .
i shall be wretched .
let people say what they like ; anything s better than misery far better now while there s still time i don t understand , she answered , ; you mean you want to give it up don t want it ?
yes , if you don t love me .
you re out of your mind !
she cried , turning crimson with vexation .
but his face was so piteous , that she restrained her vexation , and flinging some clothes off an , she sat down beside him .
what are you thinking ?
tell me all .
i am thinking you can t love me .
what can you love me for ?
my god !
what can i do ?
she said , and burst into tears .
oh !
what have i done ?
he cried , and kneeling before her , he fell to kissing her hands .
when the princess came into the room five minutes later , she found them completely reconciled .
kitty had not simply assured him that she loved him , but had gone so answer to his question , what she loved him to explain what for .
she told him that she loved him because she understood him completely , because she knew what he would like , and because everything he liked was good .
and this seemed to him perfectly clear .
when the princess came to them , they were sitting side by side on the chest , sorting the dresses and disputing over kitty s wanting to give dunyasha the brown dress she had been wearing when levin proposed to her , while he insisted that that dress must never be given away , but dunyasha must have the blue one .
how is it you don t see ?
she s a brunette , and it won t suit her i ve worked it all out .
hearing why he had come , the princess was half humorously , half seriously angry with him , and sent him home to dress and not to hinder kitty s , as charles the was just coming .
as it is , she s been eating nothing lately and is losing her looks , and then you must come and upset her with your nonsense , she said to him .
get along with you , my dear !
levin , guilty and shamefaced , but pacified , went back to his hotel .
his brother , darya alexandrovna , and stepan arkadyevitch , all in full dress , were waiting for him to bless him with the holy picture .
there was no time to lose .
darya alexandrovna had to drive home again to fetch her curled and pomaded son , who was to carry the holy pictures after the bride .
then a carriage had to be sent for the best man , and another that would take sergey ivanovitch away would have to be sent back
altogether there were a great many most complicated matters to be considered and arranged .
one thing was unmistakable , that there must be no delay , as it was already six .
nothing special happened at the ceremony of benediction with the holy picture .
stepan arkadyevitch stood in a comically solemn pose beside his wife , took the holy picture , and telling levin to bow down to the ground , he blessed him with his kindly , ironical smile , and kissed him three times ; darya alexandrovna did the same , and immediately was in a hurry to get off , and again plunged into the intricate question of the destinations of the various carriages .
come , i ll tell you how we ll manage you drive in our carriage to fetch him , and sergey ivanovitch , if he ll be so good , will drive there and then send his carriage .
of course ; i shall be delighted .
we ll come on directly with him .
are your things sent off ?
said stepan arkadyevitch .
yes , answered levin , and he told kouzma to put out his clothes for him to dress .
a crowd of people , principally women , was thronging round the church lighted up for the wedding .
those who had not succeeded in getting into the main entrance were crowding about the windows , pushing , wrangling , and peeping through the gratings .
more than twenty carriages had already been drawn up in ranks along the street by the police .
a police officer , regardless of the frost , stood at the entrance , gorgeous in his uniform .
more carriages were continually driving up , and ladies wearing flowers and carrying their trains , and men taking off their helmets or black hats kept walking into the church .
inside the church both lusters were already lighted , and all the candles before the holy pictures .
the gilt on the red ground of the holy , and the gilt relief on the pictures , and the silver of the lusters and candlesticks , and the stones of the floor , and the rugs , and the banners above in the choir , and the steps of the altar , and the old blackened books , and the cassocks and were flooded with light .
on the right side of the warm church , in the crowd of frock coats and white ties , uniforms and broadcloth , velvet , satin , hair and flowers , bare shoulders and arms and long gloves , there was discreet but lively conversation that echoed strangely in the high cupola .
every time there was heard the creak of the opened door the conversation in the crowd died away , and everybody looked round expecting to see the bride and bridegroom come in .
but the door had opened more than ten times , and each time it was either a belated guest or guests , who joined the circle of the invited on the right , or a spectator , who had eluded or softened the police officer , and went to join the crowd of outsiders on the left .
both the guests and the outside public had by now passed through all the phases of anticipation .
at first they imagined that the bride and bridegroom would arrive immediately , and attached no importance at all to their being late .
then they began to look more and more often towards the door , and to talk of whether anything could have happened .
then the long delay began to be positively discomforting , and relations and guests tried to look as if they were not thinking of the bridegroom but were engrossed in conversation .
the head deacon , as though to remind them of the value of his time , coughed impatiently , making the quiver in their frames .
in the choir the bored choristers could be heard trying their voices and blowing their noses .
the priest was continually sending first the beadle and then the deacon to find out whether the bridegroom had not come , more and more often he went himself , in a lilac vestment and an embroidered sash , to the side door , expecting to see the bridegroom .
at last one of the ladies , glancing at her watch , said , it really is strange , though !
and all the guests became uneasy and began loudly expressing their wonder and dissatisfaction .
one of the bridegroom s best men went to find out what had happened .
kitty meanwhile had long ago been quite ready , and in her white dress and long veil and wreath of orange blossoms she was standing in the of the shtcherbatskys house with her sister , madame lvova , who was her .
she was looking out of the window , and had been for over half an hour anxiously expecting to hear from the best man that her bridegroom was at the church .
levin meanwhile , in his trousers , but without his coat and waistcoat , was walking to and fro in his room at the hotel , continually putting his head out of the door and looking up and down the corridor .
but in the corridor there was no sign of the person he was looking for and he came back in despair , and frantically waving his hands addressed stepan arkadyevitch , who was smoking serenely .
was ever a man in such a fearful fool s position ?
he said .
yes , it is stupid , stepan arkadyevitch assented , smiling soothingly .
but don t worry , it ll be brought directly .
no , what is to be done !
said levin , with smothered fury .
and these fools of open waistcoats !
out of the question !
he said , looking at the crumpled front of his shirt .
and what if the things have been taken on to the railway station !
he roared in desperation .
then you must put on mine .
i ought to have done so long ago , if at all .
it s not nice to look ridiculous
wait a bit !
it will .
the point was that when levin asked for his evening suit , kouzma , his old servant , had brought him the coat , waistcoat , and everything that was wanted .
but the shirt !
cried levin .
you ve got a shirt on , kouzma answered , with a placid smile .
kouzma had not thought of leaving out a clean shirt , and on receiving instructions to pack up everything and send it round to the shtcherbatskys house , from which the young people were to set out the same evening , he had done so , packing everything but the dress suit .
the shirt worn since the morning was crumpled and out of the question with the fashionable open waistcoat .
it was a long way to send to the shtcherbatskys .
they sent out to buy a shirt .
the servant came back ; everything was shut was sunday .
they sent to stepan arkadyevitch s and brought a was impossibly wide and short .
they sent finally to the shtcherbatskys to unpack the things .
the bridegroom was expected at the church while he was pacing up and down his room like a wild beast in a cage , peeping out into the corridor , and with horror and despair recalling what absurd things he had said to kitty and what she might be thinking now .
at last the guilty kouzma flew panting into the room with the shirt .
only just in time .
they were just lifting it into the van , said kouzma .
three minutes later levin ran full speed into the corridor , not looking at his watch for fear of aggravating his sufferings .
you won t help matters like this , said stepan arkadyevitch with a smile , hurrying with more deliberation after him .
it will come round , it will come round
i tell you .
they ve come !
here he is !
which one ?
rather young , eh ?
why , my dear soul , she looks more dead than alive !
were the comments in the crowd , when levin , meeting his bride in the entrance , walked with her into the church .
stepan arkadyevitch told his wife the cause of the delay , and the guests were whispering it with smiles to one another .
levin saw nothing and no one ; he did not take his eyes off his bride .
everyone said she had lost her looks dreadfully of late , and was not nearly so pretty on her wedding day as usual ; but levin did not think so .
he looked at her hair done up high , with the long white veil and white flowers and the high , , scalloped collar , that in such a maidenly fashion hid her long neck at the sides and only showed it in front , her strikingly slender figure , and it seemed to him that she looked better than because these flowers , this veil , this gown from paris added anything to her beauty ; but because , in spite of the elaborate sumptuousness of her attire , the expression of her sweet face , of her eyes , of her lips was still her own characteristic expression of guileless truthfulness .
i was beginning to think you meant to run away , she said , and smiled to him .
it s so stupid , what happened to me , i m ashamed to speak of it !
he said , reddening , and he was obliged to turn to sergey ivanovitch , who came up to him .
this is a pretty story of yours about the shirt !
said sergey ivanovitch , shaking his head and smiling .
yes , yes !
answered levin , without an idea of what they were talking about .
now , kostya , you have to decide , said stepan arkadyevitch with an air of mock dismay , a weighty question .
you are at this moment just in the humor to appreciate all its gravity .
they ask me , are they to light the candles that have been lighted before or candles that have never been lighted ?
it s a matter of ten roubles , he added , relaxing his lips into a smile .
i have decided , but i was afraid you might not agree .
levin saw it was a joke , but he could not smile .
well , how s it to be then ? or lighted candles ?
that s the question .
yes , yes , unlighted .
oh , i m very glad .
the question s decided !
said stepan arkadyevitch , smiling .
how silly men are , though , in this position , he said to tchirikov , when levin , after looking absently at him , had moved back to his bride .
kitty , mind you re the first to step on the carpet , said countess nordston , coming up .
you re a nice person !
she said to levin .
aren t you frightened , eh ?
said marya dmitrievna , an old aunt .
are you cold ?
you re pale .
stop a minute , stoop down , said kitty s sister , madame lvova , and with her plump , handsome arms she smilingly set straight the flowers on her head .
dolly came up , tried to say something , but could not speak , cried , and then laughed unnaturally .
kitty looked at all of them with the same absent eyes as levin .
meanwhile the officiating clergy had got into their vestments , and the priest and deacon came out to the lectern , which stood in the forepart of the church .
the priest turned to levin saying something .
levin did not hear what the priest said .
take the bride s hand and lead her up , the best man said to levin .
it was a long while before levin could make out what was expected of him .
for a long time they tried to set him right and made him begin he kept taking kitty by the wrong arm or with the wrong he understood at last that what he had to do was , without changing his position , to take her right hand in his right hand .
when at last he had taken the bride s hand in the correct way , the priest walked a few paces in front of them and stopped at the lectern .
the crowd of friends and relations moved after them , with a buzz of talk and a rustle of skirts .
someone stooped down and pulled out the bride s train .
the church became so still that the drops of wax could be heard falling from the candles .
the little old priest in his ecclesiastical cap , with his long locks of hair parted behind his ears , was fumbling with something at the lectern , putting out his little old hands from under the heavy silver vestment with the gold cross on the back of it .
stepan arkadyevitch approached him cautiously , whispered something , and making a sign to levin , walked back again .
the priest lighted two candles , wreathed with flowers , and holding them sideways so that the wax dropped slowly from them he turned , facing the bridal pair .
the priest was the same old man that had confessed levin .
he looked with weary and melancholy eyes at the bride and bridegroom , sighed , and putting his right hand out from his vestment , blessed the bridegroom with it , and also with a shade of solicitous tenderness laid the crossed fingers on the bowed head of kitty .
then he gave them the candles , and taking the censer , moved slowly away from them .
can it be true ?
thought levin , and he looked round at his bride .
looking down at her he saw her face in profile , and from the scarcely perceptible quiver of her lips and eyelashes he knew she was aware of his eyes upon her .
she did not look round , but the high scalloped collar , that reached her little pink ear , trembled faintly .
he saw that a sigh was held back in her throat , and the little hand in the long glove shook as it held the candle .
all the fuss of the shirt , of being late , all the talk of friends and relations , their annoyance , his ludicrous suddenly passed away and he was filled with joy and dread .
the handsome , stately wearing a silver robe and his curly locks standing out at each side of his head , stepped smartly forward , and lifting his stole on two fingers , stood opposite the priest .
blessed be the name of the lord , the solemn syllables rang out slowly one after another , setting the air quivering with waves of sound .
blessed is the name of our god , from the beginning , is now , and ever shall be , the little old priest answered in a submissive , piping voice , still fingering something at the lectern .
and the full chorus of the unseen choir rose up , filling the whole church , from the windows to the vaulted roof , with broad waves of melody .
it grew stronger , rested for an instant , and slowly died away .
they prayed , as they always do , for peace from on high and for salvation , for the holy synod , and for the tsar ; they prayed , too , for the servants of god , konstantin and ekaterina , now plighting their troth .
vouchsafe to them love made perfect , peace and help , o lord , we beseech thee , the whole church seemed to breathe with the voice of the head deacon .
levin heard the words , and they impressed him .
how did they guess that it is help , just help that one wants ?
he thought , recalling all his fears and doubts of late .
what do i know ?
what can i do in this fearful business , he thought , without help ?
yes , it is help i want now .
when the deacon had finished the prayer for the imperial family , the priest turned to the bridal pair with a book eternal god , that joinest together in love them that were separate , he read in a gentle , piping voice who hast ordained the union of holy wedlock that can not be set asunder , thou who didst bless isaac and rebecca and their descendants , according to thy holy covenant ; bless thy servants , konstantin and ekaterina , leading them in the path of all good works .
for gracious and merciful art thou , our lord , and glory be to thee , the father , the son , and the holy ghost , now and ever shall be .
amen !
the unseen choir sent rolling again upon the air .
joinest together in love them that were what deep meaning in those words , and how they correspond with what one feels at this moment , thought levin .
is she feeling the same as i ?
and looking round , he met her eyes , and from their expression he concluded that she was understanding it just as he was .
but this was a mistake ; she almost completely missed the meaning of the words of the service ; she had not heard them , in fact .
she could not listen to them and take them in , so strong was the one feeling that filled her breast and grew stronger and stronger .
that feeling was joy at the completion of the process that for the last month and a half had been going on in her soul , and had during those six weeks been a joy and a torture to her .
on the day when in the drawing room of the house in arbaty street she had gone up to him in her brown dress , and given herself to him without a that day , at that hour , there took place in her heart a complete severance from all her old life , and a quite different , new , utterly strange life had begun for her , while the old life was actually going on as before .
those six weeks had for her been a time of the utmost bliss and the utmost misery .
all her life , all her desires and hopes were concentrated on this one man , still uncomprehended by her , to whom she was bound by a feeling of alternate attraction and repulsion , even less comprehended than the man himself , and all the while she was going on living in the outward conditions of her old life .
living the old life , she was horrified at herself , at her utter insurmountable callousness to all her own past , to things , to habits , to the people she had loved , who loved her mother , who was wounded by her indifference , to her kind , tender father , till then dearer than all the world .
at one moment she was horrified at this indifference , at another she rejoiced at what had brought her to this indifference .
she could not frame a thought , not a wish apart from life with this man ; but this new life was not yet , and she could not even picture it clearly to herself .
there was only anticipation , the dread and joy of the new and the unknown .
and now and uncertainty and remorse at the abandonment of the old was ending , and the new was beginning .
this new life could not but have terrors for her inexperience ; but , terrible or not , the change had been wrought six weeks before in her soul , and this was merely the final sanction of what had long been completed in her heart .
turning again to the lectern , the priest with some difficulty took kitty s little ring , and asking levin for his hand , put it on the first joint of his finger .
the servant of god , konstantin , plights his troth to the servant of god , ekaterina .
and putting his big ring on kitty s touchingly weak , pink little finger , the priest said the same thing .
and the bridal pair tried several times to understand what they had to do , and each time made some mistake and were corrected by the priest in a whisper .
at last , having duly performed the ceremony , having signed the rings with the cross , the priest handed kitty the big ring , and levin the little one .
again they were puzzled , and passed the rings from hand to hand , still without doing what was expected .
dolly , tchirikov , and stepan arkadyevitch stepped forward to set them right .
there was an interval of hesitation , whispering , and smiles ; but the expression of solemn emotion on the faces of the betrothed pair did not change on the contrary , in their perplexity over their hands they looked more grave and deeply moved than before , and the smile with which stepan arkadyevitch whispered to them that now they would each put on their own ring died away on his lips .
he had a feeling that any smile would jar on them .
thou who didst from the beginning create male and female , the priest read after the exchange of rings , from thee woman was given to man to be a helpmeet to him , and for the procreation of children .
o lord , our god , who hast poured down the blessings of thy truth according to thy holy covenant upon thy chosen servants , our fathers , from generation to generation , bless thy servants konstantin and ekaterina , and make their troth fast in faith , and union of hearts , and truth , and love levin felt more and more that all his ideas of marriage , all his dreams of how he would order his life , were mere childishness , and that it was something he had not understood hitherto , and now understood less than ever , though it was being performed upon him .
the lump in his throat rose higher and higher , tears that would not be checked came into his eyes .
in the church there was all moscow , all the friends and relations ; and during the ceremony of plighting troth , in the brilliantly lighted church , there was an incessant flow of discreetly subdued talk in the circle of gaily dressed women and girls , and men in white ties , frockcoats , and uniforms .
the talk was principally kept up by the men , while the women were absorbed in watching every detail of the ceremony , which always means so much to them .
in the little group nearest to the bride were her two sisters dolly , and the other one , the beauty , madame lvova , who had just arrived from abroad .
why is it marie s in lilac , as bad as black , at a wedding ?
said madame korsunskaya .
with her complexion , it s the one salvation , responded madame trubetskaya .
i wonder why they had the wedding in the evening ?
it s like so much prettier .
i was married in the evening too answered madame korsunskaya , and she sighed , remembering how charming she had been that day , and how absurdly in love her husband was , and how different it all was now .
they say if anyone s best man more than ten times , he ll never be married .
i wanted to be for the tenth time , but the post was taken , said count siniavin to the pretty princess tcharskaya , who had designs on him .
princess tcharskaya only answered with a smile .
she looked at kitty , thinking how and when she would stand with count siniavin in kitty s place , and how she would remind him then of his joke today .
shtcherbatsky told the old maid of honor , madame nikolaeva , that he meant to put the crown on kitty s chignon for luck .
she ought not to have worn a chignon , answered madame nikolaeva , who had long ago made up her mind that if the elderly widower she was angling for married her , the wedding should be of the simplest .
i don t like such grandeur .
sergey ivanovitch was talking to darya dmitrievna , jestingly assuring her that the custom of going away after the wedding was becoming common because newly married people always felt a little ashamed of themselves .
your brother may feel proud of himself .
she s a marvel of sweetness .
i believe you re envious .
oh , i ve got over that , darya dmitrievna , he answered , and a melancholy and serious expression suddenly came over his face .
stepan arkadyevitch was telling his his joke about divorce .
the wreath wants setting straight , she answered , not hearing him .
what a pity she s lost her looks so , countess nordston said to madame lvova .
still he s not worth her little finger , is he ?
oh , i like him because he s my future , answered madame lvova .
and how well he s behaving !
it s so difficult , too , to look well in such a position , not to be ridiculous .
and he s not ridiculous , and not affected ; one can see he s moved .
you expected it , i suppose ?
almost .
she always cared for him .
well , we shall see which of them will step on the rug first .
i warned kitty .
it will make no difference , said madame lvova ; we re all obedient wives ; it s in our family .
oh , i stepped on the rug before vassily on purpose .
and you , dolly ?
dolly stood beside them ; she heard them , but she did not answer .
she was deeply moved .
the tears stood in her eyes , and she could not have spoken without crying .
she was rejoicing over kitty and levin ; going back in thought to her own wedding , she glanced at the radiant figure of stepan arkadyevitch , forgot all the present , and remembered only her own innocent love .
she recalled not herself only , but all her and acquaintances .
she thought of them on the one day of their triumph , when they had stood like kitty under the wedding crown , with love and hope and dread in their hearts , renouncing the past , and stepping forward into the mysterious future .
among the brides that came back to her memory , she thought too of her darling anna , of whose proposed divorce she had just been hearing .
and she had stood just as innocent in orange flowers and bridal veil .
and now ?
it s terribly strange , she said to herself .
it was not merely the sisters , the and female relations of the bride who were following every detail of the ceremony .
women who were quite strangers , mere spectators , were watching it excitedly , holding their breath , in fear of losing a single movement or expression of the bride and bridegroom , and angrily not answering , often not hearing , the remarks of the callous men , who kept making joking or irrelevant observations .
why has she been crying ?
is she being married against her will ?
against her will to a fine fellow like that ?
a prince , isn t he ?
is that her sister in the white satin ?
just listen how the deacon booms out , and fearing her are the choristers from tchudovo ?
no , from the synod .
i asked the footman .
he says he s going to take her home to his country place at once .
awfully rich , they say .
that s why she s being married to him .
no , they re a pair .
i say , marya vassilievna , you were making out those crinolines were not being worn .
just look at her in the puce ambassador s wife they say she her skirt bounces out from side to side !
what a pretty dear the bride a lamb decked with flowers !
well , say what you will , we women feel for our sister .
such were the comments in the crowd of gazing women who had succeeded in slipping in at the church doors .
when the ceremony of plighting troth was over , the beadle spread before the lectern in the middle of the church a piece of pink silken stuff , the choir sang a complicated and elaborate psalm , in which the bass and tenor sang responses to one another , and the priest turning round pointed the bridal pair to the pink silk rug .
though both had often heard a great deal about the saying that the one who steps first on the rug will be the head of the house , neither levin nor kitty were capable of recollecting it , as they took the few steps towards it .
they did not hear the loud remarks and disputes that followed , some maintaining he had stepped on first , and others that both had stepped on together .
after the customary questions , whether they desired to enter upon matrimony , and whether they were pledged to anyone else , and their answers , which sounded strange to themselves , a new ceremony began .
kitty listened to the words of the prayer , trying to make out their meaning , but she could not .
the feeling of triumph and radiant happiness flooded her soul more and more as the ceremony went on , and deprived her of all power of attention .
they prayed endow them with continence and fruitfulness , and vouchsafe that their hearts may rejoice looking upon their sons and daughters .
they alluded to god s creation of a wife from adam s rib and for this cause a man shall leave father and mother , and cleave unto his wife , and they two shall be one flesh , and that this is a great mystery ; they prayed that god would make them fruitful and bless them , like isaac and rebecca , joseph , moses and zipporah , and that they might look upon their children s children .
that s all splendid , thought kitty , catching the words , all that s just as it should be , and a smile of happiness , unconsciously reflected in everyone who looked at her , beamed on her radiant face .
put it on quite , voices were heard urging when the priest had put on the wedding crowns and shtcherbatsky , his hand shaking in its glove , held the crown high above her head .
put it on !
she whispered , smiling .
levin looked round at her , and was struck by the joyful radiance on her face , and unconsciously her feeling infected him .
he too , like her felt glad and happy .
they enjoyed hearing the epistle read , and the roll of the head deacon s voice at the last verse , awaited with such impatience by the outside public .
they enjoyed drinking out of the shallow cup of warm red wine and water , and they were still more pleased when the priest , flinging back his stole and taking both their hands in his , led them round the lectern to the accompaniment of bass voices chanting glory to god .
shtcherbatsky and tchirikov , supporting the crowns and stumbling over the bride s train , smiling too and seeming delighted at something , were at one moment left behind , at the next treading on the bridal pair as the priest came to a halt .
the spark of joy kindled in kitty seemed to have infected everyone in the church .
it seemed to levin that the priest and the deacon too wanted to smile just as he did .
taking the crowns off their heads the priest read the last prayer and congratulated the young people .
levin looked at kitty , and he had never before seen her look as she did .
she was charming with the new radiance of happiness in her face .
levin longed to say something to her , but he did not know whether it was all over .
the priest got him out of his difficulty .
he smiled his kindly smile and said gently , kiss your wife , and you kiss your husband , and took the candles out of their hands .
levin kissed her smiling lips with timid care , gave her his arm , and with a new strange sense of closeness , walked out of the church .
he did not believe , he could not believe , that it was true .
it was only when their wondering and timid eyes met that he believed in it , because he felt that they were one .
after supper , the same night , the young people left for the country .
vronsky and anna had been traveling for three months together in europe .
they had visited venice , rome , and naples , and had just arrived at a small italian town where they meant to stay some time .
a handsome head waiter , with thick pomaded hair parted from the neck upwards , an evening coat , a broad white cambric shirt front , and a bunch of trinkets hanging above his rounded stomach , stood with his hands in the full curve of his pockets , looking contemptuously from under his eyelids while he gave some frigid reply to a gentleman who had stopped him .
catching the sound of footsteps coming from the other side of the entry towards the staircase , the head waiter turned round , and seeing the russian count , who had taken their best rooms , he took his hands out of his pockets deferentially , and with a bow informed him that a courier had been , and that the business about the palazzo had been arranged .
the steward was prepared to sign the agreement .
ah !
i m glad to hear it , said vronsky .
is madame at home or not ?
madame has been out for a walk but has returned now , answered the waiter .
vronsky took off his soft , hat and passed his handkerchief over his heated brow and hair , which had grown half over his ears , and was brushed back covering the bald patch on his head .
and glancing casually at the gentleman , who still stood there gazing intently at him , he would have gone on .
this gentleman is a russian , and was inquiring after you , said the head waiter .
with mingled feelings of annoyance at never being able to get away from acquaintances anywhere , and longing to find some sort of diversion from the monotony of his life , vronsky looked once more at the gentleman , who had retreated and stood still again , and at the same moment a light came into the eyes of both .
golenishtchev !
vronsky !
it really was golenishtchev , a comrade of vronsky s in the corps of pages .
in the corps golenishtchev had belonged to the liberal party ; he left the corps without entering the army , and had never taken office under the government .
vronsky and he had gone completely different ways on leaving the corps , and had only met once since .
at that meeting vronsky perceived that golenishtchev had taken up a sort of lofty , intellectually liberal line , and was consequently disposed to look down upon vronsky s interests and calling in life .
hence vronsky had met him with the chilling and haughty manner he so well knew how to assume , the meaning of which was you may like or dislike my way of life , that s a matter of the most perfect indifference to me ; you will have to treat me with respect if you want to know me .
golenishtchev had been contemptuously indifferent to the tone taken by vronsky .
this second meeting might have been expected , one would have supposed , to estrange them still more .
but now they beamed and exclaimed with delight on recognizing one another .
vronsky would never have expected to be so pleased to see golenishtchev , but probably he was not himself aware how bored he was .
he forgot the disagreeable impression of their last meeting , and with a face of frank delight held out his hand to his old comrade .
the same expression of delight replaced the look of uneasiness on golenishtchev s face .
how glad i am to meet you !
said vronsky , showing his strong white teeth in a friendly smile .
i heard the name vronsky , but i didn t know which one .
i m very , very glad !
let s go in .
come , tell me what you re doing .
i ve been living here for two years .
i m working .
ah !
said vronsky , with sympathy ; let s go in .
and with the habit common with russians , instead of saying in russian what he wanted to keep from the servants , he began to speak in french .
do you know madame karenina ?
we are traveling together .
i am going to see her now , he said in french , carefully scrutinizing golenishtchev s face .
ah !
i did not know ( though he did know ) , golenishtchev answered carelessly .
have you been here long ?
he added .
four days , vronsky answered , once more scrutinizing his friend s face intently .
yes , he s a decent fellow , and will look at the thing properly , vronsky said to himself , catching the significance of golenishtchev s face and the change of subject .
i can introduce him to anna , he looks at it properly .
during those three months that vronsky had spent abroad with anna , he had always on meeting new people asked himself how the new person would look at his relations with anna , and for the most part , in men , he had met with the proper way of looking at it .
but if he had been asked , and those who looked at it properly had been asked , exactly how they did look at it , both he and they would have been greatly puzzled to answer .
in reality , those who in vronsky s opinion had the proper view had no sort of view at all , but behaved in general as persons do behave in regard to all the complex and insoluble problems with which life is encompassed on all sides ; they behaved with propriety , avoiding allusions and unpleasant questions .
they assumed an air of fully comprehending the import and force of the situation , of accepting and even approving of it , but of considering it superfluous and uncalled for to put all this into words .
vronsky at once divined that golenishtchev was of this class , and therefore was doubly pleased to see him .
and in fact , golenishtchev s manner to madame karenina , when he was taken to call on her , was all that vronsky could have desired .
obviously without the slightest effort he steered clear of all subjects which might lead to embarrassment .
he had never met anna before , and was struck by her beauty , and still more by the frankness with which she accepted her position .
she blushed when vronsky brought in golenishtchev , and he was extremely charmed by this childish blush overspreading her candid and handsome face .
but what he liked particularly was the way in which at once , as though on purpose that there might be no misunderstanding with an outsider , she called vronsky simply alexey , and said they were moving into a house they had just taken , what was here called a palazzo .
golenishtchev liked this direct and simple attitude to her own position .
looking at anna s manner of , spirited gaiety , and knowing alexey alexandrovitch and vronsky , golenishtchev fancied that he understood her perfectly .
he fancied that he understood what she was utterly unable to understand how it was that , having made her husband wretched , having abandoned him and her son and lost her good name , she yet felt full of spirits , gaiety , and happiness .
it s in the , said golenishtchev , referring to the palazzo vronsky had taken .
there s a tintoretto there .
one of his latest period .
i tell you what it s a lovely day , let s go and have another look at it , said vronsky , addressing anna .
i shall be very glad to ; i ll go and put on my hat .
would you say it s hot ?
she said , stopping short in the doorway and looking inquiringly at vronsky .
and again a vivid flush overspread her face .
vronsky saw from her eyes that she did not know on what terms he cared to be with golenishtchev , and so was afraid of not behaving as he would wish .
he looked a long , tender look at her .
no , not very , he said .
and it seemed to her that she understood everything , most of all , that he was pleased with her ; and smiling to him , she walked with her rapid step out at the door .
the friends glanced at one another , and a look of hesitation came into both faces , as though golenishtchev , unmistakably admiring her , would have liked to say something about her , and could not find the right thing to say , while vronsky desired and dreaded his doing so .
well then , vronsky began to start a conversation of some sort ; so you re settled here ?
you re still at the same work , then ?
he went on , recalling that he had been told golenishtchev was writing something .
yes , i m writing the second part of the , said golenishtchev , coloring with pleasure at the that is , to be exact , i am not writing it yet ; i am preparing , collecting materials .
it will be of far wider scope , and will touch on almost all questions .
we in russia refuse to see that we are the heirs of byzantium , and he launched into a long and heated explanation of his views .
vronsky at the first moment felt embarrassed at not even knowing of the first part of the , of which the author spoke as something well known .
but as golenishtchev began to lay down his opinions and vronsky was able to follow them even without knowing the , he listened to him with some interest , for golenishtchev spoke well .
but vronsky was startled and annoyed by the nervous irascibility with which golenishtchev talked of the subject that engrossed him .
as he went on talking , his eyes glittered more and more angrily ; he was more and more hurried in his replies to imaginary opponents , and his face grew more and more excited and worried .
remembering golenishtchev , a thin , lively , and boy , always at the head of the class , vronsky could not make out the reason of his irritability , and he did not like it .
what he particularly disliked was that golenishtchev , a man belonging to a good set , should put himself on a level with some scribbling fellows , with whom he was irritated and angry .
was it worth it ?
vronsky disliked it , yet he felt that golenishtchev was unhappy , and was sorry for him .
unhappiness , almost mental derangement , was visible on his mobile , rather handsome face , while without even noticing anna s coming in , he went on hurriedly and hotly expressing his views .
when anna came in in her hat and cape , and her lovely hand rapidly swinging her parasol , and stood beside him , it was with a feeling of relief that vronsky broke away from the plaintive eyes of golenishtchev which fastened persistently upon him , and with a fresh rush of love looked at his charming companion , full of life and happiness .
golenishtchev recovered himself with an effort , and at first was dejected and gloomy , but anna , disposed to feel friendly with everyone as she was at that time , soon revived his spirits by her direct and lively manner .
after trying various subjects of conversation , she got him upon painting , of which he talked very well , and she listened to him attentively .
they walked to the house they had taken , and looked over it .
i am very glad of one thing , said anna to golenishtchev when they were on their way back , alexey will have a capital .
you must certainly take that room , she said to vronsky in russian , using the affectionately familiar form as though she saw that golenishtchev would become intimate with them in their isolation , and that there was no need of reserve before him .
do you paint ?
said golenishtchev , turning round quickly to vronsky .
yes , i used to study long ago , and now i have begun to do a little , said vronsky , reddening .
he has great talent , said anna with a delighted smile .
i m no judge , of course .
but good judges have said the same .
anna , in that first period of her emancipation and rapid return to health , felt herself unpardonably happy and full of the joy of life .
the thought of her husband s unhappiness did not poison her happiness .
on one side that memory was too awful to be thought of .
on the other side her husband s unhappiness had given her too much happiness to be regretted .
the memory of all that had happened after her illness her reconciliation with her husband , its breakdown , the news of vronsky s wound , his visit , the preparations for divorce , the departure from her husband s house , the parting from her that seemed to her like a delirious dream , from which she had waked up alone with vronsky abroad .
the thought of the harm caused to her husband aroused in her a feeling like repulsion , and akin to what a drowning man might feel who has shaken off another man clinging to him .
that man did drown .
it was an evil action , of course , but it was the sole means of escape , and better not to brood over these fearful facts .
one consolatory reflection upon her conduct had occurred to her at the first moment of the final rupture , and when now she recalled all the past , she remembered that one reflection .
i have inevitably made that man wretched , she thought ; but i don t want to profit by his misery .
i too am suffering , and shall suffer ; i am losing what i prized above am losing my good name and my son .
i have done wrong , and so i don t want happiness , i don t want a divorce , and shall suffer from my shame and the separation from my child .
but , however sincerely anna had meant to suffer , she was not suffering .
shame there was not .
with the tact of which both had such a large share , they had succeeded in avoiding russian ladies abroad , and so had never placed themselves in a false position , and everywhere they had met people who pretended that they perfectly understood their position , far better indeed than they did themselves .
separation from the son she that did not cause her anguish in these early days .
the baby so sweet , and had so won anna s heart , since she was all that was left her , that anna rarely thought of her son .
the desire for life , waxing stronger with recovered health , was so intense , and the conditions of life were so new and pleasant , that anna felt unpardonably happy .
the more she got to know vronsky , the more she loved him .
she loved him for himself , and for his love for her .
her complete ownership of him was a continual joy to her .
his presence was always sweet to her .
all the traits of his character , which she learned to know better and better , were unutterably dear to her .
his appearance , changed by his civilian dress , was as fascinating to her as though she were some young girl in love .
in everything he said , thought , and did , she saw something particularly noble and elevated .
her adoration of him alarmed her indeed ; she sought and could not find in him anything not fine .
she dared not show him her sense of her own insignificance beside him .
it seemed to her that , knowing this , he might sooner cease to love her ; and she dreaded nothing now so much as losing his love , though she had no grounds for fearing it .
but she could not help being grateful to him for his attitude to her , and showing that she appreciated it .
he , who had in her opinion such a marked aptitude for a political career , in which he would have been certain to play a leading had sacrificed his ambition for her sake , and never betrayed the slightest regret .
he was more lovingly respectful to her than ever , and the constant care that she should not feel the awkwardness of her position never deserted him for a single instant .
he , so manly a man , never opposed her , had indeed , with her , no will of his own , and was anxious , it seemed , for nothing but to anticipate her wishes .
and she could not but appreciate this , even though the very intensity of his solicitude for her , the atmosphere of care with which he surrounded her , sometimes weighed upon her .
vronsky , meanwhile , in spite of the complete realization of what he had so long desired , was not perfectly happy .
he soon felt that the realization of his desires gave him no more than a grain of sand out of the mountain of happiness he had expected .
it showed him the mistake men make in picturing to themselves happiness as the realization of their desires .
for a time after joining his life to hers , and putting on civilian dress , he had felt all the delight of freedom in general of which he had known nothing before , and of freedom in his love , he was content , but not for long .
he was soon aware that there was springing up in his heart a desire for .
without conscious intention he began to clutch at every passing caprice , taking it for a desire and an object .
sixteen hours of the day must be occupied in some way , since they were living abroad in complete freedom , outside the conditions of social life which filled up time in petersburg .
as for the amusements of bachelor existence , which had provided vronsky with entertainment on previous tours abroad , they could not be thought of , since the sole attempt of the sort had led to a sudden attack of depression in anna , quite out of proportion with the late supper with bachelor friends .
relations with the society of the and equally out of the question owing to the irregularity of their position .
the inspection of objects of interest , apart from the fact that everything had been seen already , had not for vronsky , a russian and a sensible man , the immense significance englishmen are able to attach to that pursuit .
and just as the hungry stomach eagerly accepts every object it can get , hoping to find nourishment in it , vronsky quite unconsciously clutched first at politics , then at new books , and then at pictures .
as he had from a child a taste for painting , and as , not knowing what to spend his money on , he had begun collecting engravings , he came to a stop at painting , began to take interest in it , and concentrated upon it the unoccupied mass of desires which demanded satisfaction .
he had a ready appreciation of art , and probably , with a taste for imitating art , he supposed himself to have the real thing essential for an artist , and after hesitating for some time which style of painting to , historical , realistic , or genre set to work to paint .
he appreciated all kinds , and could have felt inspired by any one of them ; but he had no conception of the possibility of knowing nothing at all of any school of painting , and of being inspired directly by what is within the soul , without caring whether what is painted will belong to any recognized school .
since he knew nothing of this , and drew his inspiration , not directly from life , but indirectly from life embodied in art , his inspiration came very quickly and easily , and as quickly and easily came his success in painting something very similar to the sort of painting he was trying to imitate .
more than any other style he liked the and in that style he began to paint anna s portrait in italian costume , and the portrait seemed to him , and to everyone who saw it , extremely successful .
the old neglected palazzo , with its lofty carved ceilings and frescoes on the walls , with its floors of mosaic , with its heavy yellow stuff curtains on the windows , with its vases on pedestals , and its open fireplaces , its carved doors and gloomy reception rooms , hung with palazzo did much , by its very appearance after they had moved into it , to confirm in vronsky the agreeable illusion that he was not so much a russian country gentleman , a retired army officer , as an enlightened amateur and patron of the arts , himself a modest artist who had renounced the world , his connections , and his ambition for the sake of the woman he loved .
the pose chosen by vronsky with their removal into the palazzo was completely successful , and having , through golenishtchev , made acquaintance with a few interesting people , for a time he was satisfied .
he painted studies from nature under the guidance of an italian professor of painting , and studied mediaeval italian life .
mediaeval italian life so fascinated vronsky that he even wore a hat and flung a cloak over his shoulder in the mediaeval style , which , indeed , was extremely becoming to him .
here we live , and know nothing of what s going on , vronsky said to golenishtchev as he came to see him one morning .
have you seen mihailov s picture ?
he said , handing him a russian gazette he had received that morning , and pointing to an article on a russian artist , living in the very same town , and just finishing a picture which had long been talked about , and had been bought beforehand .
the article reproached the government and the academy for letting so remarkable an artist be left without encouragement and support .
i ve seen it , answered golenishtchev .
of course , he s not without talent , but it s all in a wrong direction .
it s all the attitude to christ and to religious painting .
what is the subject of the picture ?
asked anna .
christ before pilate .
christ is represented as a jew with all the realism of the new school .
and the question of the subject of the picture having brought him to one of his favorite theories , golenishtchev launched forth into a disquisition on it .
i can t understand how they can fall into such a gross mistake .
christ always has his definite embodiment in the art of the great masters .
and therefore , if they want to depict , not god , but a revolutionist or a sage , let them take from history a socrates , a franklin , a charlotte corday , but not christ .
they take the very figure which can not be taken for their art , and then and is it true that this mihailov is in such poverty ?
asked vronsky , thinking that , as a russian maecenas , it was his duty to assist the artist regardless of whether the picture were good or bad .
i should say not .
he s a remarkable .
have you ever seen his portrait of madame vassiltchikova ?
but i believe he doesn t care about painting any more portraits , and so very likely he is in want .
i maintain that couldn t we ask him to paint a portrait of anna arkadyevna ?
said vronsky .
why mine ?
said anna .
after yours i don t want another portrait .
better have one of annie ( so she called her baby girl ) .
here she is , she added , looking out of the window at the handsome italian nurse , who was carrying the child out into the garden , and immediately glancing unnoticed at vronsky .
the handsome nurse , from whom vronsky was painting a head for his picture , was the one hidden grief in anna s life .
he painted with her as his model , admired her beauty and mediaevalism , and anna dared not confess to herself that she was afraid of becoming jealous of this nurse , and was for that reason particularly gracious and condescending both to her and her little son .
vronsky , too , glanced out of the window and into anna s eyes , and , turning at once to golenishtchev , he said do you know this mihailov ?
i have met him .
but he s a queer fish , and quite without breeding .
you know , one of those uncouth new people one s so often coming across nowadays , one of those you know , who are reared in theories of atheism , scepticism , and materialism .
in former days , said golenishtchev , not observing , or not willing to observe , that both anna and vronsky wanted to speak , in former days the was a man who had been brought up in ideas of religion , law , and morality , and only through conflict and struggle came to ; but now there has sprung up a new type of born who grow up without even having heard of principles of morality or of religion , of the existence of authorities , who grow up directly in ideas of negation in everything , that is to say , savages .
well , he s of that class .
he s the son , it appears , of some moscow butler , and has never had any sort of .
when he got into the academy and made his reputation he tried , as he s no fool , to educate himself .
and he turned to what seemed to him the very source of magazines .
in old times , you see , a man who wanted to educate frenchman , for have set to work to study all the classics and theologians and tragedians and historiaris and philosophers , and , you know , all the intellectual work that came in his way .
but in our day he goes straight for the literature of negation , very quickly assimilates all the extracts of the science of negation , and he s ready .
and that s not years ago he would have found in that literature traces of conflict with authorities , with the creeds of the ages ; he would have perceived from this conflict that there was something else ; but now he comes at once upon a literature in which the old creeds do not even furnish matter for discussion , but it is stated baldly that there is nothing , natural selection , struggle for that s all .
in my article i ve i tell you what , said anna , who had for a long while been exchanging wary glances with vronsky , and knew that he was not in the least interested in the education of this artist , but was simply absorbed by the idea of assisting him , and ordering a portrait of him ; i tell you what , she said , resolutely interrupting golenishtchev , who was still talking away , let s go and see him !
golenishtchev recovered his and readily agreed .
but as the artist lived in a remote suburb , it was decided to take the carriage .
an hour later anna , with golenishtchev by her side and vronsky on the front seat of the carriage , facing them , drove up to a new ugly house in the remote suburb .
on learning from the porter s wife , who came out to them , that mihailov saw visitors at his studio , but that at that moment he was in his lodging only a couple of steps off , they sent her to him with their cards , asking permission to see his picture .
the artist mihailov was , as always , at work when the cards of count vronsky and golenishtchev were brought to him .
in the morning he had been working in his studio at his big picture .
on getting home he flew into a rage with his wife for not having managed to put off the landlady , who had been asking for money .
i ve said it to you twenty times , don t enter into details .
you re fool enough at all times , and when you start explaining things in italian you re a fool three times as foolish , he said after a long dispute .
don t let it run so long ; it s not my fault .
if i had the money leave me in peace , for god s sake !
mihailov shrieked , with tears in his voice , and , stopping his ears , he went off into his working room , the other side of a partition wall , and closed the door after him .
idiotic woman !
he said to himself , sat down to the table , and , opening a portfolio , he set to work at once with peculiar fervor at a sketch he had begun .
never did he work with such fervor and success as when things went ill with him , and especially when he quarreled with his wife .
oh !
damn them all !
he thought as he went on working .
he was making a sketch for the figure of a man in a violent rage .
a sketch had been made before , but he was dissatisfied with it .
no , that one was better where is it ?
he went back to his wife , and scowling , and not looking at her , asked his eldest little girl , where was that piece of paper he had given them ?
the paper with the discarded sketch on it was found , but it was dirty , and spotted with .
still , he took the sketch , laid it on his table , and , moving a little away , screwing up his eyes , he fell to gazing at it .
all at once he smiled and gesticulated gleefully .
that s it !
that s it !
he said , and , at once picking up the pencil , he began rapidly drawing .
the spot of tallow had given the man a new pose .
he had sketched this new pose , when all at once he recalled the face of a shopkeeper of whom he had bought cigars , a vigorous face with a prominent chin , and he sketched this very face , this chin on to the figure of the man .
he laughed aloud with delight .
the figure from a lifeless imagined thing had become living , and such that it could never be changed .
that figure lived , and was clearly and unmistakably defined .
the sketch might be corrected in accordance with the requirements of the figure , the legs , indeed , could and must be put differently , and the position of the left hand must be quite altered ; the hair too might be thrown back .
but in making these corrections he was not altering the figure but simply getting rid of what concealed the figure .
he was , as it were , stripping off the wrappings which hindered it from being distinctly seen .
each new feature only brought out the whole figure in all its force and vigor , as it had suddenly come to him from the spot of tallow .
he was carefully finishing the figure when the cards were brought him .
coming , coming !
he went in to his wife .
come , sasha , don t be cross !
he said , smiling timidly and affectionately at her .
you were to blame .
i was to blame .
i ll make it all right .
and having made peace with his wife he put on an overcoat with a velvet collar and a hat , and went towards his studio .
the successful figure he had already forgotten .
now he was delighted and excited at the visit of these people of consequence , russians , who had come in their carriage .
of his picture , the one that stood now on his easel , he had at the bottom of his heart one no one had ever painted a picture like it .
he did not believe that his picture was better than all the pictures of raphael , but he knew that what he tried to convey in that picture , no one ever had conveyed .
this he knew positively , and had known a long while , ever since he had begun to paint it .
but other people s criticisms , whatever they might be , had yet immense consequence in his eyes , and they agitated him to the depths of his soul .
any remark , the most insignificant , that showed that the critic saw even the tiniest part of what he saw in the picture , agitated him to the depths of his soul .
he always attributed to his critics a more profound comprehension than he had himself , and always expected from them something he did not himself see in the picture .
and often in their criticisms he fancied that he had found this .
he walked rapidly to the door of his studio , and in spite of his excitement he was struck by the soft light on anna s figure as she stood in the shade of the entrance listening to golenishtchev , who was eagerly telling her something , while she evidently wanted to look round at the artist .
he was himself unconscious how , as he approached them , he seized on this impression and absorbed it , as he had the chin of the shopkeeper who had sold him the cigars , and put it away somewhere to be brought out when he wanted it .
the visitors , not agreeably impressed beforehand by golenishtchev s account of the artist , were still less so by his personal appearance .
and of middle height , with nimble movements , with his brown hat , coat and narrow wide trousers had been a long while in fashion , of all , with the ordinariness of his broad face , and the combined expression of timidity and anxiety to keep up his dignity , mihailov made an unpleasant impression .
please step in , he said , trying to look indifferent , and going into the passage he took a key out of his pocket and opened the door .
on entering the studio , mihailov once more scanned his visitors and noted down in his imagination vronsky s expression too , and especially his jaws .
although his artistic sense was unceasingly at work collecting materials , although he felt a continually increasing excitement as the moment of criticizing his work drew nearer , he rapidly and subtly formed , from imperceptible signs , a mental image of these three persons .
that fellow ( golenishtchev ) was a russian living here .
mihailov did not remember his surname nor where he had met him , nor what he had said to him .
he only remembered his face as he remembered all the faces he had ever seen ; but he remembered , too , that it was one of the faces laid by in his memory in the immense class of the falsely consequential and poor in expression .
the abundant hair and very open forehead gave an appearance of consequence to the face , which had only one petty , childish , peevish expression , concentrated just above the bridge of the narrow nose .
vronsky and madame karenina must be , mihailov supposed , distinguished and wealthy russians , knowing nothing about art , like all those wealthy russians , but posing as amateurs and connoisseurs .
most likely they ve already looked at all the antiques , and now they re making the round of the studios of the new people , the german humbug , and the cracked english fellow , and have only come to me to make the point of view complete , he thought .
he was well acquainted with the way dilettanti have ( the cleverer they were the worse he found them ) of looking at the works of contemporary artists with the sole object of being in a position to say that art is a thing of the past , and that the more one sees of the new men the more one sees how inimitable the works of the great old masters have remained .
he expected all this ; he saw it all in their faces , he saw it in the careless indifference with which they talked among themselves , stared at the lay figures and busts , and walked about in leisurely fashion , waiting for him to uncover his picture .
but in spite of this , while he was turning over his studies , pulling up the blinds and taking off the sheet , he was in intense excitement , especially as , in spite of his conviction that all distinguished and wealthy russians were certain to be beasts and fools , he liked vronsky , and still more anna .
here , if you please , he said , moving on one side with his nimble gait and pointing to his picture , it s the exhortation to pilate .
matthew , chapter xxvii , he said , feeling his lips were beginning to tremble with emotion .
he moved away and stood behind them .
for the few seconds during which the visitors were gazing at the picture in silence mihailov too gazed at it with the indifferent eye of an outsider .
for those few seconds he was sure in anticipation that a higher , juster criticism would be uttered by them , by those very visitors whom he had been so despising a moment before .
he forgot all he had thought about his picture before during the three years he had been painting it ; he forgot all its qualities which had been absolutely certain to saw the picture with their indifferent , new , outside eyes , and saw nothing good in it .
he saw in the foreground pilate s irritated face and the serene face of christ , and in the background the figures of pilate s retinue and the face of john watching what was happening .
every face that , with such agony , such blunders and corrections had grown up within him with its special character , every face that had given him such torments and such raptures , and all these faces so many times transposed for the sake of the harmony of the whole , all the shades of color and tones that he had attained with such of this together seemed to him now , looking at it with their eyes , the merest vulgarity , something that had been done a thousand times over .
the face dearest to him , the face of christ , the center of the picture , which had given him such ecstasy as it unfolded itself to him , was utterly lost to him when he glanced at the picture with their eyes .
he saw a ( no , not even distinctly saw now a mass of defects ) repetition of those endless christs of titian , raphael , rubens , and the same soldiers and pilate .
it was all common , poor , and stale , and positively badly and unequal .
they would be justified in repeating hypocritically civil speeches in the presence of the painter , and pitying him and laughing at him when they were alone again .
the silence ( though it lasted no more than a minute ) became too intolerable to him .
to break it , and to show he was not agitated , he made an effort and addressed golenishtchev .
i think i ve had the pleasure of meeting you , he said , looking uneasily first at anna , then at vronsky , in fear of losing any shade of their expression .
to be sure !
we met at rossi s , do you remember , at that when that italian lady new rachel ?
golenishtchev answered easily , removing his eyes without the slightest regret from the picture and turning to the artist .
noticing , however , that mihailov was expecting a criticism of the picture , he said your picture has got on a great deal since i saw it last time ; and what strikes me particularly now , as it did then , is the figure of pilate .
one so knows the man a , capital fellow , but an official through and through , who does not know what it is he s doing .
but i fancy all mihailov s mobile face beamed at once ; his eyes sparkled .
he tried to say something , but he could not speak for excitement , and pretended to be coughing .
low as was his opinion of golenishtchev s capacity for understanding art , trifling as was the true remark upon the fidelity of the expression of pilate as an official , and offensive as might have seemed the utterance of so unimportant an observation while nothing was said of more serious points , mihailov was in an ecstasy of delight at this observation .
he had himself thought about pilate s figure just what golenishtchev said .
the fact that this reflection was but one of millions of reflections , which as mihailov knew for certain would be true , did not diminish for him the significance of golenishtchev s remark .
his heart warmed to golenishtchev for this remark , and from a state of depression he suddenly passed to ecstasy .
at once the whole of his picture lived before him in all the indescribable complexity of everything living .
mihailov again tried to say that that was how he understood pilate , but his lips quivered intractably , and he could not pronounce the words .
vronsky and anna too said something in that subdued voice in which , partly to avoid hurting the artist s feelings and partly to avoid saying out loud something easily said when talking of usually speak at exhibitions of pictures .
mihailov fancied that the picture had made an impression on them too .
he went up to them .
how marvelous christ s expression is !
said anna .
of all she saw she liked that expression most of all , and she felt that it was the center of the picture , and so praise of it would be pleasant to the artist .
one can see that he is pitying pilate .
this again was one of the million true reflections that could be found in his picture and in the figure of christ .
she said that he was pitying pilate .
in christ s expression there ought to be indeed an expression of pity , since there is an expression of love , of heavenly peace , of readiness for death , and a sense of the vanity of words .
of course there is the expression of an official in pilate and of pity in christ , seeing that one is the incarnation of the fleshly and the other of the spiritual life .
all this and much more flashed into mihailov s thoughts .
yes , and how that figure is atmosphere !
one can walk round it , said golenishtchev , unmistakably betraying by this remark that he did not approve of the meaning and idea of the figure .
yes , there s a wonderful mastery !
said vronsky .
how those figures in the background stand out !
there you have technique , he said , addressing golenishtchev , alluding to a conversation between them about vronsky s despair of attaining this technique .
yes , yes , marvelous !
golenishtchev and anna assented .
in spite of the excited condition in which he was , the sentence about technique had sent a pang to mihailov s heart , and looking angrily at vronsky he suddenly scowled .
he had often heard this word technique , and was utterly unable to understand what was understood by it .
he knew that by this term was understood a mechanical facility for painting or drawing , entirely apart from its subject .
he had noticed often that even in actual praise technique was opposed to essential quality , as though one could paint well something that was bad .
he knew that a great deal of attention and care was necessary in taking off the coverings , to avoid injuring the creation itself , and to take off all the coverings ; but there was no art of technique of any it .
if to a little child or to his cook were revealed what he saw , it or she would have been able to peel the wrappings off what was seen .
and the most experienced and adroit painter could not by mere mechanical facility paint anything if the lines of the subject were not revealed to him first .
besides , he saw that if it came to talking about technique , it was impossible to praise him for it .
in all he had painted and repainted he saw faults that hurt his eyes , coming from want of care in taking off the he could not correct now without spoiling the whole .
and in almost all the figures and faces he saw , too , remnants of the wrappings not perfectly removed that spoiled the picture .
one thing might be said , if you will allow me to make the remark observed golenishtchev .
oh , i shall be delighted , i beg you , said mihailov with a forced smile .
that is , that you make him the , and not the .
but i know that was what you meant to do .
i can not paint a christ that is not in my heart , said mihailov gloomily .
yes ; but in that case , if you will allow me to say what i think
your picture is so fine that my observation can not detract from it , and , besides , it is only my personal opinion .
with you it is different .
your very motive is different .
but let us take ivanov .
i imagine that if christ is brought down to the level of an historical character , it would have been better for ivanov to select some other historical subject , fresh , untouched .
but if this is the greatest subject presented to art ?
if one looked one would find others .
but the point is that art can not suffer doubt and discussion .
and before the picture of ivanov the question arises for the believer and the unbeliever alike , is it god , or is it not god ? and the unity of the impression is destroyed .
why so ?
i think that for educated people , said mihailov , the question can not exist .
golenishtchev did not agree with this , and confounded mihailov by his support of his first idea of the unity of the impression being essential to art .
mihailov was greatly perturbed , but he could say nothing in defense of his own idea .
anna and vronsky had long been exchanging glances , regretting their friend s flow of cleverness .
at last vronsky , without waiting for the artist , walked away to another small picture .
oh , how exquisite !
what a lovely thing !
a gem !
how exquisite !
they cried with one voice .
what is it they re so pleased with ?
thought mihailov .
he had positively forgotten that picture he had painted three years ago .
he had forgotten all the agonies and the ecstasies he had lived through with that picture when for several months it had been the one thought haunting him day and night .
he had forgotten , as he always forgot , the pictures he had finished .
he did not even like to look at it , and had only brought it out because he was expecting an englishman who wanted to buy it .
oh , that s only an old study , he said .
how fine !
said golenishtchev , he too , with unmistakable sincerity , falling under the spell of the picture .
two boys were angling in the shade of a .
the elder had just dropped in the hook , and was carefully pulling the float from behind a bush , entirely absorbed in what he was doing .
the other , a little younger , was lying in the grass leaning on his elbows , with his tangled , flaxen head in his hands , staring at the water with his dreamy blue eyes .
what was he thinking of ?
the enthusiasm over this picture stirred some of the old feeling for it in mihailov , but he feared and disliked this waste of feeling for things past , and so , even though this praise was grateful to him , he tried to draw his visitors away to a third picture .
but vronsky asked whether the picture was for sale .
to mihailov at that moment , excited by visitors , it was extremely distasteful to speak of money matters .
it is put up there to be sold , he answered , scowling gloomily .
when the visitors had gone , mihailov sat down opposite the picture of pilate and christ , and in his mind went over what had been said , and what , though not said , had been implied by those visitors .
and , strange to say , what had had such weight with him , while they were there and while he mentally put himself at their point of view , suddenly lost all importance for him .
he began to look at his picture with all his own full artist vision , and was soon in that mood of conviction of the perfectibility , and so of the significance , of his conviction essential to the most intense fervor , excluding all other which alone he could work .
christ s foreshortened leg was not right , though .
he took his palette and began to work .
as he corrected the leg he looked continually at the figure of john in the background , which his visitors had not even noticed , but which he knew was beyond perfection .
when he had finished the leg he wanted to touch that figure , but he felt too much excited for it .
he was equally unable to work when he was cold and when he was too much affected and saw everything too much .
there was only one stage in the transition from coldness to inspiration , at which work was possible .
today he was too much agitated .
he would have covered the picture , but he stopped , holding the cloth in his hand , and , smiling blissfully , gazed a long while at the figure of john .
at last , as it were regretfully tearing himself away , he dropped the cloth , and , exhausted but happy , went home .
vronsky , anna , and golenishtchev , on their way home , were particularly lively and cheerful .
they talked of mihailov and his pictures .
the word , by which they meant an inborn , almost physical , aptitude apart from brain and heart , and in which they tried to find an expression for all the artist had gained from life , recurred particularly often in their talk , as though it were necessary for them to sum up what they had no conception of , though they wanted to talk of it .
they said that there was no denying his talent , but that his talent could not develop for want of common defect of our russian artists .
but the picture of the boys had imprinted itself on their memories , and they were continually coming back to it .
what an exquisite thing !
how he has succeeded in it , and how simply !
he doesn t even comprehend how good it is .
yes , i mustn t let it slip ; i must buy it , said vronsky .
mihailov sold vronsky his picture , and agreed to paint a portrait of anna .
on the day fixed he came and began the work .
from the fifth sitting the portrait impressed everyone , especially vronsky , not only by its resemblance , but by its characteristic beauty .
it was strange how mihailov could have discovered just her characteristic beauty .
one needs to know and love her as i have loved her to discover the very sweetest expression of her soul , vronsky thought , though it was only from this portrait that he had himself learned this sweetest expression of her soul .
but the expression was so true that he , and others too , fancied they had long known it .
i have been struggling on for ever so long without doing anything , he said of his own portrait of her , and he just looked and painted it .
that s where technique comes in .
that will come , was the consoling reassurance given him by golenishtchev , in whose view vronsky had both talent , and what was most important , culture , giving him a wider outlook on art .
golenishtchev s faith in vronsky s talent was propped up by his own need of vronsky s sympathy and approval for his own articles and ideas , and he felt that the praise and support must be mutual .
in another man s house , and especially in vronsky s palazzo , mihailov was quite a different man from what he was in his studio .
he behaved with hostile courtesy , as though he were afraid of coming closer to people he did not respect .
he called vronsky your excellency , and notwithstanding anna s and vronsky s invitations , he would never stay to dinner , nor come except for the sittings .
anna was even more friendly to him than to other people , and was very grateful for her portrait .
vronsky was more than cordial with him , and was obviously interested to know the artist s opinion of his picture .
golenishtchev never let slip an opportunity of instilling sound ideas about art into mihailov .
but mihailov remained equally chilly to all of them .
anna was aware from his eyes that he liked looking at her , but he avoided conversation with her .
vronsky s talk about his painting he met with stubborn silence , and he was as stubbornly silent when he was shown vronsky s picture .
he was unmistakably bored by golenishtchev s conversation , and he did not attempt to oppose him .
altogether mihailov , with his reserved and disagreeable , as it were , hostile attitude , was quite disliked by them as they got to know him better ; and they were glad when the sittings were over , and they were left with a magnificent portrait in their possession , and he gave up coming .
golenishtchev was the first to give expression to an idea that had occurred to all of them , which was that mihailov was simply jealous of vronsky .
not envious , let us say , since he has ; but it annoys him that a wealthy man of the highest society , and a count , too ( you know they all detest a title ) , can , without any particular trouble , do as well , if not better , than he who has devoted all his life to it .
and more than all , it s a question of culture , which he is without .
vronsky defended mihailov , but at the bottom of his heart he believed it , because in his view a man of a different , lower world would be sure to be envious .
anna s same subject painted from nature both by him and by to have shown vronsky the difference between him and mihailov ; but he did not see it .
only after mihailov s portrait was painted he left off painting his portrait of anna , deciding that it was now not needed .
his picture of mediaeval life he went on with .
and he himself , and golenishtchev , and still more anna , thought it very good , because it was far more like the celebrated pictures they knew than mihailov s picture .
mihailov meanwhile , although anna s portrait greatly fascinated him , was even more glad than they were when the sittings were over , and he had no longer to listen to golenishtchev s disquisitions upon art , and could forget about vronsky s painting .
he knew that vronsky could not be prevented from amusing himself with painting ; he knew that he and all dilettanti had a perfect right to paint what they liked , but it was distasteful to him .
a man could not be prevented from making himself a big wax doll , and kissing it .
but if the man were to come with the doll and sit before a man in love , and begin caressing his doll as the lover caressed the woman he loved , it would be distasteful to the lover .
just such a distasteful sensation was what mihailov felt at the sight of vronsky s painting he felt it both ludicrous and irritating , both pitiable and offensive .
vronsky s interest in painting and the middle ages did not last long .
he had enough taste for painting to be unable to finish his picture .
the picture came to a standstill .
he was vaguely aware that its defects , inconspicuous at first , would be glaring if he were to go on with it .
the same experience befell him as golenishtchev , who felt that he had nothing to say , and continually deceived himself with the theory that his idea was not yet mature , that he was working it out and collecting materials .
this exasperated and tortured golenishtchev , but vronsky was incapable of deceiving and torturing himself , and even more incapable of exasperation .
with his characteristic decision , without explanation or apology , he simply ceased working at painting .
but without this occupation , the life of vronsky and of anna , who wondered at his loss of interest in it , struck them as intolerably tedious in an italian town .
the palazzo suddenly seemed so obtrusively old and dirty , the spots on the curtains , the cracks in the floors , the broken plaster on the cornices became so disagreeably obvious , and the everlasting sameness of golenishtchev , and the italian professor and the german traveler became so wearisome , that they had to make some change .
they resolved to go to russia , to the country .
in petersburg vronsky intended to arrange a partition of the land with his brother , while anna meant to see her son .
the summer they intended to spend on vronsky s great family estate .
levin had been married three months .
he was happy , but not at all in the way he had expected to be .
at every step he found his former dreams disappointed , and new , unexpected surprises of happiness .
he was happy ; but on entering upon family life he saw at every step that it was utterly different from what he had imagined .
at every step he experienced what a man would experience who , after admiring the smooth , happy course of a little boat on a lake , should get himself into that little boat .
he saw that it was not all sitting still , floating smoothly ; that one had to think too , not for an instant to forget where one was floating ; and that there was water under one , and that one must row ; and that his unaccustomed hands would be sore ; and that it was only to look at it that was easy ; but that doing it , though very delightful , was very difficult .
as a bachelor , when he had watched other people s married life , seen the petty cares , the squabbles , the jealousy , he had only smiled contemptuously in his heart .
in his future married life there could be , he was convinced , nothing of that sort ; even the external forms , indeed , he fancied , must be utterly unlike the life of others in everything .
and all of a sudden , instead of his life with his wife being made on an individual pattern , it was , on the contrary , entirely made up of the pettiest details , which he had so despised before , but which now , by no will of his own , had gained an extraordinary importance that it was useless to contend against .
and levin saw that the organization of all these details was by no means so easy as he had fancied before .
although levin believed himself to have the most exact conceptions of domestic life , unconsciously , like all men , he pictured domestic life as the happiest enjoyment of love , with nothing to hinder and no petty cares to distract .
he ought , as he conceived the position , to do his work , and to find repose from it in the happiness of love .
she ought to be beloved , and nothing more .
but , like all men , he forgot that she too would want work .
and he was surprised that she , his poetic , exquisite kitty , could , not merely in the first weeks , but even in the first days of their married life , think , remember , and busy herself about tablecloths , and furniture , about mattresses for visitors , about a tray , about the cook , and the dinner , and so on .
while they were still engaged , he had been struck by the definiteness with which she had declined the tour abroad and decided to go into the country , as though she knew of something she wanted , and could still think of something outside her love .
this had jarred upon him then , and now her trivial cares and anxieties jarred upon him several times .
but he saw that this was essential for her .
and , loving her as he did , though he did not understand the reason of them , and jeered at these domestic pursuits , he could not help admiring them .
he jeered at the way in which she arranged the furniture they had brought from moscow ; rearranged their room ; hung up curtains ; prepared rooms for visitors ; a room for dolly ; saw after an abode for her new maid ; ordered dinner of the old cook ; came into collision with agafea mihalovna , taking from her the charge of the stores .
he saw how the old cook smiled , admiring her , and listening to her inexperienced , impossible orders , how mournfully and tenderly agafea mihalovna shook her head over the young mistress s new arrangements .
he saw that kitty was extraordinarily sweet when , laughing and crying , she came to tell him that her maid , masha , was used to looking upon her as her young lady , and so no one obeyed her .
it seemed to him sweet , but strange , and he thought it would have been better without this .
he did not know how great a sense of change she was experiencing ; she , who at home had sometimes wanted some favorite dish , or sweets , without the possibility of getting either , now could order what she liked , buy pounds of sweets , spend as much money as she liked , and order any puddings she pleased .
she was dreaming with delight now of dolly s coming to them with her children , especially because she would order for the children their favorite puddings and dolly would appreciate all her new housekeeping .
she did not know herself why and wherefore , but the arranging of her house had an irresistible attraction for her .
instinctively feeling the approach of spring , and knowing that there would be days of rough weather too , she built her nest as best she could , and was in haste at the same time to build it and to learn how to do it .
this care for domestic details in kitty , so opposed to levin s ideal of exalted happiness , was at first one of the disappointments ; and this sweet care of her household , the aim of which he did not understand , but could not help loving , was one of the new happy surprises .
another disappointment and happy surprise came in their quarrels .
levin could never have conceived that between him and his wife any relations could arise other than tender , respectful and loving , and all at once in the very early days they quarreled , so that she said he did not care for her , that he cared for no one but himself , burst into tears , and wrung her arms .
this first quarrel arose from levin s having gone out to a new farmhouse and having been away half an hour too long , because he had tried to get home by a short cut and had lost his way .
he drove home thinking of nothing but her , of her love , of his own happiness , and the nearer he drew to home , the warmer was his tenderness for her .
he ran into the room with the same feeling , with an even stronger feeling than he had had when he reached the shtcherbatskys house to make his offer .
and suddenly he was met by a lowering expression he had never seen in her .
he would have kissed her ; she pushed him away .
what is it ?
you ve been enjoying yourself , she began , trying to be calm and spiteful .
but as soon as she opened her mouth , a stream of reproach , of senseless jealousy , of all that had been torturing her during that half hour which she had spent sitting motionless at the window , burst from her .
it was only then , for the first time , that he clearly understood what he had not understood when he led her out of the church after the wedding .
he felt now that he was not simply close to her , but that he did not know where he ended and she began .
he felt this from the agonizing sensation of division that he experienced at that instant .
he was offended for the first instant , but the very same second he felt that he could not be offended by her , that she was himself .
he felt for the first moment as a man feels when , having suddenly received a violent blow from behind , he turns round , angry and eager to avenge himself , to look for his antagonist , and finds that it is he himself who has accidentally struck himself , that there is no one to be angry with , and that he must put up with and try to soothe the pain .
never afterwards did he feel it with such intensity , but this first time he could not for a long while get over it .
his natural feeling urged him to defend himself , to prove to her she was wrong ; but to prove her wrong would mean irritating her still more and making the rupture greater that was the cause of all his suffering .
one habitual feeling impelled him to get rid of the blame and to pass it on to her .
another feeling , even stronger , impelled him as quickly as possible to smooth over the rupture without letting it grow greater .
to remain under such undeserved reproach was wretched , but to make her suffer by justifying himself was worse still .
like a man in an agony of pain , he wanted to tear out , to fling away the aching place , and coming to his senses , he felt that the aching place was himself .
he could do nothing but try to help the aching place to bear it , and this he tried to do .
they made peace .
she , recognizing that she was wrong , though she did not say so , became tenderer to him , and they experienced new , redoubled happiness in their love .
but that did not prevent such quarrels from happening again , and exceedingly often too , on the most unexpected and trivial grounds .
these quarrels frequently arose from the fact that they did not yet know what was of importance to each other and that all this early period they were both often in a bad temper .
when one was in a good temper , and the other in a bad temper , the peace was not broken ; but when both happened to be in an , quarrels sprang up from such incomprehensibly trifling causes , that they could never remember afterwards what they had quarreled about .
it is true that when they were both in a good temper their enjoyment of life was redoubled .
but still this first period of their married life was a difficult time for them .
during all this early time they had a peculiarly vivid sense of tension , as it were , a tugging in opposite directions of the chain by which they were bound .
altogether their is to say , the month after their which from tradition levin expected so much , was not merely not a time of sweetness , but remained in the memories of both as the bitterest and most humiliating period in their lives .
they both alike tried in later life to blot out from their memories all the monstrous , shameful incidents of that morbid period , when both were rarely in a normal frame of mind , both were rarely quite themselves .
it was only in the third month of their married life , after their return from moscow , where they had been staying for a month , that their life began to go more smoothly .
they had just come back from moscow , and were glad to be alone .
he was sitting at the writing table in his study , writing .
she , wearing the dark lilac dress she had worn during the first days of their married life , and put on again today , a dress particularly remembered and loved by him , was sitting on the sofa , the same leather sofa which had always stood in the study in levin s father s and grandfather s days .
she was sewing at .
he thought and wrote , never losing the happy consciousness of her presence .
his work , both on the land and on the book , in which the principles of the new land system were to be laid down , had not been abandoned ; but just as formerly these pursuits and ideas had seemed to him petty and trivial in comparison with the darkness that overspread all life , now they seemed as unimportant and petty in comparison with the life that lay before him suffused with the brilliant light of happiness .
he went on with his work , but he felt now that the center of gravity of his attention had passed to something else , and that consequently he looked at his work quite differently and more clearly .
formerly this work had been for him an escape from life .
formerly he had felt that without this work his life would be too gloomy .
now these pursuits were necessary for him that life might not be too uniformly bright .
taking up his manuscript , reading through what he had written , he found with pleasure that the work was worth his working at .
many of his old ideas seemed to him superfluous and extreme , but many blanks became distinct to him when he reviewed the whole thing in his memory .
he was writing now a new chapter on the causes of the present disastrous condition of agriculture in russia .
he maintained that the poverty of russia arises not merely from the anomalous distribution of landed property and misdirected reforms , but that what had contributed of late years to this result was the civilization from without abnormally grafted upon russia , especially facilities of communication , as railways , leading to centralization in towns , the development of luxury , and the consequent development of manufactures , credit and its accompaniment of to the detriment of agriculture .
it seemed to him that in a normal development of wealth in a state all these phenomena would arise only when a considerable amount of labor had been put into agriculture , when it had come under regular , or at least definite , conditions ; that the wealth of a country ought to increase proportionally , and especially in such a way that other sources of wealth should not outstrip agriculture ; that in harmony with a certain stage of agriculture there should be means of communication corresponding to it , and that in our unsettled condition of the land , railways , called into being by political and not by economic needs , were premature , and instead of promoting agriculture , as was expected of them , they were competing with agriculture and promoting the development of manufactures and credit , and so arresting its progress ; and that just as the and premature development of one organ in an animal would hinder its general development , so in the general development of wealth in russia , credit , facilities of communication , manufacturing activity , indubitably necessary in europe , where they had arisen in their proper time , had with us only done harm , by throwing into the background the chief question calling for question of the organization of agriculture .
while he was writing his ideas she was thinking how unnaturally cordial her husband had been to young prince tcharsky , who had , with great want of tact , flirted with her the day before they left moscow .
he s jealous , she thought .
goodness !
how sweet and silly he is !
he s jealous of me !
if he knew that i think no more of them than of piotr the cook , she thought , looking at his head and red neck with a feeling of possession strange to herself .
though it s a pity to take him from his work ( but he has plenty of time !
) , i must look at his face ; will he feel i m looking at him ?
i wish he d turn round i ll him to !
and she opened her eyes wide , as though to intensify the influence of her gaze .
yes , they draw away all the sap and give a false appearance of prosperity , he muttered , stopping to write , and , feeling that she was looking at him and smiling , he looked round .
well ?
he queried , smiling , and getting up .
he looked round , she thought .
it s nothing ; i wanted you to look round , she said , watching him , and trying to guess whether he was vexed at being interrupted or not .
how happy we are alone together ! am , that is , he said , going up to her with a radiant smile of happiness .
i m just as happy .
i ll never go anywhere , especially not to moscow .
and what were you thinking about ?
i ?
i was thinking no , no , go along , go on writing ; don t break off , she said , pursing up her lips , and i must cut out these little holes now , do you see ?
she took up her scissors and began cutting them out .
no ; tell me , what was it ?
he said , sitting down beside her and watching the tiny scissors moving round .
oh !
what was i thinking about ?
i was thinking about moscow , about the back of your head .
why should i , of all people , have such happiness !
it s unnatural , too good , he said , kissing her hand .
i feel quite the opposite ; the better things are , the more natural it seems to me .
and you ve got a little curl loose , he said , carefully turning her head round .
a little curl , oh yes .
no , no , we are busy at our work !
work did not progress further , and they darted apart from one another like culprits when kouzma came in to announce that tea was ready .
have they come from the town ?
levin asked kouzma .
they ve just come ; they re unpacking the things .
come quickly , she said to him as she went out of the study , or else i shall read your letters without you .
left alone , after putting his manuscripts together in the new portfolio bought by her , he washed his hands at the new washstand with the elegant fittings , that had all made their appearance with her .
levin smiled at his own thoughts , and shook his head disapprovingly at those thoughts ; a feeling akin to remorse fretted him .
there was something shameful , effeminate , capuan , as he called it to himself , in his present mode of life .
it s not right to go on like this , he thought .
it ll soon be three months , and i m doing next to nothing .
today , almost for the first time , i set to work seriously , and what happened ?
i did nothing but begin and throw it aside .
even my ordinary pursuits i have almost given up .
on the land i scarcely walk or drive about at all to look after things .
either i am loath to leave her , or i see she s dull alone .
and i used to think that , before marriage , life was nothing much , somehow didn t count , but that after marriage , life began in earnest .
and here almost three months have passed , and i have spent my time so idly and unprofitably .
no , this won t do ; i must begin .
of course , it s not her fault .
she s not to blame in any way .
i ought myself to be firmer , to maintain my masculine independence of action ; or else i shall get into such ways , and she ll get used to them too of course she s not to blame , he told himself .
but it is hard for anyone who is dissatisfied not to blame someone else , and especially the person nearest of all to him , for the ground of his dissatisfaction .
and it vaguely came into levin s mind that she herself was not to blame ( she could not be to blame for anything ) , but what was to blame was her education , too superficial and frivolous .
( that fool tcharsky she wanted , i know , to stop him , but didn t know how to . )
yes , apart from her interest in the house ( that she has ) , apart from dress and , she has no serious interests .
no interest in her work , in the estate , in the peasants , nor in music , though she s rather good at it , nor in reading .
she does nothing , and is perfectly satisfied .
levin , in his heart , censured this , and did not as yet understand that she was preparing for that period of activity which was to come for her when she would at once be the wife of her husband and mistress of the house , and would bear , and nurse , and bring up children .
he knew not that she was instinctively aware of this , and preparing herself for this time of terrible toil , did not reproach herself for the moments of carelessness and happiness in her love that she enjoyed now while gaily building her nest for the future .
when levin went upstairs , his wife was sitting near the new silver samovar behind the new tea service , and , having settled old agafea mihalovna at a little table with a full cup of tea , was reading a letter from dolly , with whom they were in continual and frequent correspondence .
you see , your good lady s settled me here , told me to sit a bit with her , said agafea mihalovna , smiling affectionately at kitty .
in these words of agafea mihalovna , levin read the final act of the drama which had been enacted of late between her and kitty .
he saw that , in spite of agafea mihalovna s feelings being hurt by a new mistress taking the reins of government out of her hands , kitty had yet conquered her and made her love her .
here , i opened your letter too , said kitty , handing him an illiterate letter .
it s from that woman , i think , your brother s she said .
i did not read it through .
this is from my people and from dolly .
fancy !
dolly took tanya and grisha to a children s ball at the sarmatskys tanya was a french marquise .
but levin did not hear her .
flushing , he took the letter from marya nikolaevna , his brother s former mistress , and began to read it .
this was the second letter he had received from marya nikolaevna .
in the first letter , marya nikolaevna wrote that his brother had sent her away for no fault of hers , and , with touching simplicity , added that though she was in want again , she asked for nothing , and wished for nothing , but was only tormented by the thought that nikolay dmitrievitch would come to grief without her , owing to the weak state of his health , and begged his brother to look after him .
now she wrote quite differently .
she had found nikolay dmitrievitch , had again made it up with him in moscow , and had moved with him to a provincial town , where he had received a post in the government service .
but that he had quarreled with the head official , and was on his way back to moscow , only he had been taken so ill on the road that it was doubtful if he would ever leave his bed again , she wrote .
it s always of you he has talked , and , besides , he has no more money left .
read this ; dolly writes about you , kitty was beginning , with a smile ; but she stopped suddenly , noticing the changed expression on her husband s face .
what is it ?
what s the matter ?
she writes to me that nikolay , my brother , is at death s door .
i shall go to him .
kitty s face changed at once .
thoughts of tanya as a marquise , of dolly , all had vanished .
when are you going ?
she said .
tomorrow .
and i will go with you , can i ?
she said .
kitty !
what are you thinking of ?
he said reproachfully .
how do you mean ?
offended that he should seem to take her suggestion unwillingly and with vexation .
why shouldn t i go ?
i shan t be in your way .
i i m going because my brother is dying , said levin .
why should you why ?
for the same reason as you .
and , at a moment of such gravity for me , she only thinks of her being dull by herself , thought levin .
and this lack of candor in a matter of such gravity infuriated him .
it s out of the question , he said sternly .
agafea mihalovna , seeing that it was coming to a quarrel , gently put down her cup and withdrew .
kitty did not even notice her .
the tone in which her husband had said the last words wounded her , especially because he evidently did not believe what she had said .
i tell you , that if you go , i shall come with you ; i shall certainly come , she said hastily and wrathfully .
why out of the question ?
why do you say it s out of the question ?
because it ll be going god knows where , by all sorts of roads and to all sorts of hotels .
you would be a hindrance to me , said levin , trying to be cool .
not at all .
i don t want anything .
where you can go , i can well , for one thing then , because this woman s there whom you can t meet .
i don t know and don t care to know who s there and what .
i know that my husband s brother is dying and my husband is going to him , and i go with my husband too kitty !
don t get angry .
but just think a little this is a matter of such importance that i can t bear to think that you should bring in a feeling of weakness , of dislike to being left alone .
come , you ll be dull alone , so go and stay at moscow a little .
there , you always ascribe base , vile motives to me , she said with tears of wounded pride and fury .
i didn t mean , it wasn t weakness , it wasn t
i feel that it s my duty to be with my husband when he s in trouble , but you try on purpose to hurt me , you try on purpose not to understand no ; this is awful !
to be such a slave !
cried levin , getting up , and unable to restrain his anger any longer .
but at the same second he felt that he was beating himself .
then why did you marry ?
you could have been free .
why did you , if you regret it ?
she said , getting up and running away into the drawing room .
when he went to her , she was sobbing .
he began to speak , trying to find words not to dissuade but simply to soothe her .
but she did not heed him , and would not agree to anything .
he bent down to her and took her hand , which resisted him .
he kissed her hand , kissed her hair , kissed her hand she was silent .
but when he took her face in both his hands and said kitty !
she suddenly recovered herself , and began to cry , and they were reconciled .
it was decided that they should go together the next day .
levin told his wife that he believed she wanted to go simply in order to be of use , agreed that marya nikolaevna s being with his brother did not make her going improper , but he set off at the bottom of his heart dissatisfied both with her and with himself .
he was dissatisfied with her for being unable to make up her mind to let him go when it was necessary ( and how strange it was for him to think that he , so lately hardly daring to believe in such happiness as that she could love was unhappy because she loved him too much !
) , and he was dissatisfied with himself for not showing more strength of will .
even greater was the feeling of disagreement at the bottom of his heart as to her not needing to consider the woman who was with his brother , and he thought with horror of all the contingencies they might meet with .
the mere idea of his wife , his kitty , being in the same room with a common wench , set him shuddering with horror and loathing .
the hotel of the provincial town where nikolay levin was lying ill was one of those provincial hotels which are constructed on the newest model of modern improvements , with the best intentions of cleanliness , comfort , and even elegance , but owing to the public that patronizes them , are with astounding rapidity transformed into filthy taverns with a pretension of modern improvement that only makes them worse than the , honestly filthy hotels .
this hotel had already reached that stage , and the soldier in a filthy uniform smoking in the entry , supposed to stand for a , and the , slippery , dark , and disagreeable staircase , and the free and easy waiter in a filthy frock coat , and the common dining room with a dusty bouquet of wax flowers adorning the table , and filth , dust , and disorder everywhere , and at the same time the sort of modern railway uneasiness of this hotel , aroused a most painful feeling in levin after their fresh young life , especially because the impression of falsity made by the hotel was so out of keeping with what awaited them .
as is invariably the case , after they had been asked at what price they wanted rooms , it appeared that there was not one decent room for them ; one decent room had been taken by the inspector of railroads , another by a lawyer from moscow , a third by princess astafieva from the country .
there remained only one filthy room , next to which they promised that another should be empty by the evening .
feeling angry with his wife because what he had expected had come to pass , which was that at the moment of arrival , when his heart throbbed with emotion and anxiety to know how his brother was getting on , he should have to be seeing after her , instead of rushing straight to his brother , levin conducted her to the room assigned them .
go , do go !
she said , looking at him with timid and guilty eyes .
he went out of the door without a word , and at once stumbled over marya nikolaevna , who had heard of his arrival and had not dared to go in to see him .
she was just the same as when he saw her in moscow ; the same woolen gown , and bare arms and neck , and the same stupid , pockmarked face , only a little plumper .
well , how is he ?
how is he ?
very bad .
he can t get up .
he has kept expecting you .
he are you with your wife ?
levin did not for the first moment understand what it was confused her , but she immediately enlightened him .
i ll go away .
i ll go down to the kitchen , she brought out .
nikolay dmitrievitch will be delighted .
he heard about it , and knows your lady , and remembers her abroad .
levin realized that she meant his wife , and did not know what answer to make .
come along , come along to him !
he said .
but as soon as he moved , the door of his room opened and kitty peeped out .
levin crimsoned both from shame and anger with his wife , who had put herself and him in such a difficult position ; but marya nikolaevna crimsoned still more .
she positively shrank together and flushed to the point of tears , and clutching the ends of her apron in both hands , twisted them in her red fingers without knowing what to say and what to do .
for the first instant levin saw an expression of eager curiosity in the eyes with which kitty looked at this awful woman , so incomprehensible to her ; but it lasted only a single instant .
well !
how is he ?
she turned to her husband and then to her .
but one can t go on talking in the passage like this !
levin said , looking angrily at a gentleman who walked jauntily at that instant across the corridor , as though about his affairs .
well then , come in , said kitty , turning to marya nikolaevna , who had recovered herself , but noticing her husband s face of dismay , or go on ; go , and then come for me , she said , and went back into the room .
levin went to his brother s room .
he had not in the least expected what he saw and felt in his brother s room .
he had expected to find him in the same state of which he had heard was so frequent with the consumptive , and which had struck him so much during his brother s visit in the autumn .
he had expected to find the physical signs of the approach of death more weakness , greater emaciation , but still almost the same condition of things .
he had expected himself to feel the same distress at the loss of the brother he loved and the same horror in face of death as he had felt then , only in a greater degree .
and he had prepared himself for this ; but he found something utterly different .
in a little dirty room with the painted panels of its walls filthy with spittle , and conversation audible through the thin partition from the next room , in a stifling atmosphere saturated with impurities , on a bedstead moved away from the wall , there lay covered with a quilt , a body .
one arm of this body was above the quilt , and the wrist , huge as a , was attached , inconceivably it seemed , to the thin , long bone of the arm smooth from the beginning to the middle .
the head lay sideways on the pillow .
levin could see the scanty locks wet with sweat on the temples and tense , forehead .
it can not be that that fearful body was my brother nikolay ?
thought levin .
but he went closer , saw the face , and doubt became impossible .
in spite of the terrible change in the face , levin had only to glance at those eager eyes raised at his approach , only to catch the faint movement of the mouth under the sticky mustache , to realize the terrible truth that this body was his living brother .
the glittering eyes looked sternly and reproachfully at his brother as he drew near .
and immediately this glance established a living relationship between living men .
levin immediately felt the reproach in the eyes fixed on him , and felt remorse at his own happiness .
when konstantin took him by the hand , nikolay smiled .
the smile was faint , scarcely perceptible , and in spite of the smile the stern expression of the eyes was unchanged .
you did not expect to find me like this , he articulated with effort .
yes no , said levin , hesitating over his words .
how was it you didn t let me know before , that is , at the time of my wedding ?
i made inquiries in all directions .
he had to talk so as not to be silent , and he did not know what to say , especially as his brother made no reply , and simply stared without dropping his eyes , and evidently penetrated to the inner meaning of each word .
levin told his brother that his wife had come with him .
nikolay expressed pleasure , but said he was afraid of frightening her by his condition .
a silence followed .
suddenly nikolay stirred , and began to say something .
levin expected something of peculiar gravity and importance from the expression of his face , but nikolay began speaking of his health .
he found fault with the doctor , regretting he had not a celebrated moscow doctor .
levin saw that he still hoped .
seizing the first moment of silence , levin got up , anxious to escape , if only for an instant , from his agonizing emotion , and said that he would go and fetch his wife .
very well , and i ll tell her to tidy up here .
it s dirty and stinking here , i expect .
marya !
clear up the room , the sick man said with effort .
oh , and when you ve cleared up , go away yourself , he added , looking inquiringly at his brother .
levin made no answer .
going out into the corridor , he stopped short .
he had said he would fetch his wife , but now , taking stock of the emotion he was feeling , he decided that he would try on the contrary to persuade her not to go in to the sick man .
why should she suffer as i am suffering ?
he thought .
well , how is he ?
kitty asked with a frightened face .
oh , it s awful , it s awful !
what did you come for ?
said levin .
kitty was silent for a few seconds , looking timidly and ruefully at her husband ; then she went up and took him by the elbow with both hands .
kostya !
take me to him ; it will be easier for us to bear it together .
you only take me , take me to him , please , and go away , she said .
you must understand that for me to see you , and not to see him , is far more painful .
there i might be a help to you and to him .
please , let me !
she besought her husband , as though the happiness of her life depended on it .
levin was obliged to agree , and regaining his composure , and completely forgetting about marya nikolaevna by now , he went again in to his brother with kitty .
stepping lightly , and continually glancing at her husband , showing him a valorous and sympathetic face , kitty went into the , and , turning without haste , noiselessly closed the door .
with inaudible steps she went quickly to the sick man s bedside , and going up so that he had not to turn his head , she immediately clasped in her fresh young hand the skeleton of his huge hand , pressed it , and began speaking with that soft eagerness , sympathetic and not jarring , which is peculiar to women .
we have met , though we were not acquainted , at soden , she said .
you never thought i was to be your sister ?
you would not have recognized me ?
he said , with a radiant smile at her entrance .
yes , i should .
what a good thing you let us know !
not a day has passed that kostya has not mentioned you , and been anxious .
but the sick man s interest did not last long .
before she had finished speaking , there had come back into his face the stern , reproachful expression of the dying man s envy of the living .
i am afraid you are not quite comfortable here , she said , turning away from his fixed stare , and looking about the room .
we must ask about another room , she said to her husband , so that we might be nearer .
levin could not look calmly at his brother ; he could not himself be natural and calm in his presence .
when he went in to the sick man , his eyes and his attention were unconsciously dimmed , and he did not see and did not distinguish the details of his brother s position .
he smelt the awful odor , saw the dirt , disorder , and miserable condition , and heard the groans , and felt that nothing could be done to help .
it never entered his head to analyze the details of the sick man s situation , to consider how that body was lying under the quilt , how those emaciated legs and thighs and spine were lying huddled up , and whether they could not be made more comfortable , whether anything could not be done to make things , if not better , at least less bad .
it made his blood run cold when he began to think of all these details .
he was absolutely convinced that nothing could be done to prolong his brother s life or to relieve his suffering .
but a sense of his regarding all aid as out of the question was felt by the sick man , and exasperated him .
and this made it still more painful for levin .
to be in the was agony to him , not to be there still worse .
and he was continually , on various pretexts , going out of the room , and coming in again , because he was unable to remain alone .
but kitty thought , and felt , and acted quite differently .
on seeing the sick man , she pitied him .
and pity in her womanly heart did not arouse at all that feeling of horror and loathing that it aroused in her husband , but a desire to act , to find out all the details of his state , and to remedy them .
and since she had not the slightest doubt that it was her duty to help him , she had no doubt either that it was possible , and immediately set to work .
the very details , the mere thought of which reduced her husband to terror , immediately engaged her attention .
she sent for the doctor , sent to the chemist s , set the maid who had come with her and marya nikolaevna to sweep and dust and scrub ; she herself washed up something , washed out something else , laid something under the quilt .
something was by her directions brought into the , something else was carried out .
she herself went several times to her room , regardless of the men she met in the corridor , got out and brought in sheets , pillow cases , towels , and shirts .
the waiter , who was busy with a party of engineers dining in the dining hall , came several times with an irate countenance in answer to her summons , and could not avoid carrying out her orders , as she gave them with such gracious insistence that there was no evading her .
levin did not approve of all this ; he did not believe it would be of any good to the patient .
above all , he feared the patient would be angry at it .
but the sick man , though he seemed and was indifferent about it , was not angry , but only abashed , and on the whole as it were interested in what she was doing with him .
coming back from the doctor to whom kitty had sent him , levin , on opening the door , came upon the sick man at the instant when , by kitty s directions , they were changing his linen .
the long white ridge of his spine , with the huge , prominent shoulder blades and jutting ribs and vertebrae , was bare , and marya nikolaevna and the waiter were struggling with the sleeve of the night shirt , and could not get the long , limp arm into it .
kitty , hurriedly closing the door after levin , was not looking that way ; but the sick man groaned , and she moved rapidly towards him .
make haste , she said .
oh , don t you come , said the sick man angrily .
i ll do it my myself what say ?
queried marya nikolaevna .
but kitty heard and saw he was ashamed and uncomfortable at being naked before her .
i m not looking , i m not looking !
she said , putting the arm in .
marya nikolaevna , you come this side , you do it , she added .
please go for me , there s a little bottle in my small bag , she said , turning to her husband , you know , in the side pocket ; bring it , please , and meanwhile they ll finish clearing up here .
returning with the bottle , levin found the sick man settled comfortably and everything about him completely changed .
the heavy smell was replaced by the smell of aromatic vinegar , which kitty with pouting lips and , rosy cheeks was squirting through a little pipe .
there was no dust visible anywhere , a rug was laid by the bedside .
on the table stood medicine bottles and decanters tidily arranged , and the linen needed was folded up there , and kitty s .
on the other table by the patient s bed there were candles and drink and powders .
the sick man himself , washed and combed , lay in clean sheets on high raised pillows , in a clean with a white collar about his astoundingly thin neck , and with a new expression of hope looked fixedly at kitty .
the doctor brought by levin , and found by him at the club , was not the one who had been attending nikolay levin , as the patient was dissatisfied with him .
the new doctor took up a stethoscope and sounded the patient , shook his head , prescribed medicine , and with extreme minuteness explained first how to take the medicine and then what diet was to be kept to .
he advised eggs , raw or hardly cooked , and seltzer water , with warm milk at a certain temperature .
when the doctor had gone away the sick man said something to his brother , of which levin could distinguish only the last words your katya .
by the expression with which he gazed at her , levin saw that he was praising her .
he called indeed to katya , as he called her .
i m much better already , he said .
why , with you i should have got well long ago .
how nice it is !
he took her hand and drew it towards his lips , but as though afraid she would dislike it he changed his mind , let it go , and only stroked it .
kitty took his hand in both hers and pressed it .
now turn me over on the left side and go to bed , he said .
no one could make out what he said but kitty ; she alone understood .
she understood because she was all the while mentally keeping watch on what he needed .
on the other side , she said to her husband , he always sleeps on that side .
turn him over , it s so disagreeable calling the servants .
i m not strong enough .
can you ?
she said to marya nikolaevna .
i m afraid not , answered marya nikolaevna .
terrible as it was to levin to put his arms round that terrible body , to take hold of that under the quilt , of which he preferred to know nothing , under his wife s influence he made his resolute face that she knew so well , and putting his arms into the bed took hold of the body , but in spite of his own strength he was struck by the strange heaviness of those powerless limbs .
while he was turning him over , conscious of the huge emaciated arm about his neck , kitty swiftly and noiselessly turned the pillow , beat it up and settled in it the sick man s head , smoothing back his hair , which was sticking again to his moist brow .
the sick man kept his brother s hand in his own .
levin felt that he meant to do something with his hand and was pulling it somewhere .
levin yielded with a sinking heart yes , he drew it to his mouth and kissed it .
levin , shaking with sobs and unable to articulate a word , went out of the room .
thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent , and hast revealed them unto babes .
so levin thought about his wife as he talked to her that evening .
levin thought of the text , not because he considered himself wise and prudent .
he did not so consider himself , but he could not help knowing that he had more intellect than his wife and agafea mihalovna , and he could not help knowing that when he thought of death , he thought with all the force of his intellect .
he knew too that the brains of many great men , whose thoughts he had read , had brooded over death and yet knew not a hundredth part of what his wife and agafea mihalovna knew about it .
different as those two women were , agafea mihalovna and katya , as his brother nikolay had called her , and as levin particularly liked to call her now , they were quite alike in this .
both knew , without a shade of doubt , what sort of thing life was and what was death , and though neither of them could have answered , and would even not have understood the questions that presented themselves to levin , both had no doubt of the significance of this event , and were precisely alike in their way of looking at it , which they shared with millions of people .
the proof that they knew for a certainty the nature of death lay in the fact that they knew without a second of hesitation how to deal with the dying , and were not frightened of them .
levin and other men like him , though they could have said a great deal about death , obviously did not know this since they were afraid of death , and were absolutely at a loss what to do when people were dying .
if levin had been alone now with his brother nikolay , he would have looked at him with terror , and with still greater terror waited , and would not have known what else to do .
more than that , he did not know what to say , how to look , how to move .
to talk of outside things seemed to him shocking , impossible , to talk of death and depressing impossible .
to be silent , also impossible .
if i look at him he will think i am studying him , i am afraid ; if i don t look at him , he ll think i m thinking of other things .
if i walk on tiptoe , he will be vexed ; to tread firmly , i m ashamed .
kitty evidently did not think of herself , and had no time to think about herself she was thinking about him because she knew something , and all went well .
she told him about herself even and about her wedding , and smiled and sympathized with him and petted him , and talked of cases of recovery and all went well ; so then she must know .
the proof that her behavior and agafea mihalovna s was not instinctive , animal , irrational , was that apart from the physical treatment , the relief of suffering , both agafea mihalovna and kitty required for the dying man something else more important than the physical treatment , and something which had nothing in common with physical conditions .
agafea mihalovna , speaking of the man just dead , had said well , thank god , he took the sacrament and received absolution ; god grant each one of us such a death .
katya in just the same way , besides all her care about linen , bedsores , drink , found time the very first day to persuade the sick man of the necessity of taking the sacrament and receiving absolution .
on getting back from the to their own two rooms for the night , levin sat with hanging head not knowing what to do .
not to speak of supper , of preparing for bed , of considering what they were going to do , he could not even talk to his wife ; he was ashamed to .
kitty , on the contrary , was more active than usual .
she was even livelier than usual .
she ordered supper to be brought , herself unpacked their things , and herself helped to make the beds , and did not even forget to sprinkle them with persian powder .
she showed that alertness , that swiftness of reflection comes out in men before a battle , in conflict , in the dangerous and decisive moments of moments when a man shows once and for all his value , and that all his past has not been wasted but has been a preparation for these moments .
everything went rapidly in her hands , and before it was twelve o clock all their things were arranged cleanly and tidily in her rooms , in such a way that the hotel rooms seemed like home the beds were made , brushes , combs , were put out , table napkins were spread .
levin felt that it was unpardonable to eat , to sleep , to talk even now , and it seemed to him that every movement he made was unseemly .
she arranged the brushes , but she did it all so that there was nothing shocking in it .
they could neither of them eat , however , and for a long while they could not sleep , and did not even go to bed .
i am very glad i persuaded him to receive extreme unction tomorrow , she said , sitting in her dressing jacket before her folding looking glass , combing her soft , fragrant hair with a fine comb .
i have never seen it , but i know , mamma has told me , there are prayers said for recovery .
do you suppose he can possibly recover ?
said levin , watching a slender tress at the back of her round little head that was continually hidden when she passed the comb through the front .
i asked the doctor ; he said he couldn t live more than three days .
but can they be sure ?
i m very glad , anyway , that i persuaded him , she said , looking askance at her husband through her hair .
anything is possible , she added with that peculiar , rather sly expression that was always in her face when she spoke of religion .
since their conversation about religion when they were engaged neither of them had ever started a discussion of the subject , but she performed all the ceremonies of going to church , saying her prayers , and so on , always with the unvarying conviction that this ought to be so .
in spite of his assertion to the contrary , she was firmly persuaded that he was as much a christian as she , and indeed a far better one ; and all that he said about it was simply one of his absurd masculine freaks , just as he would say about her that good people patch holes , but that she cut them on purpose , and so on .
yes , you see this woman , marya nikolaevna , did not know how to manage all this , said levin .
and
i must own i m very , very glad you came .
you are such purity that he took her hand and did not kiss it ( to kiss her hand in such closeness to death seemed to him improper ) ; he merely squeezed it with a penitent air , looking at her brightening eyes .
it would have been miserable for you to be alone , she said , and lifting her hands which hid her cheeks flushing with pleasure , twisted her coil of hair on the nape of her neck and pinned it there .
no , she went on , she did not know how luckily , i learned a lot at soden .
surely there are not people there so ill ?
worse .
what s so awful to me is that i can t see him as he was when he was young .
you would not believe how charming he was as a youth , but i did not understand him then .
i can quite , quite believe it .
how i feel that we might have been friends !
she said ; and , distressed at what she had said , she looked round at her husband , and tears came into her eyes .
yes , have , he said mournfully .
he s just one of those people of whom they say they re not for this world .
but we have many days before us ; we must go to bed , said kitty , glancing at her tiny watch .
the next day the sick man received the sacrament and extreme unction .
during the ceremony nikolay levin prayed fervently .
his great eyes , fastened on the holy image that was set out on a card table covered with a colored napkin , expressed such passionate prayer and hope that it was awful to levin to see it .
levin knew that this passionate prayer and hope would only make him feel more bitterly parting from the life he so loved .
levin knew his brother and the workings of his intellect he knew that his unbelief came not from life being easier for him without faith , but had grown up because step by step the contemporary scientific interpretation of natural phenomena crushed out the possibility of faith ; and so he knew that his present return was not a legitimate one , brought about by way of the same working of his intellect , but simply a temporary , interested return to faith in a desperate hope of recovery .
levin knew too that kitty had strengthened his hope by accounts of the marvelous recoveries she had heard of .
levin knew all this ; and it was agonizingly painful to him to behold the supplicating , hopeful eyes and the emaciated wrist , lifted with difficulty , making the sign of the cross on the tense brow , and the prominent shoulders and hollow , gasping chest , which one could not feel consistent with the life the sick man was praying for .
during the sacrament levin did what he , an unbeliever , had done a thousand times .
he said , addressing god , if thou dost exist , make this man to recover ( of course this same thing has been repeated many times ) , and thou wilt save him and me .
after extreme unction the sick man became suddenly much better .
he did not cough once in the course of an hour , smiled , kissed kitty s hand , thanking her with tears , and said he was comfortable , free from pain , and that he felt strong and had an appetite .
he even raised himself when his soup was brought , and asked for a cutlet as well .
hopelessly ill as he was , obvious as it was at the first glance that he could not recover , levin and kitty were for that hour both in the same state of excitement , happy , though fearful of being mistaken .
is he better ?
yes , much .
it s wonderful .
there s nothing wonderful in it .
anyway , he s better , they said in a whisper , smiling to one another .
this was not of long duration .
the sick man fell into a quiet sleep , but he was waked up half an hour later by his cough .
and all at once every hope vanished in those about him and in himself .
the reality of his suffering crushed all hopes in levin and kitty and in the sick man himself , leaving no doubt , no memory even of past hopes .
without referring to what he had believed in half an hour before , as though ashamed even to recall it , he asked for iodine to inhale in a bottle covered with perforated paper .
levin gave him the bottle , and the same look of passionate hope with which he had taken the sacrament was now fastened on his brother , demanding from him the confirmation of the doctor s words that inhaling iodine worked wonders .
is katya not here ?
he gasped , looking round while levin reluctantly assented to the doctor s words .
no ; so i can say it
it was for her sake i went through that farce .
she s so sweet ; but you and i can t deceive ourselves .
this is what i believe in , he said , and , squeezing the bottle in his bony hand , he began breathing over it .
at eight o clock in the evening levin and his wife were drinking tea in their room when marya nikolaevna ran in to them breathlessly .
she was pale , and her lips were quivering .
he is dying !
she whispered .
i m afraid will die this minute .
both of them ran to him .
he was sitting raised up with one elbow on the bed , his long back bent , and his head hanging low .
how do you feel ?
levin asked in a whisper , after a silence .
i feel i m setting off , nikolay said with difficulty , but with extreme distinctness , screwing the words out of himself .
he did not raise his head , but simply turned his eyes upwards , without their reaching his brother s face .
katya , go away !
he added .
levin jumped up , and with a peremptory whisper made her go out .
i m setting off , he said again .
why do you think so ?
said levin , so as to say something .
because i m setting off , he repeated , as though he had a liking for the phrase .
it s the end .
marya nikolaevna went up to him .
you had better lie down ; you d be easier , she said .
i shall lie down soon enough , he pronounced slowly , when i m dead , he said sarcastically , wrathfully .
well , you can lay me down if you like .
levin laid his brother on his back , sat down beside him , and gazed at his face , holding his breath .
the dying man lay with closed eyes , but the muscles twitched from time to time on his forehead , as with one thinking deeply and intensely .
levin involuntarily thought with him of what it was that was happening to him now , but in spite of all his mental efforts to go along with him he saw by the expression of that calm , stern face that for the dying man all was growing clearer and clearer that was still as dark as ever for levin .
yes , yes , so , the dying man articulated slowly at intervals .
wait a little .
he was silent .
right !
he pronounced all at once reassuringly , as though all were solved for him .
o lord !
he murmured , and sighed deeply .
marya nikolaevna felt his feet .
they re getting cold , she whispered .
for a long while , a very long while it seemed to levin , the sick man lay motionless .
but he was still alive , and from time to time he sighed .
levin by now was exhausted from mental strain .
he felt that , with no mental effort , could he understand what it was that was .
he could not even think of the problem of death itself , but with no will of his own thoughts kept coming to him of what he had to do next ; closing the dead man s eyes , dressing him , ordering the coffin .
and , strange to say , he felt utterly cold , and was not conscious of sorrow nor of loss , less still of pity for his brother .
if he had any feeling for his brother at that moment , it was envy for the knowledge the dying man had now that he could not have .
a long time more he sat over him so , continually expecting the end .
but the end did not come .
the door opened and kitty appeared .
levin got up to stop her .
but at the moment he was getting up , he caught the sound of the dying man stirring .
don t go away , said nikolay and held out his hand .
levin gave him his , and angrily waved to his wife to go away .
with the dying man s hand in his hand , he sat for half an hour , an hour , another hour .
he did not think of death at all now .
he wondered what kitty was doing ; who lived in the next room ; whether the doctor lived in a house of his own .
he longed for food and for sleep .
he cautiously drew away his hand and felt the feet .
the feet were cold , but the sick man was still breathing .
levin tried again to move away on tiptoe , but the sick man stirred again and said don t go .
the dawn came ; the sick man s condition was unchanged .
levin stealthily withdrew his hand , and without looking at the dying man , went off to his own room and went to sleep .
when he woke up , instead of news of his brother s death which he expected , he learned that the sick man had returned to his earlier condition .
he had begun sitting up again , coughing , had begun eating again , talking again , and again had ceased to talk of death , again had begun to express hope of his recovery , and had become more irritable and more gloomy than ever .
no one , neither his brother nor kitty , could soothe him .
he was angry with everyone , and said nasty things to everyone , reproached everyone for his sufferings , and insisted that they should get him a celebrated doctor from moscow .
to all inquiries made him as to how he felt , he made the same answer with an expression of vindictive reproachfulness , i m suffering horribly , intolerably !
the sick man was suffering more and more , especially from bedsores , which it was impossible now to remedy , and grew more and more angry with everyone about him , blaming them for everything , and especially for not having brought him a doctor from moscow .
kitty tried in every possible way to relieve him , to soothe him ; but it was all in vain , and levin saw that she herself was exhausted both physically and morally , though she would not admit it .
the sense of death , which had been evoked in all by his taking leave of life on the night when he had sent for his brother , was broken up .
everyone knew that he must inevitably die soon , that he was half dead already .
everyone wished for nothing but that he should die as soon as possible , and everyone , concealing this , gave him medicines , tried to find remedies and doctors , and deceived him and themselves and each other .
all this was falsehood , disgusting , irreverent deceit .
and owing to the bent of his character , and because he loved the dying man more than anyone else did , levin was most painfully conscious of this deceit .
levin , who had long been possessed by the idea of reconciling his brothers , at least in face of death , had written to his brother , sergey ivanovitch , and having received an answer from him , he read this letter to the sick man .
sergey ivanovitch wrote that he could not come himself , and in touching terms he begged his brother s forgiveness .
the sick man said nothing .
what am i to write to him ?
said levin .
i hope you are not angry with him ?
no , not the least !
nikolay answered , vexed at the question .
tell him to send me a doctor .
three more days of agony followed ; the sick man was still in the same condition .
the sense of longing for his death was felt by everyone now at the mere sight of him , by the waiters and the and all the people staying in the hotel , and the doctor and marya nikolaevna and levin and kitty .
the sick man alone did not express this feeling , but on the contrary was furious at their not getting him doctors , and went on taking medicine and talking of life .
only at rare moments , when the opium gave him an instant s relief from the pain , he would sometimes , half asleep , utter what was ever more intense in his heart than in all the others oh , if it were only the end !
or when will it be over ?
his sufferings , steadily growing more intense , did their work and prepared him for death .
there was no position in which he was not in pain , there was not a minute in which he was unconscious of it , not a limb , not a part of his body that did not ache and cause him agony .
even the memories , the impressions , the thoughts of this body awakened in him now the same aversion as the body itself .
the sight of other people , their remarks , his own reminiscences , everything was for him a source of agony .
those about him felt this , and instinctively did not allow themselves to move freely , to talk , to express their wishes before him .
all his life was merged in the one feeling of suffering and desire to be rid of it .
there was evidently coming over him that revulsion that would make him look upon death as the goal of his desires , as happiness .
hitherto each individual desire , aroused by suffering or privation , such as hunger , fatigue , thirst , had been satisfied by some bodily function giving pleasure .
but now no physical craving or suffering received relief , and the effort to relieve them only caused fresh suffering .
and so all desires were merged in desire to be rid of all his sufferings and their source , the body .
but he had no words to express this desire of deliverance , and so he did not speak of it , and from habit asked for the satisfaction of desires which could not now be satisfied .
turn me over on the other side , he would say , and immediately after he would ask to be turned back again as before .
give me some broth .
take away the broth .
talk of something why are you silent ?
and directly they began to talk he would close his eyes , and would show weariness , indifference , and loathing .
on the tenth day from their arrival at the town , kitty was unwell .
she suffered from headache and sickness , and she could not get up all the morning .
the doctor opined that the indisposition arose from fatigue and excitement , and prescribed rest .
after dinner , however , kitty got up and went as usual with her work to the sick man .
he looked at her sternly when she came in , and smiled contemptuously when she said she had been unwell .
that day he was continually blowing his nose , and groaning piteously .
how do you feel ?
she asked him .
worse , he articulated with difficulty .
in pain !
in pain , where ?
everywhere .
it will be over today , you will see , said marya nikolaevna .
though it was said in a whisper , the sick man , whose hearing levin had noticed was very keen , must have heard .
levin said hush to her , and looked round at the sick man .
nikolay had heard ; but these words produced no effect on him .
his eyes had still the same intense , reproachful look .
why do you think so ?
levin asked her , when she had followed him into the corridor .
he has begun picking at himself , said marya nikolaevna .
how do you mean ?
like this , she said , tugging at the folds of her woolen skirt .
levin noticed , indeed , that all that day the patient pulled at himself , as it were , trying to snatch something away .
marya nikolaevna s prediction came true .
towards night the sick man was not able to lift his hands , and could only gaze before him with the same intensely concentrated expression in his eyes .
even when his brother or kitty bent over him , so that he could see them , he looked just the same .
kitty sent for the priest to read the prayer for the dying .
while the priest was reading it , the dying man did not show any sign of life ; his eyes were closed .
levin , kitty , and marya nikolaevna stood at the bedside .
the priest had not quite finished reading the prayer when the dying man stretched , sighed , and opened his eyes .
the priest , on finishing the prayer , put the cross to the cold forehead , then slowly returned it to the stand , and after standing for two minutes more in silence , he touched the huge , bloodless hand that was turning cold .
he is gone , said the priest , and would have moved away ; but suddenly there was a faint stir in the mustaches of the dead man that seemed glued together , and quite distinctly in the hush they heard from the bottom of the chest the sharply defined sounds not quite
soon .
and a minute later the face brightened , a smile came out under the mustaches , and the women who had gathered round began carefully laying out the corpse .
the sight of his brother , and the nearness of death , revived in levin that sense of horror in face of the insoluble enigma , together with the nearness and inevitability of death , that had come upon him that autumn evening when his brother had come to him .
this feeling was now even stronger than before ; even less than before did he feel capable of apprehending the meaning of death , and its inevitability rose up before him more terrible than ever .
but now , thanks to his wife s presence , that feeling did not reduce him to despair .
in spite of death , he felt the need of life and love .
he felt that love saved him from despair , and that this love , under the menace of despair , had become still stronger and purer .
the one mystery of death , still unsolved , had scarcely passed before his eyes , when another mystery had arisen , as insoluble , urging him to love and to life .
the doctor confirmed his suppositions in regard to kitty .
her indisposition was a symptom that she was with child .
from the moment when alexey alexandrovitch understood from his interviews with betsy and with stepan arkadyevitch that all that was expected of him was to leave his wife in peace , without burdening her with his presence , and that his wife herself desired this , he felt so distraught that he could come to no decision of himself ; he did not know himself what he wanted now , and putting himself in the hands of those who were so pleased to interest themselves in his affairs , he met everything with unqualified assent .
it was only when anna had left his house , and the english governess sent to ask him whether she should dine with him or separately , that for the first time he clearly comprehended his position , and was appalled by it .
most difficult of all in this position was the fact that he could not in any way connect and reconcile his past with what was now .
it was not the past when he had lived happily with his wife that troubled him .
the transition from that past to a knowledge of his wife s unfaithfulness he had lived through miserably already ; that state was painful , but he could understand it .
if his wife had then , on declaring to him her unfaithfulness , left him , he would have been wounded , unhappy , but he would not have been in the hopeless to which he felt himself now .
he could not now reconcile his immediate past , his tenderness , his love for his sick wife , and for the other man s child with what was now the case , that is with the fact that , as it were , in return for all this he now found himself alone , put to shame , a , needed by no one , and despised by everyone .
for the first two days after his wife s departure alexey alexandrovitch received applicants for assistance and his chief secretary , drove to the committee , and went down to dinner in the dining room as usual .
without giving himself a reason for what he was doing , he strained every nerve of his being for those two days , simply to preserve an appearance of composure , and even of indifference .
answering inquiries about the disposition of anna arkadyevna s rooms and belongings , he had exercised immense to appear like a man in whose eyes what had occurred was not unforeseen nor out of the ordinary course of events , and he attained his aim no one could have detected in him signs of despair .
but on the second day after her departure , when korney gave him a bill from a fashionable draper s shop , which anna had forgotten to pay , and announced that the clerk from the shop was waiting , alexey alexandrovitch told him to show the clerk up .
excuse me , your excellency , for venturing to trouble you .
but if you direct us to apply to her excellency , would you graciously oblige us with her address ?
alexey alexandrovitch pondered , as it seemed to the clerk , and all at once , turning round , he sat down at the table .
letting his head sink into his hands , he sat for a long while in that position , several times attempted to speak and stopped short .
korney , perceiving his master s emotion , asked the clerk to call another time .
left alone , alexey alexandrovitch recognized that he had not the strength to keep up the line of firmness and composure any longer .
he gave orders for the carriage that was awaiting him to be taken back , and for no one to be admitted , and he did not go down to dinner .
he felt that he could not endure the weight of universal contempt and exasperation , which he had distinctly seen in the face of the clerk and of korney , and of everyone , without exception , whom he had met during those two days .
he felt that he could not turn aside from himself the hatred of men , because that hatred did not come from his being bad ( in that case he could have tried to be better ) , but from his being shamefully and repulsively unhappy .
he knew that for this , for the very fact that his heart was torn with grief , they would be merciless to him .
he felt that men would crush him as dogs strangle a torn dog yelping with pain .
he knew that his sole means of security against people was to hide his wounds from them , and instinctively he tried to do this for two days , but now he felt incapable of keeping up the unequal struggle .
his despair was even intensified by the consciousness that he was utterly alone in his sorrow .
in all petersburg there was not a human being to whom he could express what he was feeling , who would feel for him , not as a high official , not as a member of society , but simply as a suffering man ; indeed he had not such a one in the whole world .
alexey alexandrovitch grew up an orphan .
there were two brothers .
they did not remember their father , and their mother died when alexey alexandrovitch was ten years old .
the property was a small one .
their uncle , karenin , a government official of high standing , at one time a favorite of the late tsar , had brought them up .
on completing his high school and university courses with medals , alexey alexandrovitch had , with his uncle s aid , immediately started in a prominent position in the service , and from that time forward he had devoted himself exclusively to political ambition .
in the high school and the university , and afterwards in the service , alexey alexandrovitch had never formed a close friendship with anyone .
his brother had been the person nearest to his heart , but he had a post in the ministry of foreign affairs , and was always abroad , where he had died shortly after alexey alexandrovitch s marriage .
while he was governor of a province , anna s aunt , a wealthy provincial lady , had thrown as he was , though young for a her niece , and had succeeded in putting him in such a position that he had either to declare himself or to leave the town .
alexey alexandrovitch was not long in hesitation .
there were at the time as many reasons for the step as against it , and there was no overbalancing consideration to outweigh his invariable rule of abstaining when in doubt .
but anna s aunt had through a common acquaintance insinuated that he had already compromised the girl , and that he was in honor bound to make her an offer .
he made the offer , and concentrated on his betrothed and his wife all the feeling of which he was capable .
the attachment he felt to anna precluded in his heart every need of intimate relations with others .
and now among all his acquaintances he had not one friend .
he had plenty of connections , but no friendships .
alexey alexandrovitch had plenty of people whom he could invite to dinner , to whose sympathy he could appeal in any public affair he was concerned about , whose interest he could reckon upon for anyone he wished to help , with whom he could candidly discuss other people s business and affairs of state .
but his relations with these people were confined to one clearly defined channel , and had a certain routine from which it was impossible to depart .
there was one man , a comrade of his at the university , with whom he had made friends later , and with whom he could have spoken of a personal sorrow ; but this friend had a post in the department of education in a remote part of russia .
of the people in petersburg the most intimate and most possible were his chief secretary and his doctor .
mihail vassilievitch sludin , the chief secretary , was a straightforward , intelligent , , and conscientious man , and alexey alexandrovitch was aware of his personal goodwill .
but their five years of official work together seemed to have put a barrier between them that cut off warmer relations .
after signing the papers brought him , alexey alexandrovitch had sat for a long while in silence , glancing at mihail vassilievitch , and several times he attempted to speak , but could not .
he had already prepared the phrase you have heard of my trouble ?
but he ended by saying , as usual so you ll get this ready for me ?
and with that dismissed him .
the other person was the doctor , who had also a kindly feeling for him ; but there had long existed a taciturn understanding between them that both were weighed down by work , and always in a hurry .
of his women friends , foremost amongst them countess lidia ivanovna , alexey alexandrovitch never thought .
all women , simply as women , were terrible and distasteful to him .
alexey alexandrovitch had forgotten the countess lidia ivanovna , but she had not forgotten him .
at the bitterest moment of his lonely despair she came to him , and without waiting to be announced , walked straight into his study .
she found him as he was sitting with his head in both hands .
ai forcé la , she said , walking in with rapid steps and breathing hard with excitement and rapid exercise .
i have heard all !
alexey alexandrovitch !
dear friend !
she went on , warmly squeezing his hand in both of hers and gazing with her fine pensive eyes into his .
alexey alexandrovitch , frowning , got up , and disengaging his hand , moved her a chair .
won t you sit down , countess ?
i m seeing no one because i m unwell , countess , he said , and his lips twitched .
dear friend !
repeated countess lidia ivanovna , never taking her eyes off his , and suddenly her eyebrows rose at the inner corners , describing a triangle on her forehead , her ugly yellow face became still uglier , but alexey alexandrovitch felt that she was sorry for him and was preparing to cry .
and he too was softened ; he snatched her plump hand and proceeded to kiss it .
dear friend !
she said in a voice breaking with emotion .
you ought not to give way to grief .
your sorrow is a great one , but you ought to find consolation .
i am crushed , i am annihilated , i am no longer a man !
said alexey alexandrovitch , letting go her hand , but still gazing into her brimming eyes .
my position is so awful because i can find nowhere , i can not find within me strength to support me .
you will find support ; seek in me , though i beseech you to believe in my friendship , she said , with a sigh .
our support is love , that love that he has vouchsafed us .
his burden is light , she said , with the look of ecstasy alexey alexandrovitch knew so well .
he will be your support and your succor .
although there was in these words a flavor of that sentimental emotion at her own lofty feelings , and that new mystical fervor which had lately gained ground in petersburg , and which seemed to alexey alexandrovitch disproportionate , still it was pleasant to him to hear this now .
i am weak .
i am crushed .
i foresaw nothing , and now i understand nothing .
dear friend , repeated lidia ivanovna .
it s not the loss of what i have not now , it s not that !
pursued alexey alexandrovitch .
i do not grieve for that .
but i can not help feeling humiliated before other people for the position i am placed in .
it is wrong , but i can t help it , i can t help it .
not you it was performed that noble act of forgiveness , at which i was moved to ecstasy , and everyone else too , but he , working within your heart , said countess lidia ivanovna , raising her eyes rapturously , and so you can not be ashamed of your act .
alexey alexandrovitch knitted his brows , and crooking his hands , he cracked his fingers .
one must know all the facts , he said in his thin voice .
a man s strength has its limits , countess , and i have reached my limits .
the whole day i have had to be making arrangements , arrangements about household matters arising ( he emphasized the word ) from my new , solitary position .
the servants , the governess , the accounts
these pinpricks have stabbed me to the heart , and i have not the strength to bear it .
at dinner yesterday , i was almost getting up from the dinner table .
i could not bear the way my son looked at me .
he did not ask me the meaning of it all , but he wanted to ask , and i could not bear the look in his eyes .
he was afraid to look at me , but that is not all alexey alexandrovitch would have referred to the bill that had been brought him , but his voice shook , and he stopped .
that bill on blue paper , for a hat and ribbons , he could not recall without a rush of .
i understand , dear friend , said lidia ivanovna .
i understand it all .
succor and comfort you will find not in me , though i have come only to aid you if i can .
if i could take from off you all these petty , humiliating cares
i understand that a woman s word , a woman s superintendence is needed .
you will intrust it to me ?
silently and gratefully alexey alexandrovitch pressed her hand .
together we will take care of seryozha .
practical affairs are not my strong point .
but i will set to work .
i will be your housekeeper .
don t thank me .
i do it not from myself i can not help thanking you .
but , dear friend , do not give way to the feeling of which you ashamed of what is the christian s highest glory who humbles himself shall be .
and you can not thank me .
you must thank him , and pray to him for succor .
in him alone we find peace , consolation , salvation , and love , she said , and turning her eyes heavenwards , she began praying , as alexey alexandrovitch gathered from her silence .
alexey alexandrovitch listened to her now , and those expressions which had seemed to him , if not distasteful , at least exaggerated , now seemed to him natural and consolatory .
alexey alexandrovitch had disliked this new enthusiastic fervor .
he was a believer , who was interested in religion primarily in its political aspect , and the new doctrine which ventured upon several new interpretations , just because it paved the way to discussion and analysis , was in principle disagreeable to him .
he had hitherto taken up a cold and even antagonistic attitude to this new doctrine , and with countess lidia ivanovna , who had been carried away by it , he had never argued , but by silence had assiduously parried her attempts to provoke him into argument .
now for the first time he heard her words with pleasure , and did not inwardly oppose them .
i am very , very grateful to you , both for your deeds and for your words , he said , when she had finished praying .
countess lidia ivanovna once more pressed both her friend s hands .
now i will enter upon my duties , she said with a smile after a pause , as she wiped away the traces of tears .
i am going to seryozha .
only in the last extremity shall i apply to you .
and she got up and went out .
countess lidia ivanovna went into seryozha s part of the house , and dropping tears on the scared child s cheeks , she told him that his father was a saint and his mother was dead .
countess lidia ivanovna kept her promise .
she did actually take upon herself the care of the organization and management of alexey alexandrovitch s household .
but she had not overstated the case when saying that practical affairs were not her strong point .
all her arrangements had to be modified because they could not be carried out , and they were modified by korney , alexey alexandrovitch s valet , who , though no one was aware of the fact , now managed karenin s household , and quietly and discreetly reported to his master while he was dressing all it was necessary for him to know .
but lidia ivanovna s help was none the less real ; she gave alexey alexandrovitch moral support in the consciousness of her love and respect for him , and still more , as it was soothing to her to believe , in that she almost turned him to is , from an indifferent and apathetic believer she turned him into an ardent and steadfast adherent of the new interpretation of christian doctrine , which had been gaining ground of late in petersburg .
it was easy for alexey alexandrovitch to believe in this teaching .
alexey alexandrovitch , like lidia ivanovna indeed , and others who shared their views , was completely devoid of vividness of imagination , that spiritual faculty in virtue of which the conceptions evoked by the imagination become so vivid that they must needs be in harmony with other conceptions , and with actual fact .
he saw nothing impossible and inconceivable in the idea that death , though existing for unbelievers , did not exist for him , and that , as he was possessed of the most perfect faith , of the measure of which he was himself the judge , therefore there was no sin in his soul , and he was experiencing complete salvation here on earth .
it is true that the erroneousness and shallowness of this conception of his faith was dimly perceptible to alexey alexandrovitch , and he knew that when , without the slightest idea that his forgiveness was the action of a higher power , he had surrendered directly to the feeling of forgiveness , he had felt more happiness than now when he was thinking every instant that christ was in his heart , and that in signing official papers he was doing his will .
but for alexey alexandrovitch it was a necessity to think in that way ; it was such a necessity for him in his humiliation to have some elevated standpoint , however imaginary , from which , looked down upon by all , he could look down on others , that he clung , as to his one salvation , to his delusion of salvation .
the countess lidia ivanovna had , as a very young and sentimental girl , been married to a wealthy man of high rank , an extremely , jovial , and extremely dissipated rake .
two months after marriage her husband abandoned her , and her impassioned protestations of affection he met with a sarcasm and even hostility that people knowing the count s good heart , and seeing no defects in the sentimental lidia , were at a loss to explain .
though they were divorced and lived apart , yet whenever the husband met the wife , he invariably behaved to her with the same malignant irony , the cause of which was incomprehensible .
countess lidia ivanovna had long given up being in love with her husband , but from that time she had never given up being in love with someone .
she was in love with several people at once , both men and women ; she had been in love with almost everyone who had been particularly distinguished in any way .
she was in love with all the new princes and princesses who married into the imperial family ; she had been in love with a high dignitary of the church , a vicar , and a parish priest ; she had been in love with a journalist , three slavophiles , with komissarov , with a minister , a doctor , an english missionary and karenin .
all these passions constantly waning or growing more ardent , did not prevent her from keeping up the most extended and complicated relations with the court and fashionable society .
but from the time that after karenin s trouble she took him under her special protection , from the time that she set to work in karenin s household looking after his welfare , she felt that all her other attachments were not the real thing , and that she was now genuinely in love , and with no one but karenin .
the feeling she now experienced for him seemed to her stronger than any of her former feelings .
analyzing her feeling , and comparing it with former passions , she distinctly perceived that she would not have been in love with komissarov if he had not saved the life of the tsar , that she would not have been in love with if there had been no slavonic question , but that she loved karenin for himself , for his lofty , uncomprehended soul , for the notes of his voice , for his drawling intonation , his weary eyes , his character , and his soft white hands with their swollen veins .
she was not simply overjoyed at meeting him , but she sought in his face signs of the impression she was making on him .
she tried to please him , not by her words only , but in her whole person .
for his sake it was that she now lavished more care on her dress than before .
she caught herself in reveries on what might have been , if she had not been married and he had been free .
she blushed with emotion when he came into the room , she could not repress a smile of rapture when he said anything amiable to her .
for several days now countess lidia ivanovna had been in a state of intense excitement .
she had learned that anna and vronsky were in petersburg .
alexey alexandrovitch must be saved from seeing her , he must be saved even from the torturing knowledge that that awful woman was in the same town with him , and that he might meet her any minute .
lidia ivanovna made inquiries through her friends as to what those , as she called anna and vronsky , intended doing , and she endeavored so to guide every movement of her friend during those days that he could not come across them .
the young adjutant , an acquaintance of vronsky , through whom she obtained her information , and who hoped through countess lidia ivanovna to obtain a concession , told her that they had finished their business and were going away next day .
lidia ivanovna had already begun to calm down , when the next morning a note was brought her , the handwriting of which she recognized with horror .
it was the handwriting of anna karenina .
the envelope was of paper as thick as bark ; on the oblong yellow paper there was a huge monogram , and the letter smelt of agreeable scent .
who brought it ?
a commissionaire from the hotel .
it was some time before countess lidia ivanovna could sit down to read the letter .
her excitement brought on an attack of asthma , to which she was subject .
when she had recovered her composure , she read the following letter in french madame la comtesse , the christian feelings with which your heart is filled give me the , i feel , unpardonable boldness to write to you .
i am miserable at being separated from my son .
i entreat permission to see him once before my departure .
forgive me for recalling myself to your memory .
i apply to you and not to alexey alexandrovitch , simply because i do not wish to cause that generous man to suffer in remembering me .
knowing your friendship for him , i know you will understand me .
could you send seryozha to me , or should i come to the house at some fixed hour , or will you let me know when and where i could see him away from home ?
i do not anticipate a refusal , knowing the magnanimity of him with whom it rests .
you can not conceive the craving i have to see him , and so can not conceive the gratitude your help will arouse in me .
anna everything in this letter exasperated countess lidia ivanovna its contents and the allusion to magnanimity , and especially its free and she .
say that there is no answer , said countess lidia ivanovna , and immediately opening her , she wrote to alexey alexandrovitch that she hoped to see him at one o clock at the levee .
i must talk with you of a grave and painful subject .
there we will arrange where to meet .
best of all at my house , where i will order tea you like .
urgent .
he lays the cross , but he gives the strength to bear it , she added , so as to give him some slight preparation .
countess lidia ivanovna usually wrote some two or three letters a day to alexey alexandrovitch .
she enjoyed that form of communication , which gave opportunity for a refinement and air of mystery not afforded by their personal interviews .
the levee was drawing to a close .
people met as they were going away , and gossiped of the latest news , of the newly bestowed honors and the changes in the positions of the higher functionaries .
if only countess marya borissovna were minister of war , and princess vatkovskaya were , said a , little old man in a uniform , addressing a tall , handsome maid of honor who had questioned him about the new appointments .
and me among the adjutants , said the maid of honor , smiling .
you have an appointment already .
you re over the ecclesiastical department .
and your assistant s karenin .
, prince !
said the little old man to a man who came up to him .
what were you saying of karenin ?
said the prince .
he and putyatov have received the alexander nevsky .
i thought he had it already .
no .
just look at him , said the little old man , pointing with his embroidered hat to karenin in a court uniform with the new red ribbon across his shoulders , standing in the doorway of the hall with an influential member of the imperial council .
pleased and happy as a brass farthing , he added , stopping to shake hands with a handsome gentleman of the bedchamber of colossal proportions .
no ; he s looking older , said the gentleman of the bedchamber .
from overwork .
he s always drawing up projects nowadays .
he won t let a poor devil go nowadays till he s explained it all to him under heads .
looking older , did you say ?
fait des .
i believe countess lidia ivanovna s jealous now of his wife .
oh , come now , please don t say any harm of countess lidia ivanovna .
why , is there any harm in her being in love with karenin ?
but is it true madame karenina s here ?
well , not here in the palace , but in petersburg .
i met her yesterday with alexey vronsky , dessous , bras , in the morsky .
c est un homme qui n a pas the gentleman of the bedchamber was beginning , but he stopped to make room , bowing , for a member of the imperial family to pass .
thus people talked incessantly of alexey alexandrovitch , finding fault with him and laughing at him , while he , blocking up the way of the member of the imperial council he had captured , was explaining to him point by point his new financial project , never interrupting his discourse for an instant for fear he should escape .
almost at the same time that his wife left alexey alexandrovitch there had come to him that bitterest moment in the life of an moment when his upward career comes to a full stop .
this full stop had arrived and everyone perceived it , but alexey alexandrovitch himself was not yet aware that his career was over .
whether it was due to his feud with stremov , or his misfortune with his wife , or simply that alexey alexandrovitch had reached his destined limits , it had become evident to everyone in the course of that year that his career was at an end .
he still filled a position of consequence , he sat on many commissions and committees , but he was a man whose day was over , and from whom nothing was expected .
whatever he said , whatever he proposed , was heard as though it were something long familiar , and the very thing that was not needed .
but alexey alexandrovitch was not aware of this , and , on the contrary , being cut off from direct participation in governmental activity , he saw more clearly than ever the errors and defects in the action of others , and thought it his duty to point out means for their correction .
shortly after his separation from his wife , he began writing his first note on the new judicial procedure , the first of the endless series of notes he was destined to write in the future .
alexey alexandrovitch did not merely fail to observe his hopeless position in the official world , he was not merely free from anxiety on this head , he was positively more satisfied than ever with his own activity .
he that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the lord , how he may please the lord but he that is married careth for the things that are of the world , how he may please his wife , says the apostle paul , and alexey alexandrovitch , who was now guided in every action by scripture , often recalled this text .
it seemed to him that ever since he had been left without a wife , he had in these very projects of reform been serving the lord more zealously than before .
the unmistakable impatience of the member of the council trying to get away from him did not trouble alexey alexandrovitch ; he gave up his exposition only when the member of the council , seizing his chance when one of the imperial family was passing , slipped away from him .
left alone , alexey alexandrovitch looked down , collecting his thoughts , then looked casually about him and walked towards the door , where he hoped to meet countess lidia ivanovna .
and how strong they all are , how sound physically , thought alexey alexandrovitch , looking at the powerfully built gentleman of the bedchamber with his , perfumed whiskers , and at the red neck of the prince , pinched by his tight uniform .
he had to pass them on his way .
truly is it said that all the world is evil , he thought , with another sidelong glance at the calves of the gentleman of the bedchamber .
moving forward deliberately , alexey alexandrovitch bowed with his customary air of weariness and dignity to the gentleman who had been talking about him , and looking towards the door , his eyes sought countess lidia ivanovna .
ah !
alexey alexandrovitch !
said the little old man , with a malicious light in his eyes , at the moment when karenin was on a level with them , and was nodding with a frigid gesture , i haven t congratulated you yet , said the old man , pointing to his newly received ribbon .
thank you , answered alexey alexandrovitch .
what an day today , he added , laying emphasis in his peculiar way on the word .
that they laughed at him he was well aware , but he did not expect anything but hostility from them ; he was used to that by now .
catching sight of the yellow shoulders of lidia ivanovna jutting out above her corset , and her fine pensive eyes bidding him to her , alexey alexandrovitch smiled , revealing untarnished white teeth , and went towards her .
lidia ivanovna s dress had cost her great pains , as indeed all her dresses had done of late .
her aim in dress was now quite the reverse of that she had pursued thirty years before .
then her desire had been to adorn herself with something , and the more adorned the better .
now , on the contrary , she was perforce decked out in a way so inconsistent with her age and her figure , that her one anxiety was to contrive that the contrast between these adornments and her own exterior should not be too appalling .
and as far as alexey alexandrovitch was concerned she succeeded , and was in his eyes attractive .
for him she was the one island not only of goodwill to him , but of love in the midst of the sea of hostility and jeering that surrounded him .
passing through rows of ironical eyes , he was drawn as naturally to her loving glance as a plant to the sun .
i congratulate you , she said to him , her eyes on his ribbon .
suppressing a smile of pleasure , he shrugged his shoulders , closing his eyes , as though to say that that could not be a source of joy to him .
countess lidia ivanovna was very well aware that it was one of his chief sources of satisfaction , though he never admitted it .
how is our angel ?
said countess lidia ivanovna , meaning seryozha .
i can t say i was quite pleased with him , said alexey alexandrovitch , raising his eyebrows and opening his eyes .
and sitnikov is not satisfied with him .
( sitnikov was the tutor to whom seryozha s secular education had been intrusted . )
as i have mentioned to you , there s a sort of coldness in him towards the most important questions which ought to touch the heart of every man and every child alexey alexandrovitch began expounding his views on the sole question that interested him besides the education of his son .
when alexey alexandrovitch with lidia ivanovna s help had been brought back anew to life and activity , he felt it his duty to undertake the education of the son left on his hands .
having never before taken any interest in educational questions , alexey alexandrovitch devoted some time to the theoretical study of the subject .
after reading several books on anthropology , education , and didactics , alexey alexandrovitch drew up a plan of education , and engaging the best tutor in petersburg to superintend it , he set to work , and the subject continually absorbed him .
yes , but the heart .
i see in him his father s heart , and with such a heart a child can not go far wrong , said lidia ivanovna with enthusiasm .
yes , perhaps as for me , i do my duty .
it s all i can do .
you re coming to me , said countess lidia ivanovna , after a pause ; we have to speak of a subject painful for you .
i would give anything to have spared you certain memories , but others are not of the same mind .
i have received a letter from .
is here in petersburg .
alexey alexandrovitch shuddered at the allusion to his wife , but immediately his face assumed the deathlike rigidity which expressed utter helplessness in the matter .
i was expecting it , he said .
countess lidia ivanovna looked at him ecstatically , and tears of rapture at the greatness of his soul came into her eyes .
when alexey alexandrovitch came into the countess lidia ivanovna s snug little boudoir , decorated with old china and hung with portraits , the lady herself had not yet made her appearance .
she was changing her dress .
a cloth was laid on a round table , and on it stood a china tea service and a silver and tea kettle .
alexey alexandrovitch looked idly about at the endless familiar portraits which adorned the room , and sitting down to the table , he opened a new testament lying upon it .
the rustle of the countess s silk skirt drew his attention off .
well now , we can sit quietly , said countess lidia ivanovna , slipping hurriedly with an agitated smile between the table and the sofa , and talk over our tea .
after some words of preparation , countess lidia ivanovna , breathing hard and flushing crimson , gave into alexey alexandrovitch s hands the letter she had received .
after reading the letter , he sat a long while in silence .
i don t think i have the right to refuse her , he said , timidly lifting his eyes .
dear friend , you never see evil in anyone !
on the contrary , i see that all is evil .
but whether it is just his face showed irresolution , and a seeking for counsel , support , and guidance in a matter he did not understand .
no , countess lidia ivanovna interrupted him ; there are limits to everything .
i can understand immorality , she said , not quite truthfully , since she never could understand that which leads women to immorality ; but i don t understand cruelty to whom ?
to you !
how can she stay in the town where you are ?
no , the longer one lives the more one learns .
and i m learning to understand your loftiness and her baseness .
who is to throw a stone ?
said alexey alexandrovitch , unmistakably pleased with the part he had to play .
i have forgiven all , and so i can not deprive her of what is exacted by love in her love for her son but is that love , my friend ?
is it sincere ?
admitting that you have you we the right to work on the feelings of that angel ?
he looks on her as dead .
he prays for her , and beseeches god to have mercy on her sins .
and it is better so .
but now what will he think ?
i had not thought of that , said alexey alexandrovitch , evidently agreeing .
countess lidia ivanovna hid her face in her hands and was silent .
she was praying .
if you ask my advice , she said , having finished her prayer and uncovered her face , i do not advise you to do this .
do you suppose i don t see how you are suffering , how this has torn open your wounds ?
but supposing that , as always , you don t think of yourself , what can it lead to ? fresh suffering for you , to torture for the child .
if there were a trace of humanity left in her , she ought not to wish for it herself .
no , i have no hesitation in saying i advise not , and if you will intrust it to me , i will write to her .
and alexey alexandrovitch consented , and countess lidia ivanovna sent the following letter in french dear madame , to be reminded of you might have results for your son in leading to questions on his part which could not be answered without implanting in the child s soul a spirit of censure towards what should be for him sacred , and therefore i beg you to interpret your husband s refusal in the spirit of christian love .
i pray to almighty god to have mercy on you .
countess lidia this letter attained the secret object which countess lidia ivanovna had concealed from herself .
it wounded anna to the quick .
for his part , alexey alexandrovitch , on returning home from lidia ivanovna s , could not all that day concentrate himself on his usual pursuits , and find that spiritual peace of one saved and believing which he had felt of late .
the thought of his wife , who had so greatly sinned against him , and towards whom he had been so saintly , as countess lidia ivanovna had so justly told him , ought not to have troubled him ; but he was not easy ; he could not understand the book he was reading ; he could not drive away harassing recollections of his relations with her , of the mistake which , as it now seemed , he had made in regard to her .
the memory of how he had received her confession of infidelity on their way home from the races ( especially that he had insisted only on the observance of external decorum , and had not sent a challenge ) tortured him like a remorse .
he was tortured too by the thought of the letter he had written her ; and most of all , his forgiveness , which nobody wanted , and his care of the other man s child made his heart burn with shame and remorse .
and just the same feeling of shame and regret he felt now , as he reviewed all his past with her , recalling the awkward words in which , after long wavering , he had made her an offer .
but how have i been to blame ?
he said to himself .
and this question always excited another question in they felt differently , did their loving and marrying differently , these vronskys and oblonskys these gentlemen of the bedchamber , with their fine calves .
and there passed before his mind a whole series of these mettlesome , vigorous , men , who always and everywhere drew his inquisitive attention in spite of himself .
he tried to dispel these thoughts , he tried to persuade himself that he was not living for this transient life , but for the life of eternity , and that there was peace and love in his heart .
but the fact that he had in this transient , trivial life made , as it seemed to him , a few trivial mistakes tortured him as though the eternal salvation in which he believed had no existence .
but this temptation did not last long , and soon there was reestablished once more in alexey alexandrovitch s soul the peace and the elevation by virtue of which he could forget what he did not want to remember .
well , kapitonitch ?
said seryozha , coming back rosy and from his walk the day before his birthday , and giving his overcoat to the tall old hall porter , who smiled down at the little person from the height of his long figure .
well , has the bandaged clerk been here today ?
did papa see him ?
he saw him .
the minute the chief secretary came out , i announced him , said the hall porter with a wink .
here , i ll take it off .
seryozha !
said the tutor , stopping in the doorway leading to the inner rooms .
take it off yourself .
but seryozha , though he heard his tutor s feeble voice , did not pay attention to it .
he stood keeping hold of the hall porter s belt , and gazing into his face .
well , and did papa do what he wanted for him ?
the hall porter nodded his head affirmatively .
the clerk with his face tied up , who had already been seven times to ask some favor of alexey alexandrovitch , interested both seryozha and the hall porter .
seryozha had come upon him in the hall , and had heard him plaintively beg the hall porter to announce him , saying that he and his children had death staring them in the face .
since then seryozha , having met him a second time in the hall , took great interest in him .
well , was he very glad ?
he asked .
glad ?
i should think so !
almost dancing as he walked away .
and has anything been left ?
asked seryozha , after a pause .
come , sir , said the ; then with a shake of his head he whispered , something from the countess .
seryozha understood at once that what the hall porter was speaking of was a present from countess lidia ivanovna for his birthday .
what do you say ?
where ?
korney took it to your papa .
a fine plaything it must be too !
how big ?
like this ?
rather small , but a fine thing .
a book .
no , a thing .
run along , run along , vassily lukitch is calling you , said the porter , hearing the tutor s steps approaching , and carefully taking away from his belt the little hand in the glove half pulled off , he signed with his head towards the tutor .
vassily lukitch , in a tiny minute !
answered seryozha with that gay and loving smile which always won over the conscientious vassily lukitch .
seryozha was too happy , everything was too delightful for him to be able to help sharing with his friend the porter the family good fortune of which he had heard during his walk in the public gardens from lidia ivanovna s niece .
this piece of good news seemed to him particularly important from its coming at the same time with the gladness of the bandaged clerk and his own gladness at toys having come for him .
it seemed to seryozha that this was a day on which everyone ought to be glad and happy .
you know papa s received the alexander nevsky today ?
to be sure i do !
people have been already to congratulate him .
and is he glad ?
glad at the tsar s gracious favor !
i should think so !
it s a proof he s deserved it , said the porter severely and seriously .
seryozha fell to dreaming , gazing up at the face of the porter , which he had thoroughly studied in every detail , especially the chin that hung down between the gray whiskers , never seen by anyone but seryozha , who saw him only from below .
well , and has your daughter been to see you lately ?
the porter s daughter was a ballet dancer .
when is she to come on ?
they ve their lessons to learn too .
and you ve your lesson , sir ; run along .
on coming into the room , seryozha , instead of sitting down to his lessons , told his tutor of his supposition that what had been brought him must be a machine .
what do you think ?
he inquired .
but vassily lukitch was thinking of nothing but the necessity of learning the grammar lesson for the teacher , who was coming at two .
no , do just tell me , vassily lukitch , he asked suddenly , when he was seated at their work table with the book in his hands , what is greater than the alexander nevsky ?
you know papa s received the alexander nevsky ?
vassily lukitch replied that the vladimir was greater than the alexander nevsky .
and higher still ?
well , highest of all is the andrey pervozvanny .
and higher than the andrey ?
i don t know .
what , you don t know ?
and seryozha , leaning on his elbows , sank into deep meditation .
his meditations were of the most complex and diverse character .
he imagined his father s having suddenly been presented with both the vladimir and the andrey today , and in consequence being much better tempered at his lesson , and dreamed how , when he was grown up , he would himself receive all the orders , and what they might invent higher than the andrey .
directly any higher order were invented , he would win it .
they would make a higher one still , and he would immediately win that too .
the time passed in such meditations , and when the teacher came , the lesson about the adverbs of place and time and manner of action was not ready , and the teacher was not only displeased , but hurt .
this touched seryozha .
he felt he was not to blame for not having learned the lesson ; however much he tried , he was utterly unable to do that .
as long as the teacher was explaining to him , he believed him and seemed to comprehend , but as soon as he was left alone , he was positively unable to recollect and to understand that the short and familiar word suddenly is an adverb of manner of action .
still he was sorry that he had disappointed the teacher .
he chose a moment when the teacher was looking in silence at the book .
mihail ivanitch , when is your birthday ?
he asked all , of a sudden .
you d much better be thinking about your work .
birthdays are of no importance to a rational being .
it s a day like any other on which one has to do one s work .
seryozha looked intently at the teacher , at his scanty beard , at his spectacles , which had slipped down below the ridge on his nose , and fell into so deep a reverie that he heard nothing of what the teacher was explaining to him .
he knew that the teacher did not think what he said ; he felt it from the tone in which it was said .
but why have they all agreed to speak just in the same manner always the dreariest and most useless stuff ?
why does he keep me off ; why doesn t he love me ?
he asked himself mournfully , and could not think of an answer .
after the lesson with the grammar teacher came his father s lesson .
while waiting for his father , seryozha sat at the table playing with a penknife , and fell to dreaming .
among seryozha s favorite occupations was searching for his mother during his walks .
he did not believe in death generally , and in her death in particular , in spite of what lidia ivanovna had told him and his father had confirmed , and it was just because of that , and after he had been told she was dead , that he had begun looking for her when out for a walk .
every woman of full , graceful figure with dark hair was his mother .
at the sight of such a woman such a feeling of tenderness was stirred within him that his breath failed him , and tears came into his eyes .
and he was on the tiptoe of expectation that she would come up to him , would lift her veil .
all her face would be visible , she would smile , she would hug him , he would sniff her fragrance , feel the softness of her arms , and cry with happiness , just as he had one evening lain on her lap while she tickled him , and he laughed and bit her white , fingers .
later , when he accidentally learned from his old nurse that his mother was not dead , and his father and lidia ivanovna had explained to him that she was dead to him because she was wicked ( which he could not possibly believe , because he loved her ) , he went on seeking her and expecting her in the same way .
that day in the public gardens there had been a lady in a lilac veil , whom he had watched with a throbbing heart , believing it to be she as she came towards them along the path .
the lady had not come up to them , but had disappeared somewhere .
that day , more intensely than ever , seryozha felt a rush of love for her , and now , waiting for his father , he forgot everything , and cut all round the edge of the table with his penknife , staring straight before him with sparkling eyes and dreaming of her .
here is your papa !
said vassily lukitch , rousing him .
seryozha jumped up and went up to his father , and kissing his hand , looked at him intently , trying to discover signs of his joy at receiving the alexander nevsky .
did you have a nice walk ?
said alexey alexandrovitch , sitting down in his easy chair , pulling the volume of the old testament to him and opening it .
although alexey alexandrovitch had more than once told seryozha that every christian ought to know scripture history thoroughly , he often referred to the bible himself during the lesson , and seryozha observed this .
yes , it was very nice indeed , papa , said seryozha , sitting sideways on his chair and rocking it , which was forbidden .
i saw nadinka ( nadinka was a niece of lidia ivanovna s who was being brought up in her house ) .
she told me you d been given a new star .
are you glad , papa ?
first of all , don t rock your chair , please , said alexey alexandrovitch .
and secondly , it s not the reward that s precious , but the work itself .
and i could have wished you understood that .
if you now are going to work , to study in order to win a reward , then the work will seem hard to you ; but when you work ( alexey alexandrovitch , as he spoke , thought of how he had been sustained by a sense of duty through the wearisome labor of the morning , consisting of signing one hundred and eighty papers ) , loving your work , you will find your reward in it .
seryozha s eyes , that had been shining with gaiety and tenderness , grew dull and dropped before his father s gaze .
this was the same tone his father always took with him , and seryozha had learned by now to fall in with it .
his father always talked to seryozha though he were addressing some boy of his own imagination , one of those boys that exist in books , utterly unlike himself .
and seryozha always tried with his father to act being the boy .
you understand that , i hope ?
said his father .
yes , papa , answered seryozha , acting the part of the imaginary boy .
the lesson consisted of learning by heart several verses out of the gospel and the repetition of the beginning of the old testament .
the verses from the gospel seryozha knew fairly well , but at the moment when he was saying them he became so absorbed in watching the sharply protruding , bony knobbiness of his father s forehead , that he lost the thread , and he transposed the end of one verse and the beginning of another .
so it was evident to alexey alexandrovitch that he did not understand what he was saying , and that irritated him .
he frowned , and began explaining what seryozha had heard many times before and never could remember , because he understood it too well , just as that suddenly is an adverb of manner of action .
seryozha looked with scared eyes at his father , and could think of nothing but whether his father would make him repeat what he had said , as he sometimes did .
and this thought so alarmed seryozha that he now understood nothing .
but his father did not make him repeat it , and passed on to the lesson out of the old testament .
seryozha recounted the events themselves well enough , but when he had to answer questions as to what certain events prefigured , he knew nothing , though he had already been punished over this lesson .
the passage at which he was utterly unable to say anything , and began fidgeting and cutting the table and swinging his chair , was where he had to repeat the patriarchs before the flood .
he did not know one of them , except enoch , who had been taken up alive to heaven .
last time he had remembered their names , but now he had forgotten them utterly , chiefly because enoch was the personage he liked best in the whole of the old testament , and enoch s translation to heaven was connected in his mind with a whole long train of thought , in which he became absorbed now while he gazed with fascinated eyes at his father s and a button on his waistcoat .
in death , of which they talked to him so often , seryozha disbelieved entirely .
he did not believe that those he loved could die , above all that he himself would die .
that was to him something utterly inconceivable and impossible .
but he had been told that all men die ; he had asked people , indeed , whom he trusted , and they too , had confirmed it ; his old nurse , too , said the same , though reluctantly .
but enoch had not died , and so it followed that everyone did not die .
and why can not anyone else so serve god and be taken alive to heaven ?
thought seryozha .
bad people , that is those seryozha did not like , they might die , but the good might all be like enoch .
well , what are the names of the patriarchs ?
enoch , but you have said that already .
this is bad , seryozha , very bad .
if you don t try to learn what is more necessary than anything for a christian , said his father , getting up , whatever can interest you ?
i am displeased with you , and piotr ignatitch ( this was the most important of his teachers ) is displeased with you
i shall have to punish you .
his father and his teacher were both displeased with seryozha , and he certainly did learn his lessons very badly .
but still it could not be said he was a stupid boy .
on the contrary , he was far cleverer than the boys his teacher held up as examples to seryozha .
in his father s opinion , he did not want to learn what he was taught .
in reality he could not learn that .
he could not , because the claims of his own soul were more binding on him than those claims his father and his teacher made upon him .
those claims were in opposition , and he was in direct conflict with his education .
he was nine years old ; he was a child ; but he knew his own soul , it was precious to him , he guarded it as the eyelid guards the eye , and without the key of love he let no one into his soul .
his teachers complained that he would not learn , while his soul was brimming over with thirst for knowledge .
and he learned from kapitonitch , from his nurse , from nadinka , from vassily lukitch , but not from his teachers .
the spring his father and his teachers reckoned upon to turn their had long dried up at the source , but its waters did their work in another channel .
his father punished seryozha by not letting him go to see nadinka , lidia ivanovna s niece ; but this punishment turned out happily for seryozha .
vassily lukitch was in a good humor , and showed him how to make windmills .
the whole evening passed over this work and in dreaming how to make a windmill on which he could turn at the sails or tying himself on and whirling round .
of his mother seryozha did not think all the evening , but when he had gone to bed , he suddenly remembered her , and prayed in his own words that his mother tomorrow for his birthday might leave off hiding herself and come to him .
vassily lukitch , do you know what i prayed for tonight extra besides the regular things ?
that you might learn your lessons better ?
no .
toys ?
no .
you ll never guess .
a splendid thing ; but it s a secret !
when it comes to pass i ll tell you .
can t you guess !
no , i can t guess .
you tell me , said vassily lukitch with a smile , which was rare with him .
come , lie down , i m putting out the candle .
without the candle i can see better what i see and what i prayed for .
there !
i was almost telling the secret !
said seryozha , laughing gaily .
when the candle was taken away , seryozha heard and felt his mother .
she stood over him , and with loving eyes caressed him .
but then came windmills , a knife , everything began to be mixed up , and he fell asleep .
on arriving in petersburg , vronsky and anna stayed at one of the best hotels ; vronsky apart in a lower story , anna above with her child , its nurse , and her maid , in a large suite of four rooms .
on the day of his arrival vronsky went to his brother s .
there he found his mother , who had come from moscow on business .
his mother and greeted him as usual they asked him about his stay abroad , and talked of their common acquaintances , but did not let drop a single word in allusion to his connection with anna .
his brother came the next morning to see vronsky , and of his own accord asked him about her , and alexey vronsky told him directly that he looked upon his connection with madame karenina as marriage ; that he hoped to arrange a divorce , and then to marry her , and until then he considered her as much a wife as any other wife , and he begged him to tell their mother and his wife so .
if the world disapproves , i don t care , said vronsky ; but if my relations want to be on terms of relationship with me , they will have to be on the same terms with my wife .
the elder brother , who had always a respect for his younger brother s judgment , could not well tell whether he was right or not till the world had decided the question ; for his part he had nothing against it , and with alexey he went up to see anna .
before his brother , as before everyone , vronsky addressed anna with a certain formality , treating her as he might a very intimate friend , but it was understood that his brother knew their real relations , and they talked about anna s going to vronsky s estate .
in spite of all his social experience vronsky was , in consequence of the new position in which he was placed , laboring under a strange misapprehension .
one would have thought he must have understood that society was closed for him and anna ; but now some vague ideas had sprung up in his brain that this was only the case in days , and that now with the rapidity of modern progress ( he had unconsciously become by now a partisan of every sort of progress ) the views of society had changed , and that the question whether they would be received in society was not a foregone conclusion .
of course , he thought , she would not be received at court , but intimate friends can and must look at it in the proper light .
one may sit for several hours at a stretch with one s legs crossed in the same position , if one knows that there s nothing to prevent one s changing one s position ; but if a man knows that he must remain sitting so with crossed legs , then cramps come on , the legs begin to twitch and to strain towards the spot to which one would like to draw them .
this was what vronsky was experiencing in regard to the world .
though at the bottom of his heart he knew that the world was shut on them , he put it to the test whether the world had not changed by now and would not receive them .
but he very quickly perceived that though the world was open for him personally , it was closed for anna .
just as in the game of cat and mouse , the hands raised for him were dropped to bar the way for anna .
one of the first ladies of petersburg society whom vronsky saw was his cousin betsy .
at last !
she greeted him joyfully .
and anna ?
how glad i am !
where are you stopping ?
i can fancy after your delightful travels you must find our poor petersburg horrid .
i can fancy your honeymoon in rome .
how about the divorce ?
is that all over ?
vronsky noticed that betsy s enthusiasm waned when she learned that no divorce had as yet taken place .
people will throw stones at me , i know , she said , but i shall come and see anna ; yes , i shall certainly come .
you won t be here long , i suppose ?
and she did certainly come to see anna the same day , but her tone was not at all the same as in former days .
she unmistakably prided herself on her courage , and wished anna to appreciate the fidelity of her friendship .
she only stayed ten minutes , talking of society gossip , and on leaving she said you ve never told me when the divorce is to be ?
supposing i m ready to fling my cap over the mill , other starchy people will give you the cold shoulder until you re married .
and that s so simple nowadays .
se .
so you re going on friday ?
sorry we shan t see each other again .
from betsy s tone vronsky might have grasped what he had to expect from the world ; but he made another effort in his own family .
his mother he did not reckon upon .
he knew that his mother , who had been so enthusiastic over anna at their first acquaintance , would have no mercy on her now for having ruined her son s career .
but he had more hope of varya , his brother s wife .
he fancied she would not throw stones , and would go simply and directly to see anna , and would receive her in her own house .
the day after his arrival vronsky went to her , and finding her alone , expressed his wishes directly .
you know , alexey , she said after hearing him , how fond i am of you , and how ready i am to do anything for you ; but i have not spoken , because i knew i could be of no use to you and to anna arkadyevna , she said , articulating the name anna arkadyevna with particular care .
don t suppose , please , that i judge her .
never ; perhaps in her place i should have done the same .
i don t and can t enter into that , she said , glancing timidly at his gloomy face .
but one must call things by their names .
you want me to go and see her , to ask her here , and to rehabilitate her in society ; but do understand that i do so .
i have daughters growing up , and i must live in the world for my husband s sake .
well , i m ready to come and see anna arkadyevna she will understand that i can t ask her here , or i should have to do so in such a way that she would not meet people who look at things differently ; that would offend her .
i can t raise her oh , i don t regard her as fallen more than hundreds of women you do receive !
vronsky interrupted her still more gloomily , and he got up in silence , understanding that his s decision was not to be shaken .
alexey !
don t be angry with me .
please understand that i m not to blame , began varya , looking at him with a timid smile .
i m not angry with you , he said still as gloomily ; but i m sorry in two ways .
i m sorry , too , that this means breaking up our not breaking up , at least weakening it .
you will understand that for me , too , it can not be otherwise .
and with that he left her .
vronsky knew that further efforts were useless , and that he had to spend these few days in petersburg as though in a strange town , avoiding every sort of relation with his own old circle in order not to be exposed to the annoyances and humiliations which were so intolerable to him .
one of the most unpleasant features of his position in petersburg was that alexey alexandrovitch and his name seemed to meet him everywhere .
he could not begin to talk of anything without the conversation turning on alexey alexandrovitch ; he could not go anywhere without risk of meeting him .
so at least it seemed to vronsky , just as it seems to a man with a sore finger that he is continually , as though on purpose , grazing his sore finger on everything .
their stay in petersburg was the more painful to vronsky that he perceived all the time a sort of new mood that he could not understand in anna .
at one time she would seem in love with him , and then she would become cold , irritable , and impenetrable .
she was worrying over something , and keeping something back from him , and did not seem to notice the humiliations which poisoned his existence , and for her , with her delicate intuition , must have been still more unbearable .
one of anna s objects in coming back to russia had been to see her son .
from the day she left italy the thought of it had never ceased to agitate her .
and as she got nearer to petersburg , the delight and importance of this meeting grew ever greater in her imagination .
she did not even put to herself the question how to arrange it .
it seemed to her natural and simple to see her son when she should be in the same town with him .
but on her arrival in petersburg she was suddenly made distinctly aware of her present position in society , and she grasped the fact that to arrange this meeting was no easy matter .
she had now been two days in petersburg .
the thought of her son never left her for a single instant , but she had not yet seen him .
to go straight to the house , where she might meet alexey alexandrovitch , that she felt she had no right to do .
she might be refused admittance and insulted .
to write and so enter into relations with her it made her miserable to think of doing ; she could only be at peace when she did not think of her husband .
to get a glimpse of her son out walking , finding out where and when he went out , was not enough for her ; she had so looked forward to this meeting , she had so much she must say to him , she so longed to embrace him , to kiss him .
seryozha s old nurse might be a help to her and show her what to do .
but the nurse was not now living in alexey alexandrovitch s house .
in this uncertainty , and in efforts to find the nurse , two days had slipped by .
hearing of the close intimacy between alexey alexandrovitch and countess lidia ivanovna , anna decided on the third day to write to her a letter , which cost her great pains , and in which she intentionally said that permission to see her son must depend on her husband s generosity .
she knew that if the letter were shown to her husband , he would keep up his character of magnanimity , and would not refuse her request .
the commissionaire who took the letter had brought her back the most cruel and unexpected answer , that there was no answer .
she had never felt so humiliated as at the moment when , sending for the commissionaire , she heard from him the exact account of how he had waited , and how afterwards he had been told there was no answer .
anna felt humiliated , insulted , but she saw that from her point of view countess lidia ivanovna was right .
her suffering was the more poignant that she had to bear it in solitude .
she could not and would not share it with vronsky .
she knew that to him , although he was the primary cause of her distress , the question of her seeing her son would seem a matter of very little consequence .
she knew that he would never be capable of understanding all the depth of her suffering , that for his cool tone at any allusion to it she would begin to hate him .
and she dreaded that more than anything in the world , and so she hid from him everything that related to her son .
spending the whole day at home she considered ways of seeing her son , and had reached a decision to write to her husband .
she was just composing this letter when she was handed the letter from lidia ivanovna .
the countess s silence had subdued and depressed her , but the letter , all that she read between the lines in it , so exasperated her , this malice was so revolting beside her passionate , legitimate tenderness for her son , that she turned against other people and left off blaming herself .
this pretense of feeling !
she said to herself .
they must needs insult me and torture the child , and i am to submit to it !
not on any consideration !
she is worse than i am .
i don t lie , anyway .
and she decided on the spot that next day , seryozha s birthday , she would go straight to her husband s house , bribe or deceive the servants , but at any cost see her son and overturn the hideous deception with which they were encompassing the unhappy child .
she went to a toy shop , bought toys and thought over a plan of action .
she would go early in the morning at eight o clock , when alexey alexandrovitch would be certain not to be up .
she would have money in her hand to give the hall porter and the footman , so that they should let her in , and not raising her veil , she would say that she had come from seryozha s godfather to congratulate him , and that she had been charged to leave the toys at his bedside .
she had prepared everything but the words she should say to her son .
often as she had dreamed of it , she could never think of anything .
the next day , at eight o clock in the morning , anna got out of a hired sledge and rang at the front entrance of her former home .
run and see what s wanted .
some lady , said kapitonitch , who , not yet dressed , in his overcoat and galoshes , had peeped out of the window and seen a lady in a veil standing close up to the door .
his assistant , a lad anna did not know , had no sooner opened the door to her than she came in , and pulling a note out of her muff put it hurriedly into his hand .
alexeitch , she said , and was going on .
scrutinizing the note , the porter s assistant stopped her at the second glass door .
whom do you want ?
he asked .
she did not hear his words and made no answer .
noticing the embarrassment of the unknown lady , kapitonitch went out to her , opened the second door for her , and asked her what she was pleased to want .
from prince skorodumov for sergey alexeitch , she said .
his honor s not up yet , said the porter , looking at her attentively .
anna had not anticipated that the absolutely unchanged hall of the house where she had lived for nine years would so greatly affect her .
memories sweet and painful rose one after another in her heart , and for a moment she forgot what she was here for .
would you kindly wait ?
said kapitonitch , taking off her fur cloak .
as he took off the cloak , kapitonitch glanced at her face , recognized her , and made her a low bow in silence .
please walk in , your excellency , he said to her .
she tried to say something , but her voice refused to utter any sound ; with a guilty and imploring glance at the old man she went with light , swift steps up the stairs .
bent double , and his galoshes catching in the steps , kapitonitch ran after her , trying to overtake her .
the tutor s there ; maybe he s not dressed .
i ll let him know .
anna still mounted the familiar staircase , not understanding what the old man was saying .
this way , to the left , if you please .
excuse its not being tidy .
his honor s in the old parlor now , the hall porter said , panting .
excuse me , wait a little , your excellency ; i ll just see , he said , and overtaking her , he opened the high door and disappeared behind it .
anna stood still waiting .
he s only just awake , said the hall porter , coming out .
and at the very instant the porter said this , anna caught the sound of a childish yawn .
from the sound of this yawn alone she knew her son and seemed to see him living before her eyes .
let me in ; go away !
she said , and went in through the high doorway .
on the right of the door stood a bed , and sitting up in the bed was the boy .
his little body bent forward with his nightshirt unbuttoned , he was stretching and still yawning .
the instant his lips came together they curved into a blissfully sleepy smile , and with that smile he slowly and deliciously rolled back again .
seryozha !
she whispered , going noiselessly up to him .
when she was parted from him , and all this latter time when she had been feeling a fresh rush of love for him , she had pictured him as he was at four years old , when she had loved him most of all .
now he was not even the same as when she had left him ; he was still further from the baby , more grown and thinner .
how thin his face was , how short his hair was !
what long hands !
how he had changed since she left him !
but it was he with his head , his lips , his soft neck and broad little shoulders .
seryozha !
she repeated just in the child s ear .
he raised himself again on his elbow , turned his tangled head from side to side as though looking for something , and opened his eyes .
slowly and inquiringly he looked for several seconds at his mother standing motionless before him , then all at once he smiled a blissful smile , and shutting his eyes , rolled not backwards but towards her into her arms .
seryozha !
my darling boy !
she said , breathing hard and putting her arms round his plump little body .
mother !
he said , wriggling about in her arms so as to touch her hands with different parts of him .
smiling sleepily still with closed eyes , he flung fat little arms round her shoulders , rolled towards her , with the delicious sleepy warmth and fragrance that is only found in children , and began rubbing his face against her neck and shoulders .
i know , he said , opening his eyes ; it s my birthday today .
i knew you d come .
i ll get up directly .
and saying that he dropped asleep .
anna looked at him hungrily ; she saw how he had grown and changed in her absence .
she knew , and did not know , the bare legs so long now , that were thrust out below the quilt , those curls on his neck in which she had so often kissed him .
she touched all this and could say nothing ; tears choked her .
what are you crying for , mother ?
he said , waking completely up .
mother , what are you crying for ?
he cried in a tearful voice .
i won t cry i m crying for joy .
it s so long since i ve seen you .
i won t , i won t , she said , gulping down her tears and turning away .
come , it s time for you to dress now , she added , after a pause , and , never letting go his hands , she sat down by his bedside on the chair , where his clothes were put ready for him .
how do you dress without me ?
how she tried to begin talking simply and cheerfully , but she could not , and again she turned away .
i don t have a cold bath , papa didn t order it .
and you ve not seen vassily lukitch ?
he ll come in soon .
why , you re sitting on my clothes !
and seryozha went off into a peal of laughter .
she looked at him and smiled .
mother , darling , sweet one !
he shouted , flinging himself on her again and hugging her .
it was as though only now , on seeing her smile , he fully grasped what had happened .
i don t want that on , he said , taking off her hat .
and as it were , seeing her afresh without her hat , he fell to kissing her again .
but what did you think about me ?
you didn t think i was dead ?
i never believed it .
you didn t believe it , my sweet ?
i knew , i knew !
he repeated his favorite phrase , and snatching the hand that was stroking his hair , he pressed the open palm to his mouth and kissed it .
meanwhile vassily lukitch had not at first understood who this lady was , and had learned from their conversation that it was no other person than the mother who had left her husband , and whom he had not seen , as he had entered the house after her departure .
he was in doubt whether to go in or not , or whether to communicate with alexey alexandrovitch .
reflecting finally that his duty was to get seryozha up at the hour fixed , and that it was therefore not his business to consider who was there , the mother or anyone else , but simply to do his duty , he finished dressing , went to the door and opened it .
but the embraces of the mother and child , the sound of their voices , and what they were saying , made him change his mind .
he shook his head , and with a sigh he closed the door .
i ll wait another ten minutes , he said to himself , clearing his throat and wiping away tears .
among the servants of the household there was intense excitement all this time .
all had heard that their mistress had come , and that kapitonitch had let her in , and that she was even now in the nursery , and that their master always went in person to the nursery at nine o clock , and every one fully comprehended that it was impossible for the husband and wife to meet , and that they must prevent it .
korney , the valet , going down to the hall porter s room , asked who had let her in , and how it was he had done so , and ascertaining that kapitonitch had admitted her and shown her up , he gave the old man a .
the hall porter was doggedly silent , but when korney told him he ought to be sent away , kapitonitch darted up to him , and waving his hands in korney s face , began oh yes , to be sure you d not have let her in !
after ten years service , and never a word but of kindness , and there you d up and say , be off , go along , get away with you ! oh yes , you re a shrewd one at politics , i dare say !
you don t need to be taught how to swindle the master , and to filch fur coats !
soldier !
said korney contemptuously , and he turned to the nurse who was coming in .
here , what do you think , marya efimovna he let her in without a word to anyone , korney said addressing her .
alexey alexandrovitch will be down go into the nursery !
a pretty business , a pretty business !
said the nurse .
you , korney vassilievitch , you d best keep him some way or other , the master , while i ll run and get her away somehow .
a pretty business !
when the nurse went into the nursery , seryozha was telling his mother how he and nadinka had had a fall in sledging downhill , and had turned over three times .
she was listening to the sound of his voice , watching his face and the play of expression on it , touching his hand , but she did not follow what he was saying .
she must go , she must leave him , was the only thing she was thinking and feeling .
she heard the steps of vassily lukitch coming up to the door and coughing ; she heard , too , the steps of the nurse as she came near ; but she sat like one turned to stone , incapable of beginning to speak or to get up .
mistress , darling !
began the nurse , going up to anna and kissing her hands and shoulders .
god has brought joy indeed to our boy on his birthday .
you aren t changed one bit .
oh , nurse dear , i didn t know you were in the house , said anna , rousing herself for a moment .
i m not living here , i m living with my daughter .
i came for the birthday , anna arkadyevna , darling !
the nurse suddenly burst into tears , and began kissing her hand again .
seryozha , with radiant eyes and smiles , holding his mother by one hand and his nurse by the other , pattered on the rug with his fat little bare feet .
the tenderness shown by his beloved nurse to his mother threw him into an ecstasy .
mother !
she often comes to see me , and when she comes he was beginning , but he stopped , noticing that the nurse was saying something in a whisper to his mother , and that in his mother s face there was a look of dread and something like shame , which was so strangely unbecoming to her .
she went up to him .
my sweet !
she said .
she could not say , but the expression on her face said it , and he understood .
darling , darling kootik !
she used the name by which she had called him when he was little , you won t forget me ?
you but she could not say more .
how often afterwards she thought of words she might have said .
but now she did not know how to say it , and could say nothing .
but seryozha knew all she wanted to say to him .
he understood that she was unhappy and loved him .
he understood even what the nurse had whispered .
he had caught the words always at nine o clock , and he knew that this was said of his father , and that his father and mother could not meet .
that he understood , but one thing he could not there should be a look of dread and shame in her face ?
she was not in fault , but she was afraid of him and ashamed of something .
he would have liked to put a question that would have set at rest this doubt , but he did not dare ; he saw that she was miserable , and he felt for her .
silently he pressed close to her and whispered , don t go yet .
he won t come just yet .
the mother held him away from her to see what he was thinking , what to say to him , and in his frightened face she read not only that he was speaking of his father , but , as it were , asking her what he ought to think about his father .
seryozha , my darling , she said , love him ; he s better and kinder than i am , and i have done him wrong .
when you grow up you will judge .
there s no one better than you !
he cried in despair through his tears , and , clutching her by the shoulders , he began squeezing her with all his force to him , his arms trembling with the strain .
my sweet , my little one !
said anna , and she cried as weakly and childishly as he .
at that moment the door opened .
vassily lukitch came in .
at the other door there was the sound of steps , and the nurse in a scared whisper said , he s coming , and gave anna her hat .
seryozha sank onto the bed and sobbed , hiding his face in his hands .
anna removed his hands , once more kissed his wet face , and with rapid steps went to the door .
alexey alexandrovitch walked in , meeting her .
seeing her , he stopped short and bowed his head .
although she had just said he was better and kinder than she , in the rapid glance she flung at him , taking in his whole figure in all its details , feelings of repulsion and hatred for him and jealousy over her son took possession of her .
with a swift gesture she put down her veil , and , quickening her pace , almost ran out of the room .
she had not time to undo , and so carried back with her , the parcel of toys she had chosen the day before in a toy shop with such love and sorrow .
as intensely as anna had longed to see her son , and long as she had been thinking of it and preparing herself for it , she had not in the least expected that seeing him would affect her so deeply .
on getting back to her lonely rooms in the hotel she could not for a long while understand why she was there .
yes , it s all over , and i am again alone , she said to herself , and without taking off her hat she sat down in a low chair by the hearth .
fixing her eyes on a bronze clock standing on a table between the windows , she tried to think .
the french maid brought from abroad came in to suggest she should dress .
she gazed at her wonderingly and said , presently .
a footman offered her coffee .
later on , she said .
the italian nurse , after having taken the baby out in her best , came in with her , and brought her to anna .
the plump , little baby , on seeing her mother , as she always did , held out her fat little hands , and with a smile on her toothless mouth , began , like a fish with a float , bobbing her fingers up and down the starched folds of her embroidered skirt , making them rustle .
it was impossible not to smile , not to kiss the baby , impossible not to hold out a finger for her to clutch , crowing and prancing all over ; impossible not to offer her a lip which she sucked into her little mouth by way of a kiss .
and all this anna did , and took her in her arms and made her dance , and kissed her fresh little cheek and bare little elbows ; but at the sight of this child it was plainer than ever to her that the feeling she had for her could not be called love in comparison with what she felt for seryozha .
everything in this baby was charming , but for some reason all this did not go deep to her heart .
on her first child , though the child of an unloved father , had been concentrated all the love that had never found satisfaction .
her baby girl had been born in the most painful circumstances and had not had a hundredth part of the care and thought which had been concentrated on her first child .
besides , in the little girl everything was still in the future , while seryozha was by now almost a personality , and a personality dearly loved .
in him there was a conflict of thought and feeling ; he understood her , he loved her , he judged her , she thought , recalling his words and his eyes .
and she was physically only but from him , and it was impossible to set this right .
she gave the baby back to the nurse , let her go , and opened the locket in which there was seryozha s portrait when he was almost of the same age as the girl .
she got up , and , taking off her hat , took up from a little table an album in which there were photographs of her son at different ages .
she wanted to compare them , and began taking them out of the album .
she took them all out except one , the latest and best photograph .
in it he was in a white smock , sitting astride a chair , with frowning eyes and smiling lips .
it was his best , most characteristic expression .
with her little supple hands , her white , delicate fingers , that moved with a peculiar intensity today , she pulled at a corner of the photograph , but the photograph had caught somewhere , and she could not get it out .
there was no paper knife on the table , and so , pulling out the photograph that was next to her son s ( it was a photograph of vronsky taken at rome in a round hat and with long hair ) , she used it to push out her son s photograph .
oh , here is he !
she said , glancing at the portrait of vronsky , and she suddenly recalled that he was the cause of her present misery .
she had not once thought of him all the morning .
but now , coming all at once upon that manly , noble face , so familiar and so dear to her , she felt a sudden rush of love for him .
but where is he ?
how is it he leaves me alone in my misery ?
she thought all at once with a feeling of reproach , forgetting she had herself kept from him everything concerning her son .
she sent to ask him to come to her immediately ; with a throbbing heart she awaited him , rehearsing to herself the words in which she would tell him all , and the expressions of love with which he would console her .
the messenger returned with the answer that he had a visitor with him , but that he would come immediately , and that he asked whether she would let him bring with him prince yashvin , who had just arrived in petersburg .
he s not coming alone , and since dinner yesterday he has not seen me , she thought ; he s not coming so that i could tell him everything , but coming with yashvin .
and all at once a strange idea came to her what if he had ceased to love her ?
and going over the events of the last few days , it seemed to her that she saw in everything a confirmation of this terrible idea .
the fact that he had not dined at home yesterday , and the fact that he had insisted on their taking separate sets of rooms in petersburg , and that even now he was not coming to her alone , as though he were trying to avoid meeting her face to face .
but he ought to tell me so .
i must know that it is so .
if i knew it , then i know what i should do , she said to herself , utterly unable to picture to herself the position she would be in if she were convinced of his not caring for her .
she thought he had ceased to love her , she felt close upon despair , and consequently she felt exceptionally alert .
she rang for her maid and went to her dressing room .
as she dressed , she took more care over her appearance than she had done all those days , as though he might , if he had grown cold to her , fall in love with her again because she had dressed and arranged her hair in the way most becoming to her .
she heard the bell ring before she was ready .
when she went into the drawing room it was not he , but yashvin , who met her eyes .
vronsky was looking through the photographs of her son , which she had forgotten on the table , and he made no haste to look round at her .
we have met already , she said , putting her little hand into the huge hand of yashvin , whose bashfulness was so queerly out of keeping with his immense frame and coarse face .
we met last year at the races .
give them to me , she said , with a rapid movement snatching from vronsky the photographs of her son , and glancing significantly at him with flashing eyes .
were the races good this year ?
instead of them i saw the races in the corso in rome .
but you don t care for life abroad , she said with a cordial smile .
i know you and all your tastes , though i have seen so little of you .
i m awfully sorry for that , for my tastes are mostly bad , said yashvin , gnawing at his left mustache .
having talked a little while , and noticing that vronsky glanced at the clock , yashvin asked her whether she would be staying much longer in petersburg , and unbending his huge figure reached after his cap .
not long , i think , she said hesitatingly , glancing at vronsky .
so then we shan t meet again ?
come and dine with me , said anna resolutely , angry it seemed with herself for her embarrassment , but flushing as she always did when she defined her position before a fresh person .
the dinner here is not good , but at least you will see him .
there is no one of his old friends in the regiment alexey cares for as he does for you .
delighted , said yashvin with a smile , from which vronsky could see that he liked anna very much .
yashvin said and went away ; vronsky stayed behind .
are you going too ?
she said to him .
i m late already , he answered .
run along !
i ll catch you up in a moment , he called to yashvin .
she took him by the hand , and without taking her eyes off him , gazed at him while she ransacked her mind for the words to say that would keep him .
wait a minute , there s something i want to say to you , and taking his broad hand she pressed it on her neck .
oh , was it right my asking him to dinner ?
you did quite right , he said with a serene smile that showed his even teeth , and he kissed her hand .
alexey , you have not changed to me ?
she said , pressing his hand in both of hers .
alexey , i am miserable here .
when are we going away ?
soon , soon .
you wouldn t believe how disagreeable our way of living here is to me too , he said , and he drew away his hand .
well , go , go !
she said in a tone of offense , and she walked quickly away from him .
when vronsky returned home , anna was not yet home .
soon after he had left , some lady , so they told him , had come to see her , and she had gone out with her .
that she had gone out without leaving word where she was going , that she had not yet come back , and that all the morning she had been going about somewhere without a word to this , together with the strange look of excitement in her face in the morning , and the recollection of the hostile tone with which she had before yashvin almost snatched her son s photographs out of his hands , made him serious .
he decided he absolutely must speak openly with her .
and he waited for her in her drawing room .
but anna did not return alone , but brought with her her old unmarried aunt , princess oblonskaya .
this was the lady who had come in the morning , and with whom anna had gone out shopping .
anna appeared not to notice vronsky s worried and inquiring expression , and began a lively account of her morning s shopping .
he saw that there was something working within her ; in her flashing eyes , when they rested for a moment on him , there was an intense concentration , and in her words and movements there was that nervous rapidity and grace which , during the early period of their intimacy , had so fascinated him , but which now so disturbed and alarmed him .
the dinner was laid for four .
all were gathered together and about to go into the little dining room when tushkevitch made his appearance with a message from princess betsy .
princess betsy begged her to excuse her not having come to say ; she had been indisposed , but begged anna to come to her between six and nine o clock .
vronsky glanced at anna at the precise limit of time , so suggestive of steps having been taken that she should meet no one ; but anna appeared not to notice it .
very sorry that i can t come just between six and nine , she said with a faint smile .
the princess will be very sorry .
and so am i .
you re going , no doubt , to hear patti ?
said tushkevitch .
patti ?
you suggest the idea to me .
i would go if it were possible to get a box .
i can get one , tushkevitch offered his services .
i should be very , very grateful to you , said anna .
but won t you dine with us ?
vronsky gave a hardly perceptible shrug .
he was at a complete loss to understand what anna was about .
what had she brought the old princess oblonskaya home for , what had she made tushkevitch stay to dinner for , and , most amazing of all , why was she sending him for a box ?
could she possibly think in her position of going to patti s benefit , where all the circle of her acquaintances would be ?
he looked at her with serious eyes , but she responded with that defiant , , look , the meaning of which he could not comprehend .
at dinner anna was in aggressively high almost flirted both with tushkevitch and with yashvin .
when they got up from dinner and tushkevitch had gone to get a box at the opera , yashvin went to smoke , and vronsky went down with him to his own rooms .
after sitting there for some time he ran upstairs .
anna was already dressed in a gown of light silk and velvet that she had had made in paris , and with costly white lace on her head , framing her face , and particularly becoming , showing up her dazzling beauty .
are you really going to the theater ?
he said , trying not to look at her .
why do you ask with such alarm ?
she said , wounded again at his not looking at her .
why shouldn t i go ?
she appeared not to understand the motive of his words .
oh , of course , there s no reason whatever , he said , frowning .
that s just what i say , she said , willfully refusing to see the irony of his tone , and quietly turning back her long , perfumed glove .
anna , for god s sake !
what is the matter with you ?
he said , appealing to her exactly as once her husband had done .
i don t understand what you are asking .
you know that it s out of the question to go .
why so ?
i m not going alone .
princess varvara has gone to dress , she is going with me .
he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity and despair .
but do you mean to say you don t know ?
he began .
but i don t care to know !
she almost shrieked .
i don t care to .
do i regret what i have done ?
no , no , no !
if it were all to do again from the beginning , it would be the same .
for us , for you and for me , there is only one thing that matters , whether we love each other .
other people we need not consider .
why are we living here apart and not seeing each other ?
why can t i go ?
i love you , and i don t care for anything , she said in russian , glancing at him with a peculiar gleam in her eyes that he could not understand .
if you have not changed to me , why don t you look at me ?
he looked at her .
he saw all the beauty of her face and full dress , always so becoming to her .
but now her beauty and elegance were just what irritated him .
my feeling can not change , you know , but i beg you , i entreat you , he said again in french , with a note of tender supplication in his voice , but with coldness in his eyes .
she did not hear his words , but she saw the coldness of his eyes , and answered with irritation and i beg you to explain why i should not go .
because it might cause you he hesitated .
i don t understand .
yashvin est pas , and princess varvara is no worse than others .
oh , here she is !
vronsky for the first time experienced a feeling of anger against anna , almost a hatred for her willfully refusing to understand her own position .
this feeling was aggravated by his being unable to tell her plainly the cause of his anger .
if he had told her directly what he was thinking , he would have said in that dress , with a princess only too well known to everyone , to show yourself at the theater is equivalent not merely to acknowledging your position as a fallen woman , but is flinging down a challenge to society , that is to say , cutting yourself off from it forever .
he could not say that to her .
but how can she fail to see it , and what is going on in her ?
he said to himself .
he felt at the same time that his respect for her was diminished while his sense of her beauty was intensified .
he went back scowling to his rooms , and sitting down beside yashvin , who , with his long legs stretched out on a chair , was drinking brandy and seltzer water , he ordered a glass of the same for himself .
you were talking of lankovsky s powerful .
that s a fine horse , and i would advise you to buy him , said yashvin , glancing at his comrade s gloomy face .
his aren t quite , but the legs and couldn t wish for anything better .
i think i will take him , answered vronsky .
their conversation about horses interested him , but he did not for an instant forget anna , and could not help listening to the sound of steps in the corridor and looking at the clock on the chimney piece .
anna arkadyevna gave orders to announce that she has gone to the theater .
yashvin , tipping another glass of brandy into the bubbling water , drank it and got up , buttoning his coat .
well , let s go , he said , faintly smiling under his mustache , and showing by this smile that he knew the cause of vronsky s gloominess , and did not attach any significance to it .
i m not going , vronsky answered gloomily .
well , i must , i promised to .
, then .
if you do , come to the stalls ; you can take kruzin s stall , added yashvin as he went out .
no , i m busy .
a wife is a care , but it s worse when she s not a wife , thought yashvin , as he walked out of the hotel .
vronsky , left alone , got up from his chair and began pacing up and down the room .
and what s today ?
the fourth night yegor and his wife are there , and my mother , most likely .
of course all petersburg s there .
now she s gone in , taken off her cloak and come into the light .
tushkevitch , yashvin , princess varvara , he pictured them to himself what about me ?
either that i m frightened or have given up to tushkevitch the right to protect her ?
from every point of , stupid !
and why is she putting me in such a position ?
he said with a gesture of despair .
with that gesture he knocked against the table , on which there was standing the seltzer water and the decanter of brandy , and almost upset it .
he tried to catch it , let it slip , and angrily kicked the table over and rang .
if you care to be in my service , he said to the valet who came in , you had better remember your duties .
this shouldn t be here .
you ought to have cleared away .
the valet , conscious of his own innocence , would have defended himself , but glancing at his master , he saw from his face that the only thing to do was to be silent , and hurriedly threading his way in and out , dropped down on the carpet and began gathering up the whole and broken glasses and bottles .
that s not your duty ; send the waiter to clear away , and get my dress coat out .
vronsky went into the theater at eight .
the performance was in full swing .
the little old , recognizing vronsky as he helped him off with his fur coat , called him your excellency , and suggested he should not take a number but should simply call fyodor .
in the brightly lighted corridor there was no one but the and two attendants with fur cloaks on their arms listening at the doors .
through the closed doors came the sounds of the discreet accompaniment of the orchestra , and a single female voice rendering distinctly a musical phrase .
the door opened to let the slip through , and the phrase drawing to the end reached vronsky s hearing clearly .
but the doors were closed again at once , and vronsky did not hear the end of the phrase and the cadence of the accompaniment , though he knew from the thunder of applause that it was over .
when he entered the hall , brilliantly lighted with chandeliers and gas jets , the noise was still going on .
on the stage the singer , bowing and smiling , with bare shoulders flashing with diamonds , was , with the help of the tenor who had given her his arm , gathering up the bouquets that were flying awkwardly over the footlights .
then she went up to a gentleman with glossy pomaded hair parted down the center , who was stretching across the footlights holding out something to her , and all the public in the stalls as well as in the boxes was in excitement , craning forward , shouting and clapping .
the conductor in his high chair assisted in passing the offering , and straightened his white tie .
vronsky walked into the middle of the stalls , and , standing still , began looking about him .
that day less than ever was his attention turned upon the familiar , habitual surroundings , the stage , the noise , all the familiar , uninteresting , particolored herd of spectators in the packed theater .
there were , as always , the same ladies of some sort with officers of some sort in the back of the boxes ; the same gaily dressed knows uniforms and black coats ; the same dirty crowd in the upper gallery ; and among the crowd , in the boxes and in the front rows , were some forty of the people .
and to those oases vronsky at once directed his attention , and with them he entered at once into relation .
the act was over when he went in , and so he did not go straight to his brother s box , but going up to the first row of stalls stopped at the footlights with serpuhovskoy , who , standing with one knee raised and his heel on the footlights , caught sight of him in the distance and beckoned to him , smiling .
vronsky had not yet seen anna .
he purposely avoided looking in her direction .
but he knew by the direction of people s eyes where she was .
he looked round discreetly , but he was not seeking her ; expecting the worst , his eyes sought for alexey alexandrovitch .
to his relief alexey alexandrovitch was not in the theater that evening .
how little of the military man there is left in you !
serpuhovskoy was saying to him .
a diplomat , an artist , something of that sort , one would say .
yes , it was like going back home when i put on a black coat , answered vronsky , smiling and slowly taking out his opera glass .
well , i ll own i envy you there .
when i come back from abroad and put on this , he touched his epaulets , i regret my freedom .
serpuhovskoy had long given up all hope of vronsky s career , but he liked him as before , and was now particularly cordial to him .
what a pity you were not in time for the first act !
vronsky , listening with one ear , moved his opera glass from the stalls and scanned the boxes .
near a lady in a turban and a bald old man , who seemed to wave angrily in the moving opera glass , vronsky suddenly caught sight of anna s head , proud , strikingly beautiful , and smiling in the frame of lace .
she was in the fifth box , twenty paces from him .
she was sitting in front , and slightly turning , was saying something to yashvin .
the setting of her head on her handsome , broad shoulders , and the restrained excitement and brilliance of her eyes and her whole face reminded him of her just as he had seen her at the ball in moscow .
but he felt utterly different towards her beauty now .
in his feeling for her now there was no element of mystery , and so her beauty , though it attracted him even more intensely than before , gave him now a sense of injury .
she was not looking in his direction , but vronsky felt that she had seen him already .
when vronsky turned the opera glass again in that direction , he noticed that princess varvara was particularly red , and kept laughing unnaturally and looking round at the next box .
anna , folding her fan and tapping it on the red velvet , was gazing away and did not see , and obviously did not wish to see , what was taking place in the next box .
yashvin s face wore the expression which was common when he was losing at cards .
scowling , he sucked the left end of his mustache further and further into his mouth , and cast sidelong glances at the next box .
in that box on the left were the kartasovs .
vronsky knew them , and knew that anna was acquainted with them .
madame kartasova , a thin little woman , was standing up in her box , and , her back turned upon anna , she was putting on a mantle that her husband was holding for her .
her face was pale and angry , and she was talking excitedly .
kartasov , a fat , bald man , was continually looking round at anna , while he attempted to soothe his wife .
when the wife had gone out , the husband lingered a long while , and tried to catch anna s eye , obviously anxious to bow to her .
but anna , with unmistakable intention , avoided noticing him , and talked to yashvin , whose cropped head was bent down to her .
kartasov went out without making his salutation , and the box was left empty .
vronsky could not understand exactly what had passed between the kartasovs and anna , but he saw that something humiliating for anna had happened .
he knew this both from what he had seen , and most of all from the face of anna , who , he could see , was taxing every nerve to carry through the part she had taken up .
and in maintaining this attitude of external composure she was completely successful .
anyone who did not know her and her circle , who had not heard all the utterances of the women expressive of commiseration , indignation , and amazement , that she should show herself in society , and show herself so conspicuously with her lace and her beauty , would have admired the serenity and loveliness of this woman without a suspicion that she was undergoing the sensations of a man in the stocks .
knowing that something had happened , but not knowing precisely what , vronsky felt a thrill of agonizing anxiety , and hoping to find out something , he went towards his brother s box .
purposely choosing the way round furthest from anna s box , he jostled as he came out against the colonel of his old regiment talking to two acquaintances .
vronsky heard the name of madame karenina , and noticed how the colonel hastened to address vronsky loudly by name , with a meaning glance at his companions .
ah , vronsky !
when are you coming to the regiment ?
we can t let you off without a supper .
you re one of the old set , said the colonel of his regiment .
i can t stop , awfully sorry , another time , said vronsky , and he ran upstairs towards his brother s box .
the old countess , vronsky s mother , with her curls , was in his brother s box .
varya with the young princess sorokina met him in the corridor .
leaving the princess sorokina with her mother , varya held out her hand to her , and began immediately to speak of what interested him .
she was more excited than he had ever seen her .
i think it s mean and hateful , and madame kartasova had no right to do it .
madame karenina she began .
but what is it ?
i don t know .
what ?
you ve not heard ?
you know i should be the last person to hear of it .
there isn t a more spiteful creature than that madame kartasova !
but what did she do ?
my husband told me she has insulted madame karenina .
her husband began talking to her across the box , and madame kartasova made a scene .
she said something aloud , he says , something insulting , and went away .
count , your maman is asking for you , said the young princess sorokina , peeping out of the door of the box .
i ve been expecting you all the while , said his mother , smiling sarcastically .
you were nowhere to be seen .
her son saw that she could not suppress a smile of delight .
good evening , maman .
i have come to you , he said coldly .
why aren t you going to la cour à madame karenina ? she went on , when princess sorokina had moved away .
fait sensation .
on oublie la patti pour .
maman , i have asked you not to say anything to me of that , he answered , scowling .
i m only saying what everyone s saying .
vronsky made no reply , and saying a few words to princess sorokina , he went away .
at the door he met his brother .
ah , alexey !
said his brother .
how disgusting !
idiot of a woman , nothing else
i wanted to go straight to her .
let s go together .
vronsky did not hear him .
with rapid steps he went downstairs ; he felt that he must do something , but he did not know what .
anger with her for having put herself and him in such a false position , together with pity for her suffering , filled his heart .
he went down , and made straight for anna s box .
at her box stood stremov , talking to her .
there are no more tenors .
moule en est brisé ! vronsky bowed to her and stopped to greet stremov .
you came in late , i think , and have missed the best song , anna said to vronsky , glancing ironically , he thought , at him .
i am a poor judge of music , he said , looking sternly at her .
like prince yashvin , she said smiling , who considers that patti sings too loud .
thank you , she said , her little hand in its long glove taking the playbill vronsky picked up , and suddenly at that instant her lovely face quivered .
she got up and went into the interior of the box .
noticing in the next act that her box was empty , vronsky , rousing indignant hushes in the silent audience , went out in the middle of a solo and drove home .
anna was already at home .
when vronsky went up to her , she was in the same dress as she had worn at the theater .
she was sitting in the first armchair against the wall , looking straight before her .
she looked at him , and at once resumed her former position .
anna , he said .
you , you are to blame for everything !
she cried , with tears of despair and hatred in her voice , getting up .
i begged , i implored you not to go , i knew it would be unpleasant unpleasant !
she hideous !
as long as i live i shall never forget it .
she said it was a disgrace to sit beside me .
a silly woman s chatter , he said but why risk it , why provoke ?
i hate your calm .
you ought not to have brought me to this .
if you had loved me anna !
how does the question of my love come in ?
oh , if you loved me , as i love , if you were tortured as i am !
she said , looking at him with an expression of terror .
he was sorry for her , and angry notwithstanding .
he assured her of his love because he saw that this was the only means of soothing her , and he did not reproach her in words , but in his heart he reproached her .
and the asseverations of his love , which seemed to him so vulgar that he was ashamed to utter them , she drank in eagerly , and gradually became calmer .
the next day , completely reconciled , they left for the country .
darya alexandrovna spent the summer with her children at pokrovskoe , at her sister kitty levin s .
the house on her own estate was quite in ruins , and levin and his wife had persuaded her to spend the summer with them .
stepan arkadyevitch greatly approved of the arrangement .
he said he was very sorry his official duties prevented him from spending the summer in the country with his family , which would have been the greatest happiness for him ; and remaining in moscow , he came down to the country from time to time for a day or two .
besides the oblonskys , with all their children and their governess , the old princess too came to stay that summer with the levins , as she considered it her duty to watch over her inexperienced daughter in her .
moreover , varenka , kitty s friend abroad , kept her promise to come to kitty when she was married , and stayed with her friend .
all of these were friends or relations of levin s wife .
and though he liked them all , he rather regretted his own levin world and ways , which was smothered by this influx of the shtcherbatsky element , as he called it to himself .
of his own relations there stayed with him only sergey ivanovitch , but he too was a man of the koznishev and not the levin stamp , so that the levin spirit was utterly obliterated .
in the levins house , so long deserted , there were now so many people that almost all the rooms were occupied , and almost every day it happened that the old princess , sitting down to table , counted them all over , and put the thirteenth grandson or granddaughter at a separate table .
and kitty , with her careful housekeeping , had no little trouble to get all the chickens , turkeys , and geese , of which so many were needed to satisfy the summer appetites of the visitors and children .
the whole family were sitting at dinner .
dolly s children , with their governess and varenka , were making plans for going to look for mushrooms .
sergey ivanovitch , who was looked up to by all the party for his intellect and learning , with a respect that almost amounted to awe , surprised everyone by joining in the conversation about mushrooms .
take me with you .
i am very fond of picking mushrooms , he said , looking at varenka ; i think it s a very nice occupation .
oh , we shall be delighted , answered varenka , coloring a little .
kitty exchanged meaningful glances with dolly .
the proposal of the learned and intellectual sergey ivanovitch to go looking for mushrooms with varenka confirmed certain theories of kitty s with which her mind had been very busy of late .
she made haste to address some remark to her mother , so that her look should not be noticed .
after dinner sergey ivanovitch sat with his cup of coffee at the window , and while he took part in a conversation he had begun with his brother , he watched the door through which the children would start on the expedition .
levin was sitting in the window near his brother .
kitty stood beside her husband , evidently awaiting the end of a conversation that had no interest for her , in order to tell him something .
you have changed in many respects since your marriage , and for the better , said sergey ivanovitch , smiling to kitty , and obviously little interested in the conversation , but you have remained true to your passion for defending the most paradoxical theories .
katya , it s not good for you to stand , her husband said to her , putting a chair for her and looking significantly at her .
oh , and there s no time either , added sergey ivanovitch , seeing the children running out .
at the head of them all tanya galloped sideways , in her stockings , and waving a basket and sergey ivanovitch s hat , she ran straight up to him .
boldly running up to sergey ivanovitch with shining eyes , so like her father s fine eyes , she handed him his hat and made as though she would put it on for him , softening her freedom by a shy and friendly smile .
varenka s waiting , she said , carefully putting his hat on , seeing from sergey ivanovitch s smile that she might do so .
varenka was standing at the door , dressed in a yellow print gown , with a white kerchief on her head .
i m coming , i m coming , varvara andreevna , said sergey ivanovitch , finishing his cup of coffee , and putting into their separate pockets his handkerchief and .
and how sweet my varenka is !
eh ?
said kitty to her husband , as soon as sergey ivanovitch rose .
she spoke so that sergey ivanovitch could hear , and it was clear that she meant him to do so .
and how she a refined beauty !
varenka !
kitty shouted .
shall you be in the mill copse ?
we ll come out to you .
you certainly forget your condition , kitty , said the old princess , hurriedly coming out at the door .
you mustn t shout like that .
varenka , hearing kitty s voice and her mother s reprimand , went with light , rapid steps up to kitty .
the rapidity of her movement , her flushed and eager face , everything betrayed that something out of the common was going on in her .
kitty knew what this was , and had been watching her intently .
she called varenka at that moment merely in order mentally to give her a blessing for the important event which , as kitty fancied , was bound to come to pass that day after dinner in the wood .
varenka , i should be very happy if a certain something were to happen , she whispered as she kissed her .
and are you coming with us ?
varenka said to levin in confusion , pretending not to have heard what had been said .
i am coming , but only as far as the , and there i shall stop .
why , what do you want there ?
said kitty .
i must go to have a look at the new wagons , and to check the invoice , said levin ; and where will you be ?
on the terrace .
on the terrace were assembled all the ladies of the party .
they always liked sitting there after dinner , and that day they had work to do there too .
besides the sewing and knitting of baby clothes , with which all of them were busy , that afternoon jam was being made on the terrace by a method new to agafea mihalovna , without the addition of water .
kitty had introduced this new method , which had been in use in her home .
agafea mihalovna , to whom the task of had always been intrusted , considering that what had been done in the levin household could not be amiss , had nevertheless put water with the strawberries , maintaining that the jam could not be made without it .
she had been caught in the act , and was now making jam before everyone , and it was to be proved to her conclusively that jam could be very well made without water .
agafea mihalovna , her face heated and angry , her hair untidy , and her thin arms bare to the elbows , was turning the over the charcoal stove , looking darkly at the raspberries and devoutly hoping they would stick and not cook properly .
the princess , conscious that agafea mihalovna s wrath must be chiefly directed against her , as the person responsible for the raspberry , tried to appear to be absorbed in other things and not interested in the jam , talked of other matters , but cast stealthy glances in the direction of the stove .
i always buy my maids dresses myself , of some cheap material , the princess said , continuing the previous conversation .
isn t it time to skim it , my dear ?
she added , addressing agafea mihalovna .
there s not the slightest need for you to do it , and it s hot for you , she said , stopping kitty .
i ll do it , said dolly , and getting up , she carefully passed the spoon over the frothing sugar , and from time to time shook off the clinging jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with scum and syrup .
how they ll enjoy this at !
she thought of her children , remembering how she herself as a child had wondered how it was the people did not eat what was best of scum of the jam .
stiva says it s much better to give money .
dolly took up meanwhile the weighty subject under discussion , what presents should be made to servants .
but money s out of the question !
the princess and kitty exclaimed with one voice .
they appreciate a present well , last year , for instance , i bought our matrona semyenovna , not a poplin , but something of that sort , said the princess .
i remember she was wearing it on your nameday .
a charming simple and refined , should have liked it myself , if she hadn t had it .
something like varenka s .
so pretty and inexpensive .
well , now i think it s done , said dolly , dropping the syrup from the spoon .
when it sets as it drops , it s ready .
cook it a little longer , agafea mihalovna .
the flies !
said agafea mihalovna angrily .
it ll be just the same , she added .
ah !
how sweet it is !
don t frighten it !
kitty said suddenly , looking at a sparrow that had settled on the step and was pecking at the center of a raspberry .
yes , but you keep a little further from the stove , said her mother .
propos de , said kitty , speaking in french , as they had been doing all the while , so that agafea mihalovna should not understand them , you know , mamma , i somehow expect things to be settled today .
you know what i mean .
how splendid it would be !
but what a famous matchmaker she is !
said dolly .
how carefully and cleverly she throws them together !
no ; tell me , mamma , what do you think ?
why , what is one to think ?
he ( meant sergey ivanovitch ) might at any time have been a match for anyone in russia ; now , of course , he s not quite a young man , still i know ever so many girls would be glad to marry him even now she s a very nice girl , but he might oh , no , mamma , do understand why , for him and for her too , nothing better could be imagined .
in the first place , she s charming !
said kitty , crooking one of her fingers .
he thinks her very attractive , that s certain , assented dolly .
then he occupies such a position in society that he has no need to look for either fortune or position in his wife .
all he needs is a good , sweet restful one .
well , with her he would certainly be restful , dolly assented .
thirdly , that she should love him .
and so it is that is , it would be so splendid !
i look forward to seeing them coming out of the everything settled .
i shall see at once by their eyes .
i should be so delighted !
what do you think , dolly ?
but don t excite yourself .
it s not at all the thing for you to be excited , said her mother .
oh , i m not excited , mamma .
i fancy he will make her an offer today .
ah , that s so strange , how and when a man makes an offer !
there is a sort of barrier , and all at once it s broken down , said dolly , smiling pensively and recalling her past with stepan arkadyevitch .
mamma , how did papa make you an offer ?
kitty asked suddenly .
there was nothing out of the way , it was very simple , answered the princess , but her face beamed all over at the recollection .
oh , but how was it ?
you loved him , anyway , before you were allowed to speak ?
kitty felt a peculiar pleasure in being able now to talk to her mother on equal terms about those questions of such paramount interest in a woman s life .
of course i did ; he had come to stay with us in the country .
but how was it settled between you , mamma ?
you imagine , i dare say , that you invented something quite new ?
it s always just the same it was settled by the eyes , by smiles how nicely you said that , mamma !
it s just by the eyes , by smiles that it s done , dolly assented .
but what words did he say ?
what did kostya say to you ?
he wrote it in chalk .
it was wonderful how long ago it seems !
she said .
and the three women all fell to musing on the same thing .
kitty was the first to break the silence .
she remembered all that last winter before her marriage , and her passion for vronsky .
there s one thing that old love affair of varenka s , she said , a natural chain of ideas bringing her to this point .
i should have liked to say something to sergey ivanovitch , to prepare him .
they re men , i mean , she added , awfully jealous over our past .
not all , said dolly .
you judge by your own husband .
it makes him miserable even now to remember vronsky .
eh ?
that s true , isn t it ?
yes , kitty answered , a pensive smile in her eyes .
but i really don t know , the mother put in in defense of her motherly care of her daughter , what there was in your past that could worry him ?
that vronsky paid you happens to every girl .
oh , yes , but we didn t mean that , kitty said , flushing a little .
no , let me speak , her mother went on , why , you yourself would not let me have a talk to vronsky .
don t you remember ?
oh , mamma !
said kitty , with an expression of suffering .
there s no keeping you young people in check nowadays
your friendship could not have gone beyond what was suitable .
i should myself have called upon him to explain himself .
but , my darling , it s not right for you to be agitated .
please remember that , and calm yourself .
i m perfectly calm , maman .
how happy it was for kitty that anna came then , said dolly , and how unhappy for her .
it turned out quite the opposite , she said , struck by her own ideas .
then anna was so happy , and kitty thought herself unhappy .
now it is just the opposite .
i often think of her .
a nice person to think about !
horrid , repulsive heart , said her mother , who could not forget that kitty had married not vronsky , but levin .
what do you want to talk of it for ?
kitty said with annoyance .
i never think about it , and i don t want to think of it and i don t want to think of it , she said , catching the sound of her husband s step on the steps of the terrace .
what s that you don t want to think about ?
inquired levin , coming onto the terrace .
but no one answered him , and he did not repeat the question .
i m sorry i ve broken in on your feminine parliament , he said , looking round on every one discontentedly , and perceiving that they had been talking of something which they would not talk about before him .
for a second he felt that he was sharing the feeling of agafea mihalovna , vexation at their making jam without water , and altogether at the outside shtcherbatsky element .
he smiled , however , and went up to kitty .
well , how are you ?
he asked her , looking at her with the expression with which everyone looked at her now .
oh , very well , said kitty , smiling , and how have things gone with you ?
the wagons held three times as much as the old carts did .
well , are we going for the children ?
i ve ordered the horses to be put in .
what !
you want to take kitty in the wagonette ?
her mother said reproachfully .
yes , at a walking pace , princess .
levin never called the princess maman as men often do call their , and the princess disliked his not doing so .
but though he liked and respected the princess , levin could not call her so without a sense of profaning his feeling for his dead mother .
come with us , maman , said kitty .
i don t like to see such imprudence .
well , i ll walk then , i m so well .
kitty got up and went to her husband and took his hand .
you may be well , but everything in moderation , said the princess .
well , agafea mihalovna , is the jam done ?
said levin , smiling to agafea mihalovna , and trying to cheer her up .
is it all right in the new way ?
i suppose it s all right .
for our notions it s boiled too long .
it ll be all the better , agafea mihalovna , it won t mildew , even though our ice has begun to thaw already , so that we ve no cool cellar to store it , said kitty , at once divining her husband s motive , and addressing the old housekeeper with the same feeling ; but your pickle s so good , that mamma says she never tasted any like it , she added , smiling , and putting her kerchief straight .
agafea mihalovna looked angrily at kitty .
you needn t try to console me , mistress .
i need only to look at you with him , and i feel happy , she said , and something in the rough familiarity of that touched kitty .
come along with us to look for mushrooms , you will show us the best places .
agafea mihalovna smiled and shook her head , as though to say i should like to be angry with you too , but i can t .
do it , please , by my receipt , said the princess ; put some paper over the jam , and moisten it with a little rum , and without even ice , it will never go mildewy .
kitty was particularly glad of a chance of being alone with her husband , for she had noticed the shade of mortification that had passed over his so quick to reflect every the moment when he had come onto the terrace and asked what they were talking of , and had got no answer .
when they had set off on foot ahead of the others , and had come out of sight of the house onto the beaten dusty road , marked with rusty wheels and sprinkled with grains of corn , she clung faster to his arm and pressed it closer to her .
he had quite forgotten the momentary unpleasant impression , and alone with her he felt , now that the thought of her approaching motherhood was never for a moment absent from his mind , a new and delicious bliss , quite pure from all alloy of sense , in the being near to the woman he loved .
there was no need of speech , yet he longed to hear the sound of her voice , which like her eyes had changed since she had been with child .
in her voice , as in her eyes , there was that softness and gravity which is found in people continually concentrated on some cherished pursuit .
so you re not tired ?
lean more on me , said he .
no , i m so glad of a chance of being alone with you , and i must own , though i m happy with them , i do regret our winter evenings alone .
that was good , but this is even better .
both are better , he said , squeezing her hand .
do you know what we were talking about when you came in ?
about jam ?
oh , yes , about jam too ; but afterwards , about how men make offers .
ah !
said levin , listening more to the sound of her voice than to the words she was saying , and all the while paying attention to the road , which passed now through the forest , and avoiding places where she might make a false step .
and about sergey ivanovitch and varenka .
you ve noticed ?
i m very anxious for it , she went on .
what do you think about it ?
and she peeped into his face .
i don t know what to think , levin answered , smiling .
sergey seems very strange to me in that way .
i told you , you know yes , that he was in love with that girl who died that was when i was a child ; i know about it from hearsay and tradition .
i remember him then .
he was wonderfully sweet .
but i ve watched him since with women ; he is friendly , some of them he likes , but one feels that to him they re simply people , not women .
yes , but now with varenka
i fancy there s something perhaps there is
but one has to know him he s a peculiar , wonderful person .
he lives a spiritual life only .
he s too pure , too exalted a nature .
why ?
would this lower him , then ?
no , but he s so used to a spiritual life that he can t reconcile himself with actual fact , and varenka is after all fact .
levin had grown used by now to uttering his thought boldly , without taking the trouble of clothing it in exact language .
he knew that his wife , in such moments of loving tenderness as now , would understand what he meant to say from a hint , and she did understand him .
yes , but there s not so much of that actual fact about her as about me .
i can see that he would never have cared for me .
she is altogether spiritual .
oh , no , he is so fond of you , and i am always so glad when my people like you yes , he s very nice to me ; but it s not as it was with poor nikolay you really cared for each other , levin finished .
why not speak of him ?
he added .
i sometimes blame myself for not ; it ends in one s forgetting .
ah , how terrible and dear he was !
yes , what were we talking about ?
levin said , after a pause .
you think he can t fall in love , said kitty , translating into her own language .
it s not so much that he can t fall in love , levin said , smiling , but he has not the weakness necessary i ve always envied him , and even now , when i m so happy , i still envy him .
you envy him for not being able to fall in love ?
i envy him for being better than i , said levin .
he does not live for himself .
his whole life is subordinated to his duty .
and that s why he can be calm and contented .
and you ?
kitty asked , with an ironical and loving smile .
she could never have explained the chain of thought that made her smile ; but the last link in it was that her husband , in exalting his brother and abasing himself , was not quite sincere .
kitty knew that this insincerity came from his love for his brother , from his sense of shame at being too happy , and above all from his unflagging craving to be loved it in him , and so she smiled .
and you ?
what are you dissatisfied with ?
she asked , with the same smile .
her disbelief in his delighted him , and unconsciously he tried to draw her into giving utterance to the grounds of her disbelief .
i am happy , but dissatisfied with myself he said .
why , how can you be dissatisfied with yourself if you are happy ?
well , how shall i say ?
in my heart i really care for nothing whatever but that you should not ?
oh , but really you mustn t skip about like that !
he cried , breaking off to scold her for too agile a movement in stepping over a branch that lay in the path .
but when i think about myself , and compare myself with others , especially with my brother , i feel i m a poor creature .
but in what way ?
kitty pursued with the same smile .
don t you too work for others ?
what about your settlement , and your work on the estate , and your book ?
oh , but i feel , and particularly just s your fault , he said , pressing her that all that doesn t count .
i do it in a way halfheartedly .
if i could care for all that as i care for you !
instead of that , i do it in these days like a task that is set me .
well , what would you say about papa ?
asked kitty .
is he a poor creature then , as he does nothing for the public good ?
he ? !
but then one must have the simplicity , the straightforwardness , the goodness of your father and i haven t got that .
i do nothing , and i fret about it .
it s all your doing .
before there was too , he added with a glance towards her waist that she i put all my energies into work ; now i can t , and i m ashamed ; i do it just as though it were a task set me , i m pretending well , but would you like to change this minute with sergey ivanovitch ?
said kitty .
would you like to do this work for the general good , and to love the task set you , as he does , and nothing else ?
of course not , said levin .
but i m so happy that i don t understand anything .
so you think he ll make her an offer today ?
he added after a brief silence .
i think so , and i don t think so .
only , i m awfully anxious for it .
here , wait a minute .
she stooped down and picked a wild camomile at the edge of the path .
come , count he does propose , he doesn t , she said , giving him the flower .
he does , he doesn t , said levin , tearing off the white petals .
no , no !
kitty , snatching at his hand , stopped him .
she had been watching his fingers with interest .
you picked off two .
oh , but see , this little one shan t count to make up , said levin , tearing off a little petal .
here s the wagonette overtaking us .
aren t you tired , kitty ?
called the princess .
not in the least .
if you are you can get in , as the horses are quiet and walking .
but it was not worth while to get in , they were quite near the place , and all walked on together .
varenka , with her white kerchief on her black hair , surrounded by the children , gaily and looking after them , and at the same time visibly excited at the possibility of receiving a declaration from the man she cared for , was very attractive .
sergey ivanovitch walked beside her , and never left off admiring her .
looking at her , he recalled all the delightful things he had heard from her lips , all the good he knew about her , and became more and more conscious that the feeling he had for her was something special that he had felt long , long ago , and only once , in his early youth .
the feeling of happiness in being near her continually grew , and at last reached such a point that , as he put a huge , agaric fungus in her basket , he looked straight into her face , and noticing the flush of glad and alarmed excitement that overspread her face , he was confused himself , and smiled to her in silence a smile that said too much .
if so , he said to himself , i ought to think it over and make up my mind , and not give way like a boy to the impulse of a moment .
i m going to pick by myself apart from all the rest , or else my efforts will make no show , he said , and he left the edge of the forest where they were walking on low silky grass between old birch trees standing far apart , and went more into the heart of the wood , where between the white birch trunks there were gray trunks of aspen and dark bushes of hazel .
walking some forty paces away , sergey ivanovitch , knowing he was out of sight , stood still behind a bushy in full flower with its rosy red catkins .
it was perfectly still all round him .
only overhead in the birches under which he stood , the flies , like a swarm of bees , buzzed unceasingly , and from time to time the children s voices were floated across to him .
all at once he heard , not far from the edge of the wood , the sound of varenka s contralto voice , calling grisha , and a smile of delight passed over sergey ivanovitch s face .
conscious of this smile , he shook his head disapprovingly at his own condition , and taking out a cigar , he began lighting it .
for a long while he could not get a match to light against the trunk of a birch tree .
the soft scales of the white bark rubbed off the phosphorus , and the light went out .
at last one of the matches burned , and the fragrant cigar smoke , hovering uncertainly in flat , wide coils , stretched away forwards and upwards over a bush under the overhanging branches of a birch tree .
watching the streak of smoke , sergey ivanovitch walked gently on , deliberating on his position .
why not ?
he thought .
if it were only a passing fancy or a passion , if it were only this mutual attraction ( i can call it a attraction ) , but if i felt that it was in contradiction with the whole bent of my i felt that in giving way to this attraction i should be false to my vocation and my duty but it s not so .
the only thing i can say against it is that , when i lost marie , i said to myself that i would remain faithful to her memory .
that s the only thing i can say against my feeling that s a great thing , sergey ivanovitch said to himself , feeling at the same time that this consideration had not the slightest importance for him personally , but would only perhaps detract from his romantic character in the eyes of others .
but apart from that , however much i searched , i should never find anything to say against my feeling .
if i were choosing by considerations of suitability alone , i could not have found anything better .
however many women and girls he thought of whom he knew , he could not think of a girl who united to such a degree all , positively all , the qualities he would wish to see in his wife .
she had all the charm and freshness of youth , but she was not a child ; and if she loved him , she loved him consciously as a woman ought to love ; that was one thing .
another point she was not only far from being worldly , but had an unmistakable distaste for worldly society , and at the same time she knew the world , and had all the ways of a woman of the best society , which were absolutely essential to sergey ivanovitch s conception of the woman who was to share his life .
thirdly she was religious , and not like a child , unconsciously religious and good , as kitty , for example , was , but her life was founded on religious principles .
even in trifling matters , sergey ivanovitch found in her all that he wanted in his wife she was poor and alone in the world , so she would not bring with her a mass of relations and their influence into her husband s house , as he saw now in kitty s case .
she would owe everything to her husband , which was what he had always desired too for his future family life .
and this girl , who united all these qualities , loved him .
he was a modest man , but he could not help seeing it .
and he loved her .
there was one consideration against age .
but he came of a family , he had not a single gray hair , no one would have taken him for forty , and he remembered varenka s saying that it was only in russia that men of fifty thought themselves old , and that in france a man of fifty considers himself la force de l , while a man of forty is jeune .
but what did the mere reckoning of years matter when he felt as young in heart as he had been twenty years ago ?
was it not youth to feel as he felt now , when coming from the other side to the edge of the wood he saw in the glowing light of the slanting sunbeams the gracious figure of varenka in her yellow gown with her basket , walking lightly by the trunk of an old birch tree , and when this impression of the sight of varenka blended so harmoniously with the beauty of the view , of the yellow oatfield lying bathed in the slanting sunshine , and beyond it the distant ancient forest flecked with yellow and melting into the blue of the distance ?
his heart throbbed joyously .
a softened feeling came over him .
he felt that he had made up his mind .
varenka , who had just crouched down to pick a mushroom , rose with a supple movement and looked round .
flinging away the cigar , sergey ivanovitch advanced with resolute steps towards her .
varvara andreevna , when i was very young , i set before myself the ideal of the woman i loved and should be happy to call my wife .
i have lived through a long life , and now for the first time i have met what i you .
i love you , and offer you my hand .
sergey ivanovitch was saying this to himself while he was ten paces from varvara .
kneeling down , with her hands over the mushrooms to guard them from grisha , she was calling little masha .
come here , little ones !
there are so many !
she was saying in her sweet , deep voice .
seeing sergey ivanovitch approaching , she did not get up and did not change her position , but everything told him that she felt his presence and was glad of it .
well , did you find some ?
she asked from under the white kerchief , turning her handsome , gently smiling face to him .
not one , said sergey ivanovitch .
did you ?
she did not answer , busy with the children who thronged about her .
that one too , near the twig , she pointed out to little masha a little fungus , split in half across its rosy cap by the dry grass from under which it thrust itself .
varenka got up while masha picked the fungus , breaking it into two white halves .
this brings back my childhood , she added , moving apart from the children beside sergey ivanovitch .
they walked on for some steps in silence .
varenka saw that he wanted to speak ; she guessed of what , and felt faint with joy and panic .
they had walked so far away that no one could hear them now , but still he did not begin to speak .
it would have been better for varenka to be silent .
after a silence it would have been easier for them to say what they wanted to say than after talking about mushrooms .
but against her own will , as it were accidentally , varenka said so you found nothing ?
in the middle of the wood there are always fewer , though .
sergey ivanovitch sighed and made no answer .
he was annoyed that she had spoken about the mushrooms .
he wanted to bring her back to the first words she had uttered about her childhood ; but after a pause of some length , as though against his own will , he made an observation in response to her last words .
i have heard that the white edible funguses are found principally at the edge of the wood , though i can t tell them apart .
some minutes more passed , they moved still further away from the children , and were quite alone .
varenka s heart throbbed so that she heard it beating , and felt that she was turning red and pale and red again .
to be the wife of a man like koznishev , after her position with madame stahl , was to her imagination the height of happiness .
besides , she was almost certain that she was in love with him .
and this moment it would have to be decided .
