when i drew nigh the nameless city i knew it was accursed .
i was traveling in a parched and terrible valley under the moon , and afar i saw it protruding uncannily above the sands as parts of a corpse may protrude from an grave .
fear spoke from the stones of this hoary survivor of the deluge , this of the eldest pyramid ; and a viewless aura repelled me and bade me retreat from antique and sinister secrets that no man should see , and no man else had dared to see
remote in the desert of araby lies the nameless city , crumbling and inarticulate , its low walls nearly hidden by the sands of uncounted ages .
it must have been thus before the first stones of memphis were laid , and while the bricks of babylon were yet unbaked .
there is no legend so old as to give it a name , or to recall that it was ever alive ; but it is told of in whispers around campfires and muttered about by grandams in the tents of sheiks so that all the tribes shun it without wholly knowing why .
it was of this place that abdul alhazred the mad poet dreamed of the night before he sang his unexplained couplet that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons death may die .
i should have known that the arabs had good reason for shunning the nameless city , the city told of in strange tales but seen by no living man , yet i defied them and went into the untrodden waste with my camel .
i alone have seen it , and that is why no other face bears such hideous lines of fear as mine ; why no other man shivers so horribly when the night wind rattles the windows .
when i came upon it in the ghastly stillness of unending sleep it looked at me , chilly from the rays of a cold moon amidst the desert heat .
and as i returned its look i forgot my triumph at finding it , and stopped still with my camel to wait for the dawn .
for hours i waited , till the east grew grey and the stars faded , and the grey turned to roseate light edged with gold .
i heard a moaning and saw a storm of sand stirring among the antique stones though the sky was clear and the vast reaches of desert still .
then suddenly above the desert far rim came the blazing edge of the sun , seen through the tiny sandstorm which was passing away , and in my fevered state i fancied that from some remote depth there came a crash of musical metal to hail the fiery disc as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile .
my ears rang and my imagination seethed as i led my camel slowly across the sand to that unvocal place ; that place which i alone of living men had seen .
in and out amongst the shapeless foundations of houses and places i wandered , finding never a carving or inscription to tell of these men , if men they were , who built this city and dwelt therein so long ago .
the antiquity of the spot was unwholesome , and i longed to encounter some sign or device to prove that the city was indeed fashioned by mankind .
there were certain proportions and dimensions in the ruins which i did not like .
i had with me many tools , and dug much within the walls of the obliterated edifices ; but progress was slow , and nothing significant was revealed .
when night and the moon returned i felt a chill wind which brought new fear , so that i did not dare to remain in the city .
and as i went outside the antique walls to sleep , a small sighing sandstorm gathered behind me , blowing over the grey stones though the moon was bright and most of the desert still .
i awakened just at dawn from a pageant of horrible dreams , my ears ringing as from some metallic peal .
i saw the sun peering redly through the last gusts of a little sandstorm that hovered over the nameless city , and marked the quietness of the rest of the landscape .
once more i ventured within those brooding ruins that swelled beneath the sand like an ogre under a coverlet , and again dug vainly for relics of the forgotten race .
at noon i rested , and in the afternoon i spent much time tracing the walls and bygone streets , and the outlines of the nearly vanished buildings .
i saw that the city had been mighty indeed , and wondered at the sources of its greatness .
to myself i pictured all the spendours of an age so distant that chaldaea could not recall it , and thought of sarnath the doomed , that stood in the land of mnar when mankind was young , and of ib , that was carven of grey stone before mankind existed .
all at once i came upon a place where the bed rock rose stark through the sand and formed a low cliff ; and here i saw with joy what seemed to promise further traces of the antediluvian people .
hewn rudely on the face of the cliff were the unmistakable facades of several small , squat rock houses or temples ; whose interiors might preserve many secrets of ages too remote for calculation , though sandstorms had long effaced any carvings which may have been outside .
very low and were all the dark apertures near me , but i cleared on with my spade and crawled through it , carrying a torch to reveal whatever mysteries it might hold .
when i was inside i saw that the cavern was indeed a temple , and beheld plain signs of the race that had lived and worshipped before the desert was a desert .
primitive altars , pillars , and niches , all curiously low , were not absent ; and though i saw no sculptures or frescoes , there were many singular stones clearly shaped into symbols by artificial means .
the lowness of the chiselled chamber was very strange , for i could hardly kneel upright ; but the area was so great that my torch showed only part of it at a time .
i shuddered oddly in some of the far corners ; for certain altars and stones suggested forgotten rites of terrible , revolting and inexplicable nature and made me wonder what manner of men could have made and frequented such a temple .
when i had seen all that the place contained , i crawled out again , avid to find what the temples might yield .
night had now approached , yet the tangible things i had seen made curiosity stronger than fear , so that i did not flee from the long mooncast shadows that had daunted me when first i saw the nameless city .
in the twilight i cleared another aperture and with a new torch crawled into it , finding more vague stones and symbols , though nothing more definite than the other temple had contained the room was just as low , but much less broad , ending in a very narrow passage crowded with obscure and cryptical shrines .
about these shrines i was prying when the noise of a wind and my camel outside broke through the stillness and drew me forth to see what could have frightened the beast .
the moon was gleaming vividly over the primitive ruins , lighting a dense cloud of sand that seemed blown by a strong but decreasing wind from some point along the cliff ahead of me .
i knew it was this chilly , sandy wind which had disturbed the camel and was about to lead him to a place of better shelter when i chanced to glance up and saw that there was no wind atop the cliff .
this astonished me and made me fearful again , but i immediately recalled the sudden local winds that i had seen and heard before at sunrise and sunset , and judged it was a normal thing .
i decided it came from some rock fissure leading to a cave , and watched the troubled sand to trace it to its source ; soon perceiving that it came from the black orifice of a temple a long distance south of me , almost out of sight .
against the choking i plodded toward this temple , which as i neared it loomed larger than the rest , and shewed a doorway far less clogged with caked sand .
i would have entered had not the terrific force of the icy wind almost quenched my torch .
it poured madly out of the dark door , sighing uncannily as it ruffled the sand and spread among the weird ruins .
soon it grew fainter and the sand grew more and more still , till finally all was at rest again ; but a presence seemed stalking among the spectral stones of the city , and when i glanced at the moon it seemed to quiver as though mirrored in unquiet waters .
i was more afraid than i could explain , but not enough to dull my thirst for wonder ; so as soon as the wind was quite gone i crossed into the dark chamber from which it had come .
this temple , as i had fancied from the outside , was larger than either of those i had visited before ; and was presumably a natural cavern since it bore winds from some region beyond .
here i could stand quite upright , but saw that the stones and altars were as low as those in the other temples .
on the walls and roof i beheld for the first time some traces of the pictorial art of the ancient race , curious curling streaks of paint that had almost faded or crumbled away ; and on two of the altars i saw with rising excitement a maze of curvilinear carvings .
as i held my torch aloft it seemed to me that the shape of the roof was too regular to be natural , and i wondered what the prehistoric cutters of stone had first worked upon .
their engineering skill must have been vast .
then a brighter flare of the fantastic flame showed that form which i had been seeking , the opening to those remoter abysses whence the sudden wind had blown ; and i grew faint when i saw that it was a small and plainly artificial door chiselled in the solid rock .
i thrust my torch within , beholding a black tunnel with the roof arching low over a rough flight of very small , numerous and steeply descending steps .
i shall always see those steps in my dreams , for i came to learn what they meant .
at the time i hardly knew whether to call them steps or mere footholds in a precipitous descent .
my mind was whirling with mad thoughts , and the words and warning of arab prophets seemed to float across the desert from the land that men know to the nameless city that men dare not know .
yet i hesitated only for a moment before advancing through the portal and commencing to climb cautiously down the steep passage , feet first , as though on a ladder .
it is only in the terrible phantasms of drugs or delirium that any other man can have such a descent as mine .
the narrow passage led infinitely down like some hideous haunted well , and the torch i held above my head could not light the unknown depths toward which i was crawling .
i lost track of the hours and forgot to consult my watch , though i was frightened when i thought of the distance i must have be traversing .
there were changes of direction and of steepness ; and once i came to a long , low , level passage where i had to wriggle my feet first along the rocky floor , holding torch at arm length beyond my head .
the place was not high enough for kneeling .
after that were more of the steep steps , and i was still scrambling down interminably when my failing torch died out .
i do not think i noticed it at the time , for when i did notice it i was still holding it above me as if it were ablaze .
i was quite unbalanced with that instinct for the strange and the unknown which had made me a wanderer upon earth and a haunter of far , ancient , and forbidden places .
in the darkness there flashed before my mind fragments of my cherished treasury of daemonic lore ; sentences from alhazred the mad arab , paragraphs from the apocryphal nightmares of damascius , and infamous lines from the delirious image du monde of gauthier de metz .
i repeated queer extracts , and muttered of afrasiab and the daemons that floated with him down the oxus ; later chanting over and over again a phrase from one of lord dunsany tales the unreveberate blackness of the abyss .
once when the descent grew amazingly steep i recited something in from thomas moore until i feared to recite more a reservoir of darkness , black as witches ' cauldrons are , when with in th ' eclipse leaning to look if foot might pass down thro ' that chasm , i saw , beneath , as far as vision could explore , the jetty sides as smooth as glass , looking as if just varnish with that dark pitch the seat of death throws out upon its slimy shore .
time had quite ceased to exist when my feet again felt a level floor , and i found myself in a place slightly higher than the rooms in the two smaller temples now so incalculably far above my head .
i could not quite stand , but could kneel upright , and in the dark i shuffled and crept hither and thither at random .
i soon knew that i was in a narrow passage whose walls were lined with cases of wood having glass fronts .
as in that palaeozoic and abysmal place i felt of such things as polished wood and glass i shuddered at the possible implications .
the cases were apparently ranged along each side of the passage at regular intervals , and were oblong and horizontal , hideously like coffins in shape and size .
when i tried to move two or three for further examination , i found that they were firmly fastened .
i saw that the passage was a long one , so floundered ahead rapidly in a creeping run that would have seemed horrible had any eye watched me in the blackness ; crossing from side to side occasionally to feel of my surroundings and be sure the walls and rows of cases still stretched on .
man is so used to thinking visually that i almost forgot the darkness and pictured the endless corridor of wood and glass in its monotony as though i saw it .
and then in a moment of indescribable emotion i did see it .
just when my fancy merged into real sight i can not tell ; but there came a gradual glow ahead , and all at once i knew that i saw the dim outlines of a corridor and the cases , revealed by some unknown subterranean phosphorescence .
for a little while all was exactly as i had imagined it , since the glow was very faint ; but as i mechanically kept stumbling ahead into the stronger light i realised that my fancy had been but feeble .
this hall was no relic of crudity like the temples in the city above , but a monument of the most magnificent and exotic art .
rich , vivid , and daringly fantastic designs and pictures formed a continuous scheme of mural paintings whose lines and colours were beyond description .
the cases were of a strange golden wood , with fronts of exquisite glass , and containing the mummified forms of creatures outreaching in grotesqueness the most chaotic dreams of man .
to convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible .
they were of the reptile kind , with body lines suggestion sometimes the crocodile , sometimes the seal , but more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the palaeontologist ever heard .
in size they approximated a small man , and their bore delicate and evident feet curiously like human hands and fingers .
but strangest of all were their heads , which presented a contour violating all known biological principles .
to nothing can such things be well compared in one flash i thought of comparisons as varied as the cat , the bullfrog , the mythic satyr , and the human being .
not jove himself had had so colossal and protuberant a forehead , yet the horns and the noselessness and the jaw placed things outside all established categories .
i debated for a time on the reality of the mummies , half suspecting they were artificial idols ; but soon decided they were indeed some palaeogean species which had lived when the nameless city was alive .
to crown their grotesqueness , most of them were gorgeously enrobed in the costliest of fabrics , and lavishly laden with ornaments of gold , jewels , and unknown shining metals .
the importance of these crawling creatures must have been vast , for they held first place among the wild designs on the frescoed walls and ceiling .
with matchless skill had the artist drawn them in a world of their own , wherein they had cities and gardens fashioned to suit their dimensions ; and i could not help but think that their pictured history was allegorical , perhaps showing the progress of the race that worshipped them .
these creatures , i said to myself , were to men of the nameless city what the was to rome , or some is to a tribe of indians .
holding this view , i could trace roughly a wonderful epic of the nameless city ; the tale of a mighty seacoast metropolis that ruled the world before africa rose out of the waves , and of its struggles as the sea shrank away , and the desert crept into the fertile valley that held it .
i saw its wars and triumphs , its troubles and defeats , and afterwards its terrible fight against the desert when thousands of its people here represented in allegory by the grotesque reptiles were driven to chisel their way down through the rocks in some marvellous manner to another world whereof their prophets had told them .
it was all vividly weird and realistic , and its connection with the awesome descent i had made was unmistakable .
i even recognized the passages .
as i crept along the corridor toward the brighter light i saw later stages of the painted epic the of the race that had dwelt in the nameless city and the valley around for ten million years ; the race whose souls shrank from quitting scenes their bodies had known so long where they had settled as nomads in the earth youth , hewing in the virgin rock those primal shrines at which they had never ceased to worship .
now that the light was better i studied the pictures more closely and , remembering that the strange reptiles must represent the unknown men , pondered upon the customs of the nameless city .
many things were peculiar and inexplicable .
the civilization , which included a written alphabet , had seemingly risen to a higher order than those immeasurably later civilizations of egypt and chaldaea , yet there were curious omissions .
i could , for example , find no pictures to represent deaths or funeral customs , save such as were related to wars , violence , and plagues ; and i wondered at the reticence shown concerning natural death .
it was as though an ideal of immortality had been fostered as a cheering illusion .
still nearer the end of the passage was painted scenes of the utmost picturesqueness and extravagance contrasted views of the nameless city in its desertion and growing ruin , and of the strange new realm of paradise to which the race had hewed its way through the stone .
in these views the city and the desert valley were shewn always by moonlight , golden nimbus hovering over the fallen walls , and the splendid perfection of former times , shown spectrally and elusively by the artist .
the paradisal scenes were almost too extravagant to be believed , portraying a hidden world of eternal day filled with glorious cities and ethereal hills and valleys .
at the very last i thought i saw signs of an artistic anticlimax .
the paintings were less skillful , and much more bizarre than even the wildest of the earlier scenes .
they seemed to record a slow decadence of the ancient stock , coupled with a growing ferocity toward the outside world from which it was driven by the desert .
the forms of the people always represented by the sacred reptiles appeared to be gradually wasting away , through their spirit as shewn hovering above the ruins by moonlight gained in proportion .
emaciated priests , displayed as reptiles in ornate robes , cursed the upper air and all who breathed it ; and one terrible final scene shewed a man , perhaps a pioneer of ancient irem , the city of pillars , torn to pieces by members of the elder race .
i remember how the arabs fear the nameless city , and was glad that beyond this place the grey walls and ceiling were bare .
as i viewed the pageant of mural history i had approached very closely to the end of the hall , and was aware of a gate through which came all of the illuminating phosphorescence .
creeping up to it , i cried aloud in transcendent amazement at what lay beyond ; for instead of other and brighter chambers there was only an illimitable void of uniform radiance , such one might fancy when gazing down from the peak of mount everest upon a sea of sunlit mist .
behind me was a passage so cramped that i could not stand upright in it ; before me was an infinity of subterranean effulgence .
reaching down from the passage into the abyss was the head of a steep flight of steps small numerous steps like those of black passages i had traversed but after a few feet the glowing vapours concealed everything .
swung back open against the wall of the passage was a massive door of brass , incredibly thick and decorated with fantastic , which could if closed shut the whole inner world of light away from the vaults and passages of rock .
i looked at the step , and for the nonce dared not try them .
i touched the open brass door , and could not move it .
then i sank prone to the stone floor , my mind aflame with prodigious reflections which not even a exhaustion could banish .
as i lay still with closed eyes , free to ponder , many things i had lightly noted in the frescoes came back to me with new and terrible significance scenes representing the nameless city in its heyday the vegetations of the valley around it , and the distant lands with which its merchants traded .
the allegory of the crawling creatures puzzled me by its universal prominence , and i wondered that it would be so closely followed in a pictured history of such importance .
in the frescoes the nameless city had been shewn in proportions fitted to the reptiles .
i wondered what its real proportions and magnificence had been , and reflected a moment on certain oddities i had noticed in the ruins .
i thought curiously of the lowness of the primal temples and of the underground corridor , which were doubtless hewn thus out of deference to the reptile deities there honoured ; though it perforce reduced the worshippers to crawling .
perhaps the very rites here involved crawling in imitation of the creatures .
no religious theory , however , could easily explain why the level passages in that awesome descent should be as low as the temples or lower , since one could not even kneel in it .
as i thought of the crawling creatures , whose hideous mummified forms were so close to me , i felt a new throb of fear .
mental associations are curious , and i shrank from the idea that except for the poor primitive man torn to pieces in the last painting , mine was the only human form amidst the many relics and symbols of the primordial life .
but as always in my strange and roving existence , wonder soon drove out fear ; for the luminous abyss and what it might contain presented a problem worthy of the greatest explorer that a weird world of mystery lay far down that flight of peculiarly small steps i could not doubt , and i hoped to find there those human memorials which the painted corridor had failed to give .
the frescoes had pictured unbelievable cities , and valleys in this lower realm , and my fancy dwelt on the rich and colossal ruins that awaited me .
my fears , indeed , concerned the past rather than the future .
not even the physical horror of my position in that cramped corridor of dead reptiles and antediluvian frescoes , miles below the world i knew and faced by another world of eery light and mist , could match the lethal dread i felt at the abysmal antiquity of the scene and its soul .
an ancientness so vast that measurement is feeble seemed to leer down from the primal stones and temples of the nameless city , while the very latest of the astounding maps in the frescoes shewed oceans and continents that man has forgotten , with only here and there some vaguely familiar outlines .
of what could have happened in the geological ages since the paintings ceased and the race resentfully succumbed to decay , no man might say .
life had once teemed in these caverns and in the luminous realm beyond ; now i was alone with vivid relics , and i trembled to think of the countless ages through which these relics had kept a silent deserted vigil .
suddenly there came another burst of that acute fear which had intermittently seized me ever since i first saw the terrible valley and the nameless city under a cold moon , and despite my exhaustion i found myself starting frantically to a sitting posture and gazing back along the black corridor toward the tunnels that rose to the outer world .
my sensations were like those which had made me shun the nameless city at night , and were as inexplicable as they were poignant .
in another moment , however , i received a still greater shock in the form of a definite sound the first which had broken the utter silence of these depths .
it was a deep , low moaning , as of a distant throng of condemned spirits , and came from the direction in which i was staring .
its volume rapidly grew , till it soon reverberated rightfully through the low passage , and at the same time i became conscious of an increasing draught of old air , likewise flowing from the tunnels and the city above .
the touch of this air seemed to restore my balance , for i instantly recalled the sudden gusts which had risen around the mouth of the abyss each sunset and sunrise , one of which had indeed revealed the hidden tunnels to me .
i looked at my watch and saw that sunrise was near , so bracing myself to resist the gale that was sweeping down to its cavern home as it had swept forth at evening .
my fear again waned low , since a natural phenomenon tends to dispel broodings over the unknown .
more and more madly poured the shrieking , moaning night wind into the gulf of the inner earth .
i dropped prone again and clutched vainly at the floor for fear of being swept bodily through the open gate into the phosphorescent abyss .
such fury i had not expected , and as i grew aware of an actual slipping of my form toward the abyss i was beset by a thousand new terrors of apprehension and imagination .
the malignancy of the blast awakened incredible fancies ; once more i compared myself shudderingly to the only human image in that frightful corridor , the man who was torn to pieces by the nameless race , for in the fiendish clawing of the swirling currents there seemed to abide a vindictive rage all the stronger because it was largely impotent .
i think i screamed frantically near the last i was almost mad of the howling .
i tried to crawl against the murderous invisible torrent , but i could not even hold my own as i was pushed slowly and inexorably toward the unknown world .
finally reason must have wholly snapped ; for i fell babbling over and over that unexplainable couplet of the mad arab alhazred , who dreamed of the nameless city that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die .
only the grim brooding desert gods know what really took place what indescribable struggles and scrambles in the dark i endured or what abaddon guided me back to life , where i must always remember and shiver in the night wind till oblivion or worse claims me .
monstrous , unnatural , colossal , was the thing too far beyond all the ideas of man to be believed except in the silent damnable small hours of the morning when one can not sleep .
i have said that the fury of the rushing blast was infernal cacodaemoniacal and that its voices were hideous with the viciousness of desolate eternities .
presently these voices , while still chaotic before me , seemed to my beating brain to take articulate form behind me ; and down there in the grave of unnumbered antiquities , leagues below the world of men , i heard the ghastly cursing and snarling of fiends .
turning , i saw outlined against the luminous aether of the abyss that could not be seen against the dusk of the corridor a nightmare horde of rushing devils ; hate distorted , grotesquely panoplied , half transparent devils of a race no man might mistake the crawling reptiles of the nameless city .
and as the wind died away i was plunged into the darkness of earth bowels ; for behind the last of the creatures the great brazen door clanged shut with a deafening peal of metallic music whose reverberations swelled out to the distant world to hail the rising sun as memnon hails it from the banks of the nile .
efficiut daemones , ut quae non sunt , sic tamen quasi sint , conspicienda hominibus exhibeant .
lacantius ( devils so work that things which are not appear to men as if they were real . )
i was far from home , and the spell of the eastern sea was upon me .
in the twilight i heard it pounding on the rocks , and i knew it lay just over the hill where the twisting willows writhed against the clearing sky and the first stars of evening .
and because my fathers had called me to the old town beyond , i pushed on through the shallow , snow along the road that soared lonely up to where aldebaran twinkled among the trees ; on toward the very ancient town i had never seen but often dreamed of .
it was the yuletide , that men call christmas though they know in their hearts it is older than bethlehem and babylon , older than memphis and mankind .
it was the yuletide , and i had come at last to the ancient sea town where my people had dwelt and kept festival in the elder time when festival was forbidden ; where also they had commanded their sons to keep festival once every century , that the memory of primal secrets might not be forgotten .
mine were an old people , and were old even when this land was settled three hundred years before .
and they were strange , because they had come as dark furtive folk from opiate southern gardens of orchids , and spoken another tongue before they learnt the tongue of the fishers .
and now they were scattered , and shared only the rituals of mysteries that none living could understand .
i was the only one who came back that night to the old fishing town as legend bade , for only the poor and the lonely remember .
then beyond the hill crest i saw kingsport outspread frostily in the gloaming ; snowy kingsport with its ancient vanes and steeples , ridgepoles and , wharves and small bridges , and graveyards ; endless labyrinths of steep , narrow , crooked streets , and dizzy central peak that time durst not touch ; ceaseless mazes of colonial houses piled and scattered at all angles and levels like a child disordered blocks ; antiquity hovering on grey wings over gables and gambrel roofs ; fanlights and windows one by one gleaming out in the cold dusk to join orion and the archaic stars .
and against the rotting wharves the sea pounded ; the secretive , immemorial sea out of which the people had come in the elder time .
beside the road at its crest a still higher summit rose , bleak and windswept , and i saw that it was a where black gravestones stuck ghoulishly through the snow like the decayed fingernails of a gigantic corpse .
the printless road was very lonely , and sometimes i thought i heard a distant horrible creaking as of a gibbet in the wind .
they had hanged four kinsmen of mine for witchcraft in , but i did not know just where .
as the road wound down the seaward slope i listened for the merry sounds of a village at evening , but did not hear them .
then i thought of the season , and felt that these old puritan folk might well have christmas customs strange to me , and full of silent hearthside prayer .
so after that i did not listen for merriment or look for wayfarers , kept on down past the hushed lighted farmhouses and shadowy stone walls to where the signs of ancient shops and sea taverns creaked in the salt breeze , and the grotesque knockers of pillared doorways glistened along deserted unpaved lanes in the light of little , curtained windows .
i had seen maps of the town , and knew where to find the home of my people .
it was told that i should be known and welcomed , for village legend lives long ; so i hastened through back street to circle court , and across the fresh snow on the one full flagstone pavement in the town , to where green lane leads off behind the market house .
the old maps still held good , and i had no trouble ; though at arkham they must have lied when they said the trolleys ran to this place , since i saw not a wire overhead .
snow would have hid the rails in any case .
i was glad i had chosen to walk , for the white village had seemed very beautiful from the hill ; and now i was eager to knock at the door of my people , the seventh house on the left in green lane , with an ancient peaked roof and jutting second storey , all built before .
there were lights inside the house when i came upon it , and i saw from the diamond that it must have been kept very close to its antique state .
the upper part overhung the narrow street and nearly met the part of the house opposite , so that i was almost in a tunnel , with the low stone doorstep wholly free from snow .
there was no sidewalk , but many houses had high doors reached by double flights of steps with iron railings .
it was an odd scene , and because i was strange to new england i had never known its like before .
though it pleased me , i would have relished it better if there had been footprints in the snow , and people in the streets , and a few windows without drawn curtains .
when i sounded the archaic iron knocker i was half afraid .
some fear had been gathering in me , perhaps because of the strangeness of my heritage , and the bleakness of the evening , and the queerness of the silence in that aged town of curious customs .
and when my knock was answered i was fully afraid , because i had not heard any footsteps before the door creaked open .
but i was not afraid long , for the gowned , slippered old man in the doorway had a bland face that reassured me ; and though he made signs that he was dumb , he wrote a quaint and ancient welcome with the stylus and wax tablet he carried .
he beckoned me into a low , room with massive exposed rafters and dark , stiff , sparse furniture of the seventeenth century .
the past was vivid there , for not an attribute was missing .
there was a cavernous fireplace and a at which a bent old woman in loose wrapper and deep sat back toward me , silently spinning despite the festive season .
an indefinite dampness seemed upon the place , and i marvelled that no fire should be blazing .
the settle faced the row of curtained windows at the left , and seemed to be occupied , though i was not sure .
i did not like everything about what i saw , and felt again the fear i had had .
this fear grew stronger from what had before lessened it , for the more i looked at the old man bland face the more its very blandness terrified me .
the eyes never moved , and the skin was too much like wax .
finally i was sure it was not a face at all , but a fiendishly cunning mask .
but the flabby hands , curiously gloved , wrote genially on the tablet and told me i must wait a while before i could be led to the place of the festival .
pointing to a chair , table , and pile of books , the old man now left the room ; and when i sat down to read i saw that the books were hoary and mouldy , and that they included old morryster wild marvels of science , the terrible saducismus triumphatus of joseph glanvil , published in , the shocking daemonolatreja of remigius , printed in at lyons , and worst of all , the unmentionable necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , in olaus wormius ' forbidden latin translation ; a book which i had never seen , but of which i had heard monstrous things whispered .
no one spoke to me , but i could hear the creaking of signs in the wind outside , and the whir of the wheel as the bonneted old woman continued her silent spinning , spinning .
i thought the room and the books and the people very morbid and disquieting , but because an old tradition of my fathers had summoned me to strange feastings , i resolved to expect queer things .
so i tried to read , and soon became tremblingly absorbed by something i found in that accursed necronomicon ; a thought and a legend too hideous for sanity or consciousness , but i disliked it when i fancied i heard the closing of one of the windows that the settle faced , as if it had been stealthily opened .
it had seemed to follow a whirring that was not of the old woman .
this was not much , though , for the old woman was spinning very hard , and the aged clock had been striking .
after that i lost the feeling that there were persons on the settle , and was reading intently and shudderingly when the old man came back booted and dressed in a loose antique costume , and sat down on that very bench , so that i could not see him .
it was certainly nervous waiting , and the blasphemous book in my hands made it doubly so .
when eleven struck , however , the old man stood up , glided to a massive carved chest in a corner , and got two hooded cloaks ; one of which he donned , and the other of which he draped round the old woman , who was ceasing her monotonous spinning .
then they both started for the outer door ; the woman lamely creeping , and the old man , after picking up the very book i had been reading , beckoning me as he drew his hood over that unmoving face or mask .
we went out into the moonless and tortuous network of that incredibly ancient town ; went out as the lights in the curtained windows disappeared one by one , and the dog star leered at the throng of cowled , cloaked figures that poured silently from every doorway and formed monstrous processions up this street and that , past the creaking sigus and antediluvian gables , the thatched roofs and windows ; threading precipitous lanes where decaying houses overlapped and crumbled together ; gliding across open courts and churchyards where the bobbing lanthorns made eldritch drunken constellations .
amid these hushed throngs i followed my voiceless guides ; jostled by elbows that seemed preternaturally soft , and pressed by chests and stomachs that seemed abnormally pulpy ; but seeing never a face and hearing never a word .
up , up , up , the eery columns slithered , and i saw that all the travellers were converging as they flowed near a sort of focus of crazy alleys at the top of a high hill in the centre of the town , where perched a great white church .
i had seen it from the road crest when i looked at kingsport in the new dusk , and it had made me shiver because aldebaran had seemed to balance itself a moment on the ghostly spire .
there was an open space around the church ; partly a churchyard with spectral shafts , and partly a square swept nearly bare of snow by the wind , and lined with unwholesomely archaic houses having peaked roofs and overhanging gables .
danced over the tombs , revealing gruesome vistas , though queerly failing to cast any shadows .
past the churchyard , where there were no houses , i could see over the hill summit and watch the glimmer of stars on the harbour , though the town was invisible in the dark .
only once in a while a lantern bobbed horribly through serpentine alleys on its way to overtake the throng that was now slipping speechlessly into the church .
i waited till the crowd had oozed into the black doorway , and till all the stragglers had followed .
the old man was pulling at my sleeve , but i was determined to be the last .
crossing the threshold into the swarming temple of unknown darkness , i turned once to look at the outside world as the churchyard phosphorescence cast a sickly glow on the hilltop pavement .
and as i did so i shuddered .
for though the wind had not left much snow , a few patches did remain on the path near the door ; and in that fleeting backward look it seemed to my troubled eyes that they bore no mark of passing feet , not even mine .
the church was scarce lighted by all the lanthorns that had entered it , for most of the throng had already vanished .
they had streamed up the aisle between the high pews to the of the vaults which yawned loathsomely open just before the pulpit , and were now squirming noiselessly in .
i followed dumbly down the steps and into the dark , suffocating crypt .
the tail of that sinuous line of seemed very horrible , and as i saw them wriggling into a venerable tomb they seemed more horrible still .
then i noticed that the tomb floor had an aperture down which the throng was sliding , and in a moment we were all descending an ominous staircase of stone ; a narrow spiral staircase damp and peculiarly odorous , that wound endlessly down into the bowels of the hill past monotonous walls of dripping stone blocks and crumbling mortar .
it was a silent , shocking descent , and i observed after a horrible interval that the walls and steps were changing in nature , as if chiselled out of the solid rock .
what mainly troubled me was that the myriad footfalls made no sound and set up no echoes .
after more aeons of descent i saw some side passages or burrows leading from unknown recesses of blackness to this shaft of nighted mystery .
soon they became excessively numerous , like impious catacombs of nameless menace ; and their pungent odour of decay grew quite unbearable .
i knew we must have passed down through the mountain and beneath the earth of kingsport itself , and i shivered that a town should be so aged and maggoty with subterraneous evil .
then i saw the lurid shimmering of pale light , and heard the insidious lapping of sunless waters .
again i shivered , for i did not like the things that the night had brought , and wished bitterly that no forefather had summoned me to this primal rite .
as the steps and the passage grew broader , i heard another sound , the thin , whining mockery of a feeble flute ; and suddenly there spread out before me the boundless vista of an inner world a vast fungous shore litten by a belching column of sick greenish flame and washed by a wide oily river that flowed from abysses frightful and unsuspected to join the blackest gulfs of immemorial ocean .
fainting and gasping , i looked at that unhallowed erebus of titan toadstools , leprous fire and slimy water , and saw the cloaked throngs forming a semicircle around the blazing pillar .
it was the , older than man and fated to survive him ; the primal rite of the solstice and of spring promise beyond the snows ; the rite of fire and evergreen , light and music .
and in the stygian grotto i saw them do the rite , and adore the sick pillar of flame , and throw into the water handfuls gouged out of the viscous vegetation which glittered green in the chlorotic glare .
i saw this , and i saw something amorphously squatted far away from the light , piping noisomely on a flute ; and as the thing piped i thought i heard noxious muffled flutterings in the foetid darkness where i could not see .
but what frightened me most was that flaming column ; spouting volcanically from depths profound and inconceivable , casting no shadows as healthy flame should , and coating the nitrous stone with a nasty , venomous verdigris .
for in all that seething combustion no warmth lay , but only the clamminess of death and corruption .
the man who had brought me now squirmed to a point directly beside the hideous flame , and made stiff ceremonial motions to the he faced .
at certain stages of the ritual they did grovelling obeisance , especially when he held above his head that abhorrent necronomicon he had taken with him ; and i shared all the obeisances because i had been summoned to this festival by the writings of my forefathers .
then the old man made a signal to the in the darkness , which player thereupon changed its feeble drone to a scarce louder drone in another key ; precipitating as it did so a horror unthinkable and unexpected .
at this horror i sank nearly to the lichened earth , transfixed with a dread not of this or any world , but only of the mad spaces between the stars .
out of the unimaginable blackness beyond the gangrenous glare of that cold flame , out of the tartarean leagues through which that oily river rolled uncanny , unheard , and unsuspected , there flopped rhythmically a horde of tame , trained , hybrid winged things that no sound eye could ever wholly grasp , or sound brain ever wholly remember .
they were not altogether crows , nor moles , nor buzzards , nor ants , nor vampire bats , nor decomposed human beings ; but something i can not and must not recall .
they flopped limply along , half with their webbed feet and half with their membranous wings ; and as they reached the throng of celebrants the cowled figures seized and mounted them , and rode off one by one along the reaches of that unlighted river , into pits and galleries of panic where poison springs feed frightful and undiscoverable cataracts .
the old spinning woman had gone with the throng , and the old man remained only because i had refused when he motioned me to seize an animal and ride like the rest .
i saw when i staggered to my feet that the amorphous had rolled out of sight , but that two of the beasts were patiently standing by .
as i hung back , the old man produced his stylus and tablet and wrote that he was the true deputy of my fathers who had founded the yule worship in this ancient place ; that it had been decreed i should come back , and that the most secret mysteries were yet to be performed .
he wrote this in a very ancient hand , and when i still hesitated he pulled from his loose robe a seal ring and a watch , both with my family arms , to prove that he was what he said .
but it was a hideous proof , because i knew from old papers that that watch had been buried with my in .
presently the old man drew back his hood and pointed to the family resemblance in his face , but i only shuddered , because i was sure that the face was merely a devilish waxen mask .
the flopping animals were now scratching restlessly at the lichens , and i saw that the old man was nearly as restless himself .
when one of the things began to waddle and edge away , he turned quickly to stop it ; so that the suddenness of his motion dislodged the waxen mask from what should have been his head .
and then , because that nightmare position barred me from the stone staircase down which we had come , i flung myself into the oily underground river that bubbled somewhere to the caves of the sea ; flung myself into that putrescent juice of earth inner horrors before the madness of my screams could bring down upon me all the charnel legions these might conceal .
at the hospital they told me i had been found in kingsport harbour at dawn , clinging to the drifting spar that accident sent to save me .
they told me i had taken the wrong fork of the hill road the night before , and fallen over the cliffs at orange point ; a thing they deduced from prints found in the snow .
there was nothing i could say , because everything was wrong .
everything was wrong , with the broad windows showing a sea of roofs in which only about one in five was ancient , and the sound of trolleys and motors in the streets below .
they insisted that this was kingsport , and i could not deny it .
when i went delirious at hearing that the hospital stood near the old churchyard on central hill , they sent me to mary hospital in arkham , where i could have better care .
i liked it there , for the doctors were , and even lent me their influence in obtaining the carefully sheltered copy of alhazred objectionable necronomicon from the library of miskatonic university .
they said something about a psychosis and agreed i had better get any harassing obsessions off my mind .
so i read that hideous chapter , and shuddered doubly because it was indeed not new to me .
i had seen it before , let footprints tell what they might ; and where it was i had seen it were best forgotten .
there was no one in waking hours who could remind me of it ; but my dreams are filled with terror , because of phrases i dare not quote .
i dare quote only one paragraph , put into such english as i can make from the awkward low latin .
the nethermost caverns , wrote the mad arab , are not for the fathoming of eyes that see ; for their marvels are strange and terrific .
cursed the ground where dead thoughts live new and oddly bodied , and evil the mind that is held by no head .
wisely did ibn schacabao say , that happy is the tomb where no wizard hath lain , and happy the town at night whose wizards are all ashes .
for it is of old rumour that the soul of the hastes not from his charnel clay , but fats and instructs the very worm that gnaws ; till out of corruption horrid life springs , and the dull scavengers of earth wax crafty to vex it and swell monstrous to plague it .
great holes secretly are digged where earth pores ought to suffice , and things have learnt to walk that ought to crawl .
west of arkham the hills rise wild , and there are valleys with deep woods that no axe has ever cut .
there are dark narrow glens where the trees slope fantastically , and where thin brooklets trickle without ever having caught the glint of sunlight .
on the gentle slopes there are farms , ancient and rocky , with squat , cottages brooding eternally over old new england secrets in the lee of great ledges ; but these are all vacant now , the wide chimneys crumbling and the shingled sides bulging perilously beneath low gambrel roofs .
the old folk have gone away , and foreigners do not like to live there .
have tried it , italians have tried it , and the poles have come and departed .
it is not because of anything that can be seen or heard or handled , but because of something that is imagined .
the place is not good for imagination , and does not bring restful dreams at night .
it must be this which keeps the foreigners away , for old ammi pierce has never told them of anything he recalls from the strange days .
ammi , whose head has been a little queer for years , is the only one who still remains , or who ever talks of the strange days ; and he dares to do this because his house is so near the open fields and the travelled roads around arkham .
there was once a road over the hills and through the valleys , that ran straight where the blasted heath is now ; but people ceased to use it and a new road was laid curving far toward the south .
traces of the old one can still be found amidst the weeds of a returning wilderness , and some of them will doubtless linger even when half the hollows are flooded for the new reservoir .
then the dark woods will be cut down and the blasted heath will slumber far below blue waters whose surface will mirror the sky and ripple in the sun .
and the secrets of the strange days will be one with the deep secrets ; one with the hidden lore of old ocean , and all the mystery of primal earth .
when i went into the hills and vales to survey for the new reservoir they told me the place was evil .
they told me this in arkham , and because that is a very old town full of witch legends i thought the evil must be something which grandams had whispered to children through centuries .
the name blasted heath seemed to me very odd and theatrical , and i wondered how it had come into the folklore of a puritan people .
then i saw that dark westward tangle of glens and slopes for myself , and ceased to wonder at anything beside its own elder mystery .
it was morning when i saw it , but shadow lurked always there .
the trees grew too thickly , and their trunks were too big for any healthy new england wood .
there was too much silence in the dim alleys between them , and the floor was too soft with the dank moss and mattings of infinite years of decay .
in the open spaces , mostly along the line of the old road , there were little hillside farms ; sometimes with all the buildings standing , sometimes with only one or two , and sometimes with only a lone chimney or cellar .
weeds and briers reigned , and furtive wild things rustled in the undergrowth .
upon everything was a haze of restlessness and oppression ; a touch of the unreal and the grotesque , as if some vital element of perspective or chiaroscuro were awry .
i did not wonder that the foreigners would not stay , for this was no region to sleep in .
it was too much like a landscape of salvator rosa ; too much like some forbidden woodcut in a tale of terror .
but even all this was not so bad as the blasted heath .
i knew it the moment i came upon it at the bottom of a spacious valley ; for no other name could fit such a thing , or any other thing fit such a name .
it was as if the poet had coined the phrase from having seen this one particular region .
it must , i thought as i viewed it , be the outcome of a fire ; but why had nothing new ever grown over these five acres of grey desolation that sprawled open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields ?
it lay largely to the north of the ancient road line , but encroached a little on the other side .
i felt an odd reluctance about approaching , and did so at last only because my business took me through and past it .
there was no vegetation of any kind on that broad expanse , but only a fine grey dust or ash which no wind seemed ever to blow about .
the trees near it were sickly and stunted , and many dead trunks stood or lay rotting at the rim .
as i walked hurriedly by i saw the tumbled bricks and stones of an old chimney and cellar on my right , and the yawning black maw of an abandoned well whose stagnant vapours played strange tricks with the hues of the sunlight .
even the long , dark woodland climb beyond seemed welcome in contrast , and i marvelled no more at the frightened whispers of arkham people .
there had been no house or ruin near ; even in the old days the place must have been lonely and remote .
and at twilight , dreading to repass that ominous spot , i walked circuitously back to the town by the curious road on the south .
i vaguely wished some clouds would gather , for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul .
in the evening i asked old people in arkham about the blasted heath , and what was meant by that phrase strange days which so many evasively muttered .
i could not , however , get any good answers except that all the mystery was much more recent than i had dreamed .
it was not a matter of old legendry at all , but something within the lifetime of those who spoke .
it had happened in the , and a family had disappeared or was killed .
speakers would not be exact ; and because they all told me to pay no attention to old ammi pierce crazy tales , i sought him out the next morning , having heard that he lived alone in the ancient tottering cottage where the trees first begin to get very thick .
it was a fearsomely ancient place , and had begun to exude the faint miasmal odour which clings about houses that have stood too long .
only with persistent knocking could i rouse the aged man , and when he shuffled timidly to the door i could tell he was not glad to see me .
he was not so feeble as i had expected ; but his eyes drooped in a curious way , and his unkempt clothing and white beard made him seem very worn and dismal .
not knowing just how he could best be launched on his tales , i feigned a matter of business ; told him of my surveying , and asked vague questions about the district .
he was far brighter and more educated than i had been led to think , and before i knew it had grasped quite as much of the subject as any man i had talked with in arkham .
he was not like other rustics i had known in the sections where reservoirs were to be .
from him there were no protests at the miles of old wood and farmland to be blotted out , though perhaps there would have been had not his home lain outside the bounds of the future lake .
relief was all that he showed ; relief at the doom of the dark ancient valleys through which he had roamed all his life .
they were better under water now better under water since the strange days .
and with this opening his husky voice sank low , while his body leaned forward and his right forefinger began to point shakily and impressively .
it was then that i heard the story , and as the rambling voice scraped and whispered on i shivered again and again spite the summer day .
often i had to recall the speaker from ramblings , piece out scientific points which he knew only by a fading parrot memory of professors ' talk , or bridge over gaps , where his sense of logic and continuity broke down .
when he was done i did not wonder that his mind had snapped a trifle , or that the folk of arkham would not speak much of the blasted heath .
i hurried back before sunset to my hotel , unwilling to have the stars come out above me in the open ; and the next day returned to boston to give up my position .
i could not go into that dim chaos of old forest and slope again , or face another time that grey blasted heath where the black well yawned deep beside the tumbled bricks and stones .
the reservoir will soon be built now , and all those elder secrets will be safe forever under watery fathoms .
but even then i do not believe i would like to visit that country by night at least not when the sinister stars are out ; and nothing could bribe me to drink the new city water of arkham .
it all began , old ammi said , with the meteorite .
before that time there had been no wild legends at all since the witch trials , and even then these western woods were not feared half so much as the small island in the miskatonic where the devil held court beside a curious lone altar older than the indians .
these were not haunted woods , and their fantastic dusk was never terrible till the strange days .
then there had come that white noontide cloud , that string of explosions in the air , and that pillar of smoke from the valley far in the wood .
and by night all arkham had heard of the great rock that fell out of the sky and bedded itself in the ground beside the well at the nahum gardner place .
that was the house which had stood where the blasted heath was to come the trim white nahum gardner house amidst its fertile gardens and orchards .
nahum had come to town to tell people about the stone , and dropped in at ammi pierce on the way .
ammi was forty then , and all the queer things were fixed very strongly in his mind .
he and his wife had gone with the three professors from miskatonic university who hastened out the next morning to see the weird visitor from unknown stellar space , and had wondered why nahum had called it so large the day before .
it had shrunk , nahum said as he pointed out the big brownish mound above the ripped earth and charred grass near the archaic in his front yard ; but the wise men answered that stones do not shrink .
its heat lingered persistently , and nahum declared it had glowed faintly in the night .
the professors tried it with a geologist hammer and found it was oddly soft .
it was , in truth , so soft as to be almost plastic ; and they gouged rather than chipped a specimen to take back to the college for testing .
they took it in an old pail borrowed from nahum kitchen , for even the small piece refused to grow cool .
on the trip back they stopped at ammi to rest , and seemed thoughtful when pierce remarked that the fragment was growing smaller and burning the bottom of the pail .
truly , it was not large , but perhaps they had taken less than they thought .
the day after that all this was in june of the professors had trooped out again in a great excitement .
as they passed ammi they told him what queer things the specimen had done , and how it had faded wholly away when they put it in a glass beaker .
the beaker had gone , too , and the wise men talked of the strange stone affinity for silicon .
it had acted quite unbelievably in that laboratory ; doing nothing at all and showing no occluded gases when heated on charcoal , being wholly negative in the borax bead , and soon proving itself absolutely at any producible temperature , including that of the blowpipe .
on an anvil it appeared highly malleable , and in the dark its luminosity was very marked .
stubbornly refusing to grow cool , it soon had the college in a state of real excitement ; and when upon heating before the spectroscope it displayed shining bands unlike any known colours of the normal spectrum there was much breathless talk of new elements , bizarre optical properties , and other things which puzzled men of science are wont to say when faced by the unknown .
hot as it was , they tested it in a crucible with all the proper reagents .
water did nothing .
hydrochloric acid was the same .
nitric acid and even aqua regia merely hissed and spattered against its torrid invulnerability .
ammi had difficulty in recalling all these things , but recognized some solvents as i mentioned them in the usual order of use .
there were ammonia and caustic soda , alcohol and ether , nauseous carbon disulphide and a dozen others ; but although the weight grew steadily less as time passed , and the fragment seemed to be slightly cooling , there was no change in the solvents to show that they had attacked the substance at all .
it was a metal , though , beyond a doubt .
it was magnetic , for one thing ; and after its immersion in the acid solvents there seemed to be faint traces of the widmanstatten figures found on meteoric iron .
when the cooling had grown very considerable , the testing was carried on in glass ; and it was in a glass beaker that they left all the chips made of the original fragment during the work .
the next morning both chips and beaker were gone without trace , and only a charred spot marked the place on the wooden shelf where they had been .
all this the professors told ammi as they paused at his door , and once more he went with them to see the stony messenger from the stars , though this time his wife did not accompany him .
it had now most certainly shrunk , and even the sober professors could not doubt the truth of what they saw .
all around the dwindling brown lump near the well was a vacant space , except where the earth had caved in ; and whereas it had been a good seven feet across the day before , it was now scarcely five .
it was still hot , and the sages studied its surface curiously as they detached another and larger piece with hammer and chisel .
they gouged deeply this time , and as they pried away the smaller mass they saw that the core of the thing was not quite homogeneous .
they had uncovered what seemed to be the side of a large coloured globule embedded in the substance .
the colour , which resembled some of the bands in the meteor strange spectrum , was almost impossible to describe ; and it was only by analogy that they called it colour at all .
its texture was glossy , and upon tapping it appeared to promise both brittleness and hollowness .
one of the professors gave it a smart blow with a hammer , and it burst with a nervous little pop .
nothing was emitted , and all trace of the thing vanished with the puncturing .
it left behind a hollow spherical space about three inches across , and all thought it probable that others would be discovered as the enclosing substance wasted away .
conjecture was vain ; so after a futile attempt to find additional globules by drilling , the seekers left again with their new specimen which proved , however , as baffling in the laboratory as its predecessor .
aside from being almost plastic , having heat , magnetism , and slight luminosity , cooling slightly in powerful acids , possessing an unknown spectrum , wasting away in air , and attacking silicon compounds with mutual destruction as a result , it presented no identifying features whatsoever ; and at the end of the tests the college scientists were forced to own that they could not place it .
it was nothing of this earth , but a piece of the great outside ; and as such dowered with outside properties and obedient to outside laws .
that night there was a thunderstorm , and when the professors went out to nahum the next day they met with a bitter disappointment .
the stone , magnetic as it had been , must have had some peculiar electrical property ; for it had drawn the lightning , as nahum said , with a singular persistence .
six times within an hour the farmer saw the lightning strike the furrow in the front yard , and when the storm was over nothing remained but a ragged pit by the ancient , with a earth .
digging had borne no fruit , and the scientists verified the fact of the utter vanishment .
the failure was total ; so that nothing was left to do but go back to the laboratory and test again the disappearing fragment left carefully cased in lead .
that fragment lasted a week , at the end of which nothing of value had been learned of it .
when it had gone , no residue was left behind , and in time the professors felt scarcely sure they had indeed seen with waking eyes that cryptic vestige of the fathomless gulfs outside ; that lone , weird message from other universes and other realms of matter , force , and entity .
as was natural , the arkham papers made much of the incident with its collegiate sponsoring , and sent reporters to talk with nahum gardner and his family .
at least one boston daily also sent a scribe , and nahum quickly became a kind of local celebrity .
he was a lean , genial person of about fifty , living with his wife and three sons on the pleasant farmstead in the valley .
he and ammi exchanged visits frequently , as did their wives ; and ammi had nothing but praise for him after all these years .
he seemed slightly proud of the notice his place had attracted , and talked often of the meteorite in the succeeding weeks .
that july and august were hot ; and nahum worked hard at his haying in the pasture across chapman brook ; his rattling wain wearing deep ruts in the shadowy lanes between .
the labour tired him more than it had in other years , and he felt that age was beginning to tell on him .
then fell the time of fruit and harvest .
the pears and apples slowly ripened , and nahum vowed that his orchards were prospering as never before .
the fruit was growing to phenomenal size and unwonted gloss , and in such abundance that extra barrels were ordered to handle the future crop .
but with the ripening came sore disappointment , for of all that gorgeous array of specious lusciousness not one single jot was fit to eat .
into the fine flavour of the pears and apples had crept a stealthy bitterness and sickishness , so that even the smallest bites induced a lasting disgust .
it was the same with the melons and tomatoes , and nahum sadly saw that his entire crop was lost .
quick to connect events , he declared that the meteorite had poisoned the soil , and thanked heaven that most of the other crops were in the upland lot along the road .
winter came early , and was very cold .
ammi saw nahum less often than usual , and observed that he had begun to look worried .
the rest of his family too , seemed to have grown taciturn ; and were far from steady in their or their attendance at the various social events of the countryside .
for this reserve or melancholy no cause could be found , though all the household confessed now and then to poorer health and a feeling of vague disquiet .
nahum himself gave the most definite statement of anyone when he said he was disturbed about certain footprints in the snow .
they were the usual winter prints of red squirrels , white rabbits , and foxes , but the brooding farmer professed to see something not quite right about their nature and arrangement .
he was never specific , but appeared to think that they were not as characteristic of the anatomy and habits of squirrels and rabbits and foxes as they ought to be .
ammi listened without interest to this talk until one night when he drove past nahum house in his sleigh on the way back from clark comer .
there had been a moon , and a rabbit had run across the road , and the leaps of that rabbit were longer than either ammi or his horse liked .
the latter , indeed , had almost run away when brought up by a firm rein .
thereafter ammi gave nahum tales more respect , and wondered why the gardner dogs seemed so cowed and quivering every morning .
they had , it developed , nearly lost the spirit to bark .
in february the mcgregor boys from meadow hill were out shooting woodchucks , and not far from the gardner place bagged a very peculiar specimen .
the proportions of its body seemed slightly altered in a queer way impossible to describe , while its face had taken on an expression which no one ever saw in a woodchuck before .
the boys were genuinely frightened , and threw the thing away at once , so that only their grotesque tales of it ever reached the people of the countryside .
but the shying of horses near nahum house had now become an acknowledged thing , and all the basis for a cycle of whispered legend was fast taking form .
people vowed that the snow melted faster around nahum than it did anywhere else , and early in march there was an awed discussion in potter general store at clark corners .
stephen rice had driven past gardner in the morning , and had noticed the coming up through the mud by the woods across the road .
never were things of such size seen before , and they held strange colours that could not be put into any words .
their shapes were monstrous , and the horse had snorted at an odour which struck stephen as wholly unprecedented .
that afternoon several persons drove past to see the abnormal growth , and all agreed that plants of that kind ought never to sprout in a healthy world .
the bad fruit of the fall before was freely mentioned , and it went from mouth to mouth that there was poison in nahum ground .
of course it was the meteorite ; and remembering how strange the men from the college had found that stone to be , several farmers spoke about the matter to them .
one day they paid nahum a visit ; but having no love of wild tales and folklore were very conservative in what they inferred .
the plants were certainly odd , but all are more or less odd in shape and hue .
perhaps some mineral element from the stone had entered the soil , but it would soon be washed away .
and as for the footprints and frightened horses of course this was mere country talk which such a phenomenon as the aerolite would be certain to start .
there was really nothing for serious men to do in cases of wild gossip , for superstitious rustics will say and believe anything .
and so all through the strange days the professors stayed away in contempt .
only one of them , when given two phials of dust for analysis in a police job over a year and half later , recalled that the queer colour of that had been very like one of the anomalous bands of light shown by the meteor fragment in the college spectroscope , and like the brittle globule found imbedded in the stone from the abyss .
the samples in this analysis case gave the same odd bands at first , though later they lost the property .
the trees budded prematurely around nahum , and at night they swayed ominously in the wind .
nahum second son thaddeus , a lad of fifteen , swore that they swayed also when there was no wind ; but even the gossips would not credit this .
certainly , however , restlessness was in the air .
the entire gardner family developed the habit of stealthy listening , though not for any sound which they could consciously name .
the listening was , indeed , rather a product of moments when consciousness seemed half to slip away .
unfortunately such moments increased week by week , till it became common speech that something was wrong with all nahum folks .
when the early saxifrage came out it had another strange colour ; not quite like that of the , but plainly related and equally unknown to anyone who saw it .
nahum took some blossoms to arkham and showed them to the editor of the gazette , but that dignitary did no more than write a humorous article about them , in which the dark fears of rustics were held up to polite ridicule .
it was a mistake of nahum to tell a stolid city man about the way the great , overgrown butterflies behaved in connection with these saxifrages .
april brought a kind of madness to the country folk , and began that disuse of the road past nahum which led to its ultimate abandonment .
it was the vegetation .
all the orchard trees blossomed forth in strange colours , and through the stony soil of the yard and adjacent pasturage there sprang up a bizarre growth which only a botanist could connect with the proper flora of the region .
no sane wholesome colours were anywhere to be seen except in the green grass and leafage ; but everywhere were those hectic and prismatic variants of some diseased , underlying primary tone without a place among the known tints of earth .
the dutchman breeches became a thing of sinister menace , and the bloodroots grew insolent in their chromatic perversion .
ammi and the gardners thought that most of the colours had a sort of haunting familiarity , and decided that they reminded one of the brittle globule in the meteor .
nahum ploughed and sowed the pasture and the upland lot , but did nothing with the land around the house .
he knew it would be of no use , and hoped that the summer strange growths would draw all the poison from the soil .
he was prepared for almost anything now , and had grown used to the sense of something near him waiting to be heard .
the shunning of his house by neighbors told on him , of course ; but it told on his wife more .
the boys were better off , being at school each day ; but they could not help being frightened by the gossip .
thaddeus , an especially sensitive youth , suffered the most .
in may the insects came , and nahum place became a nightmare of buzzing and crawling .
most of the creatures seemed not quite usual in their aspects and motions , and their nocturnal habits contradicted all former experience .
the gardners took to watching at night watching in all directions at random for something they could not tell what .
it was then that they owned that thaddeus had been right about the trees .
gardner was the next to see it from the window as she watched the swollen boughs of a maple against a moonlit sky .
the boughs surely moved , and there was no wind .
it must be the sap .
strangeness had come into everything growing now .
yet it was none of nahum family at all who made the next discovery .
familiarity had dulled them , and what they could not see was glimpsed by a timid windmill salesman from bolton who drove by one night in ignorance of the country legends .
what he told in arkham was given a short paragraph in the gazette ; and it was there that all the farmers , nahum included , saw it first .
the night had been dark and the faint , but around a farm in the valley which everyone knew from the account must be nahum , the darkness had been less thick .
a dim though distinct luminosity seemed to inhere in all the vegetation , grass , leaves , and blossoms alike , while at one moment a detached piece of the phosphorescence appeared to stir furtively in the yard near the barn .
the grass had so far seemed untouched , and the cows were freely pastured in the lot near the house , but toward the end of may the milk began to be bad .
then nahum had the cows driven to the uplands , after which this trouble ceased .
not long after this the change in grass and leaves became apparent to the eye .
all the verdure was going grey , and was developing a highly singular quality of brittleness .
ammi was now the only person who ever visited the place , and his visits were becoming fewer and fewer .
when school closed the gardners were virtually cut off from the world , and sometimes let ammi do their errands in town .
they were failing curiously both physically and mentally , and no one was surprised when the news of gardner madness stole around .
it happened in june , about the anniversary of the meteor fall , and the poor woman screamed about things in the air which she could not describe .
in her raving there was not a single specific noun , but only verbs and pronouns .
things moved and changed and fluttered , and ears tingled to impulses which were not wholly sounds .
something was taken away she was being drained of something something was fastening itself on her that ought not to be someone must make it keep off nothing was ever still in the night the walls and windows shifted .
nahum did not send her to the county asylum , but let her wander about the house as long as she was harmless to herself and others .
even when her expression changed he did nothing .
but when the boys grew afraid of her , and thaddeus nearly fainted at the way she made faces at him , he decided to keep her locked in the attic .
by july she had ceased to speak and crawled on all fours , and before that month was over nahum got the mad notion that she was slightly luminous in the dark , as he now clearly saw was the case with the nearby vegetation .
it was a little before this that the horses had stampeded .
something had aroused them in the night , and their neighing and kicking in their stalls had been terrible .
there seemed virtually nothing to do to calm them , and when nahum opened the stable door they all bolted out like frightened woodland deer .
it took a week to track all four , and when found they were seen to be quite useless and unmanageable .
something had snapped in their brains , and each one had to be shot for its own good .
nahum borrowed a horse from ammi for his haying , but found it would not approach the barn .
it shied , balked , and whinnied , and in the end he could do nothing but drive it into the yard while the men used their own strength to get the heavy wagon near enough the hayloft for convenient pitching .
and all the while the vegetation was turning grey and brittle .
even the flowers whose hues had been so strange were greying now , and the fruit was coming out grey and dwarfed and tasteless .
the asters and bloomed grey and distorted , and the roses and zinneas and hollyhocks in the front yard were such things that nahum oldest boy zenas cut them down .
the strangely puffed insects died about that time , even the bees that had left their hives and taken to the woods .
by september all the vegetation was fast crumbling to a greyish powder , and nahum feared that the trees would die before the poison was out of the soil .
his wife now had spells of terrific screaming , and he and the boys were in a constant state of nervous tension .
they shunned people now , and when school opened the boys did not go .
but it was ammi , on one of his rare visits , who first realised that the well water was no longer good .
it had an evil taste that was not exactly fetid nor exactly salty , and ammi advised his friend to dig another well on higher ground to use till the soil was good again .
nahum , however , ignored the warning , for he had by that time become calloused to strange and unpleasant things .
he and the boys continued to use the tainted supply , drinking it as listlessly and mechanically as they ate their meagre and meals and did their thankless and monotonous chores through the aimless days .
there was something of stolid resignation about them all , as if they walked half in another world between lines of nameless guards to a certain and familiar doom .
thaddeus went mad in september after a visit to the well .
he had gone with a pail and had come back , shrieking and waving his arms , and sometimes lapsing into an inane titter or a whisper about the moving colours down there .
two in one family was pretty bad , but nahum was very brave about it .
he let the boy run about for a week until he began stumbling and hurting himself , and then he shut him in an attic room across the hall from his mother .
the way they screamed at each other from behind their locked doors was very terrible , especially to little merwin , who fancied they talked in some terrible language that was not of earth .
merwin was getting frightfully imaginative , and his restlessness was worse after the shutting away of the brother who had been his greatest playmate .
almost at the same time the mortality among the livestock commenced .
poultry turned greyish and died very quickly , their meat being found dry and noisome upon cutting .
hogs grew inordinately fat , then suddenly began to undergo loathsome changes which no one could explain .
their meat was of course useless , and nahum was at his wit end .
no rural veterinary would approach his place , and the city veterinary from arkham was openly baffled .
the swine began growing grey and brittle and falling to pieces before they died , and their eyes and muzzles developed singular alterations .
it was very inexplicable , for they had never been fed from the tainted vegetation .
then something struck the cows .
certain areas or sometimes the whole body would be uncannily shrivelled or compressed , and atrocious collapses or disintegrations were common .
in the last stages and death was always the result there would be a greying and turning brittle like that which beset the hogs .
there could be no question of poison , for all the cases occurred in a locked and undisturbed barn .
no bites of prowling things could have brought the virus , for what live beast of earth can pass through solid obstacles ?
it must be only natural disease yet what disease could wreak such results was beyond any mind guessing .
when the harvest came there was not an animal surviving on the place , for the stock and poultry were dead and the dogs had run away .
these dogs , three in number , had all vanished one night and were never heard of again .
the five cats had left some time before , but their going was scarcely noticed since there now seemed to be no mice , and only gardner had made pets of the graceful felines .
on the nineteenth of october nahum staggered into ammi house with hideous news .
the death had come to poor thaddeus in his attic room , and it had come in a way which could not be told .
nahum had dug a grave in the railed family plot behind the farm , and had put therein what he found .
there could have been nothing from outside , for the small barred window and locked door were intact ; but it was much as it had been in the barn .
ammi and his wife consoled the stricken man as best they could , but shuddered as they did so .
stark terror seemed to cling round the gardners and all they touched , and the very presence of one in the house was a breath from regions unnamed and unnamable .
ammi accompanied nahum home with the greatest reluctance , and did what he might to calm the hysterical sobbing of little merwin .
zenas needed no calming .
he had come of late to do nothing but stare into space and obey what his father told him ; and ammi thought that his fate was very merciful .
now and then merwin screams were answered faintly from the attic , and in response to an inquiring look nahum said that his wife was getting very feeble .
when night approached , ammi managed to get away ; for not even friendship could make him stay in that spot when the faint glow of the vegetation began and the trees may or may not have swayed without wind .
it was really lucky for ammi that he was not more imaginative .
even as things were , his mind was bent ever so slightly ; but had he been able to connect and reflect upon all the portents around him he must inevitably have turned a total maniac .
in the twilight he hastened home , the screams of the mad woman and the nervous child ringing horribly in his ears .
three days later nahum burst into ammi kitchen in the early morning , and in the absence of his host stammered out a desperate tale once more , while pierce listened in a clutching fright .
it was little merwin this time .
he was gone .
he had gone out late at night with a lantern and pail for water , and had never come back .
he been going to pieces for days , and hardly knew what he was about .
screamed at everything .
there had been a frantic shriek from the yard then , but before the father could get to the door the boy was gone .
there was no glow from the lantern he had taken , and of the child himself no trace .
at the time nahum thought the lantern and pail were gone too ; but when dawn came , and the man had plodded back from his search of the woods and fields , he had found some very curious things near the well .
there was a crushed and apparently somewhat melted mass of iron which had certainly been the lantern ; while a bent handle and twisted iron hoops beside it , both , seemed to hint at the remnants of the pail .
that was all .
nahum was past imagining , pierce was blank , and ammi , when he had reached home and heard the tale , could give no guess .
merwin was gone , and there would be no use in telling the people around , who shunned all gardners now .
no use , either , in telling the city people at arkham who laughed at everything .
thad was gone , and now merwin was gone .
something was creeping and creeping and waiting to be seen and heard .
nahum would go soon , and he wanted ammi to look after his wife and zenas if they survived him .
it must all be a judgment of some sort ; though he could not fancy what for , since he had always walked uprightly in the lord ways so far as he knew .
for over two weeks ammi saw nothing of nahum ; and then , worried about what might have happened , he overcame his fears and paid the gardner place a visit .
there was no smoke from the great chimney , and for a moment the visitor was apprehensive of the worst .
the aspect of the whole farm was shocking greyish withered grass and leaves on the ground , vines falling in brittle wreckage from archaic walls and gables , and great bare trees clawing up at the grey november sky with a studied malevolence which ammi could not but feel had come from some subtle change in the tilt of the branches .
but nahum was alive , after all .
he was weak , and lying on a couch in the kitchen , but perfectly conscious and able to give simple orders to zenas .
the room was deadly cold ; and as ammi visibly shivered , the host shouted huskily to zenas for more wood .
wood , indeed , was sorely needed ; since the cavernous fireplace was unlit and empty , with a cloud of soot blowing about in the chill wind that came down the chimney .
presently nahum asked him if the extra wood had made him any more comfortable , and then ammi saw what had happened .
the stoutest cord had broken at last , and the hapless farmer mind was proof against more sorrow .
questioning tactfully , ammi could get no clear data at all about the missing zenas .
in the well he lives in the well was all that the clouded father would say .
then there flashed across the visitor mind a sudden thought of the mad wife , and he changed his line of inquiry .
nabby ?
why , here she is !
was the surprised response of poor nahum , and ammi soon saw that he must search for himself .
leaving the harmless babbler on the couch , he took the keys from their nail beside the door and climbed the creaking stairs to the attic .
it was very close and noisome up there , and no sound could be heard from any direction .
of the four doors in sight , only one was locked , and on this he tried various keys of the ring he had taken .
the third key proved the right one , and after some fumbling ammi threw open the low white door .
it was quite dark inside , for the window was small and by the crude wooden bars ; and ammi could see nothing at all on the floor .
the stench was beyond enduring , and before proceeding further he had to retreat to another room and return with his lungs filled with breathable air .
when he did enter he saw something dark in the corner , and upon seeing it more clearly he screamed outright .
while he screamed he thought a momentary cloud eclipsed the window , and a second later he felt himself brushed as if by some hateful current of vapour .
strange colours danced before his eyes ; and had not a present horror numbed him he would have thought of the globule in the meteor that the geologist hammer had shattered , and of the morbid vegetation that had sprouted in the spring .
as it was he thought only of the blasphemous monstrosity which confronted him , and which all too clearly had shared the nameless fate of young thaddeus and the livestock .
but the terrible thing about the horror was that it very slowly and perceptibly moved as it continued to crumble .
ammi would give me no added particulars of this scene , but the shape in the comer does not reappear in his tale as a moving object .
there are things which can not be mentioned , and what is done in common humanity is sometimes cruelly judged by the law .
i gathered that no moving thing was left in that attic room , and that to leave anything capable of motion there would have been a deed so monstrous as to damn any accountable being to eternal torment .
anyone but a stolid farmer would have fainted or gone mad , but ammi walked conscious through that low doorway and locked the accursed secret behind him .
there would be nahum to deal with now ; he must be fed and tended , and removed to some place where he could be cared for .
commencing his descent of the dark stairs .
ammi heard a thud below him .
he even thought a scream had been suddenly choked off , and recalled nervously the clammy vapour which had brushed by him in that frightful room above .
what presence had his cry and entry started up ?
halted by some vague fear , he heard still further sounds below .
indubitably there was a sort of heavy dragging , and a most detestably sticky noise as of some fiendish and unclean species of suction .
with an associative sense goaded to feverish heights , he thought unaccountably of what he had seen upstairs .
good god !
what eldritch was this into which he had blundered ?
he dared move neither backward nor forward , but stood there trembling at the black curve of the staircase .
every trifle of the scene burned itself into his brain .
the sounds , the sense of dread expectancy , the darkness , the steepness of the narrow step and merciful heaven ! the faint but unmistakable luminosity of all the woodwork in sight ; steps , sides , exposed laths , and beams alike .
then there burst forth a frantic whinny from ammi horse outside , followed at once by a clatter which told of a frenzied runaway .
in another moment horse and buggy had gone beyond earshot , leaving the frightened man on the dark stairs to guess what had sent them .
but that was not all .
there had been another sound out there .
a sort of liquid splash water it must have been the well .
he had left hero untied near it , and a buggy wheel must have brushed the coping and knocked in a stone .
and still the pale phosphorescence glowed in that detestably ancient woodwork .
god !
how old the house was !
most of it built before , and the gambrel roof no later than .
a feeble scratching on the floor downstairs now sounded distinctly , and ammi grip tightened on a heavy stick he had picked up in the attic for some purpose .
slowly nerving himself , he finished his descent and walked boldly toward the kitchen .
but he did not complete the walk , because what he sought was no longer there .
it had come to meet him , and it was still alive after a fashion .
whether it had crawled or whether it had been dragged by any external forces , ammi could not say ; but the death had been at it .
everything had happened in the last , but collapse , greying , and disintegration were already far advanced .
there was a horrible brittleness , and dry fragments were scaling off .
ammi could not touch it , but looked horrifiedly into the distorted parody that had been a face .
what was it , nahum what was it ?
he whispered , and the cleft , bulging lips were just able to crackle out a final answer .
nothin ' nothin ' the colour it burns cold an ' wet , but it burns it lived in the well i seen it a kind of smoke jest like the flowers last spring the well shone at night thad an ' merwin an ' zenas everything alive suckin ' the life out of everything in that stone it must a ' come in that stone pizened the whole place du know what it wants that round thing them men from the college dug outen the stone they smashed it it was the same colour jest the same , like the flowers an ' plants must a ' ben more of seeds seeds they growed i seen it the fust time this week must a ' got strong on zenas he was a big boy , full o ' life it beats down your mind an ' then gets ye burns ye up in the well water you was right about that evil water zenas never come back from the well ca git away draws ye ye know comin ' but tai no use i seen it time an ' agin senct zenas was took whar nabby , ammi ? my head no good du know how long sense i fed her it git her ef we ai keerful jest a colour her face is gittin ' to hev that colour sometimes towards night an ' it burns an ' sucks it come from some place whar things ai as they is here one o ' them professors said so he was right look out , ammi , it do suthin ' more sucks the life out but that was all .
that which spoke could speak no more because it had completely caved in .
ammi laid a red checked tablecloth over what was left and reeled out the back door into the fields .
he climbed the slope to the pasture and stumbled home by the north road and the woods .
he could not pass that well from which his horses had run away .
he had looked at it through the window , and had seen that no stone was missing from the rim .
then the lurching buggy had not dislodged anything after all the splash had been something else something which went into the well after it had done with poor nahum .
when ammi reached his house the horses and buggy had arrived before him and thrown his wife into fits of anxiety .
reassuring her without explanations , he set out at once for arkham and notified the authorities that the gardner family was no more .
he indulged in no details , but merely told of the deaths of nahum and nabby , that of thaddeus being already known , and mentioned that the cause seemed to be the same strange ailment which had killed the .
he also stated that merwin and zenas had disappeared .
there was considerable questioning at the police station , and in the end ammi was compelled to take three officers to the gardner farm , together with the coroner , the medical examiner , and the veterinary who had treated the diseased animals .
he went much against his will , for the afternoon was advancing and he feared the fall of night over that accursed place , but it was some comfort to have so many people with him .
the six men drove out in a , following ammi buggy , and arrived at the farmhouse about four .
used as the officers were to gruesome experiences , not one remained unmoved at what was found in the attic and under the red checked tablecloth on the floor below .
the whole aspect of the farm with its grey desolation was terrible enough , but those two crumbling objects were beyond all bounds .
no one could look long at them , and even the medical examiner admitted that there was very little to examine .
specimens could be analysed , of course , so he busied himself in obtaining them and here it develops that a very puzzling aftermath occurred at the college laboratory where the two phials of dust were finally taken .
under the spectroscope both samples gave off an unknown spectrum , in which many of the baffling bands were precisely like those which the strange meteor had yielded in the previous year .
the property of emitting this spectrum vanished in a month , the dust thereafter consisting mainly of alkaline phosphates and carbonates .
ammi would not have told the men about the well if he had thought they meant to do anything then and there .
it was getting toward sunset , and he was anxious to be away .
but he could not help glancing nervously at the stony curb by the great sweep , and when a detective questioned him he admitted that nahum had feared something down there so much so that he had never even thought of searching it for merwin or zenas .
after that nothing would do but that they empty and explore the well immediately , so ammi had to wait trembling while pail after pail of rank water was hauled up and splashed on the soaking ground outside .
the men sniffed in disgust at the fluid , and toward the last held their noses against the foetor they were uncovering .
it was not so long a job as they had feared it would be , since the water was phenomenally low .
there is no need to speak too exactly of what they found .
merwin and zenas were both there , in part , though the vestiges were mainly skeletal .
there were also a small deer and a large dog in about the same state , and a number of bones of small animals .
the ooze and slime at the bottom seemed inexplicably porous and bubbling , and a man who descended on with a long pole found that he could sink the wooden shaft to any depth in the mud of the floor without meeting any solid obstruction .
twilight had now fallen , and lanterns were brought from the house .
then , when it was seen that nothing further could be gained from the well , everyone went indoors and conferred in the ancient while the intermittent light of a spectral played wanly on the grey desolation outside .
the men were frankly nonplussed by the entire case , and could find no convincing common element to link the strange vegetable conditions , the unknown disease of and humans , and the unaccountable deaths of merwin and zenas in the tainted well .
they had heard the common country talk , it is true ; but could not believe that anything contrary to natural law had occurred .
no doubt the meteor had poisoned the soil , but the illness of persons and animals who had eaten nothing grown in that soil was another matter .
was it the well water ?
very possibly .
it might be a good idea to analyze it .
but what peculiar madness could have made both boys jump into the well ?
their deeds were so the fragments showed that they had both suffered from the grey brittle death .
why was everything so grey and brittle ?
it was the coroner , seated near a window overlooking the yard , who first noticed the glow about the well .
night had fully set in , and all the abhorrent grounds seemed faintly luminous with more than the fitful moonbeams ; but this new glow was something definite and distinct , and appeared to shoot up from the black pit like a softened ray from a searchlight , giving dull reflections in the little ground pools where the water had been emptied .
it had a very queer colour , and as all the men clustered round the window ammi gave a violent start .
for this strange beam of ghastly miasma was to him of no unfamiliar hue .
he had seen that colour before , and feared to think what it might mean .
he had seen it in the nasty brittle globule in that aerolite two summers ago , had seen it in the crazy vegetation of the springtime , and had thought he had seen it for an instant that very morning against the small barred window of that terrible attic room where nameless things had happened .
it had flashed there a second , and a clammy and hateful current of vapour had brushed past him and then poor nahum had been taken by something of that colour .
he had said so at the last said it was like the globule and the plants .
after that had come the runaway in the yard and the splash in the well and now that well was belching forth to the night a pale insidious beam of the same demoniac tint .
it does credit to the alertness of ammi mind that he puzzled even at that tense moment over a point which was essentially scientific .
he could not but wonder at his gleaning of the same impression from a vapour glimpsed in the daytime , against a window opening on the morning sky , and from a nocturnal exhalation seen as a phosphorescent mist against the black and blasted landscape .
it was right it was against nature and he thought of those terrible last words of his stricken friend , it come from some place whar things ai as they is here one o ' them professors said so all three horses outside , tied to a pair of shrivelled saplings by the road , were now neighing and pawing frantically .
the wagon driver started for the door to do something , but ammi laid a shaky hand on his shoulder .
du go out thar , he whispered .
they more to this nor what we know .
nahum said somethin ' lived in the well that sucks your life out .
he said it must be growed from a round ball like one we all seen in the meteor stone that fell a year ago june .
sucks an ' burns , he said , an ' is jest a cloud of colour like that light out thar now , that ye can hardly see an ' ca tell what it is .
nahum thought it feeds on everything livin ' an ' gits stronger all the time .
he said he seen it this last week .
it must be somethin ' from away off in the sky like the men from the college last year says the meteor stone was .
the way it made an ' the way it works ai like no way o ' god world .
it from beyond .
so the men paused indecisively as the light from the well grew stronger and the hitched horses pawed and whinnied in increasing frenzy .
it was truly an awful moment ; with terror in that ancient and accursed house itself , four monstrous sets of fragments two from the house and two from the well in the woodshed behind , and that shaft of unknown and unholy iridescence from the slimy depths in front .
ammi had restrained the driver on impulse , forgetting how uninjured he himself was after the clammy brushing of that coloured vapour in the attic room , but perhaps it is just as well that he acted as he did .
no one will ever know what was abroad that night ; and though the blasphemy from beyond had not so far hurt any human of unweakened mind , there is no telling what it might not have done at that last moment , and with its seemingly increased strength and the special signs of purpose it was soon to display beneath the moonlit sky .
all at once one of the detectives at the window gave a short , sharp gasp .
the others looked at him , and then quickly followed his own gaze upward to the point at which its idle straying had been suddenly arrested .
there was no need for words .
what had been disputed in country gossip was disputable no longer , and it is because of the thing which every man of that party agreed in whispering later on , that the strange days are never talked about in arkham .
it is necessary to premise that there was no wind at that hour of the evening .
one did arise not long afterward , but there was absolutely none then .
even the dry tips of the lingering , grey and blighted , and the fringe on the roof of the standing were unstirred .
and yet amid that tense godless calm the high bare boughs of all the trees in the yard were moving .
they were twitching morbidly and spasmodically , clawing in convulsive and epileptic madness at the moonlit clouds ; scratching impotently in the noxious air as if jerked by some allied and bodiless line of linkage with subterrene horrors writhing and struggling below the black roots .
not a man breathed for several seconds .
then a cloud of darker depth passed over the moon , and the silhouette of clutching branches faded out momentarily .
at this there was a general cry ; muffled with awe , but husky and almost identical from every throat .
for the terror had not faded with the silhouette , and in a fearsome instant of deeper darkness the watchers saw wriggling at that tree top height a thousand tiny points of faint and unhallowed radiance , tipping each bough like the fire of elmo or the flames that come down on the apostles ' heads at pentecost .
it was a monstrous constellation of unnatural light , like a glutted swarm of fireflies dancing hellish sarabands over an accursed marsh , and its colour was that same nameless intrusion which ammi had come to recognize and dread .
all the while the shaft of phosphorescence from the well was getting brighter and brighter , bringing to the minds of the huddled men , a sense of doom and abnormality which far outraced any image their conscious minds could form .
it was no longer shining out ; it was pouring out ; and as the shapeless stream of unplaceable colour left the well it seemed to flow directly into the sky .
the veterinary shivered , and walked to the front door to drop the heavy extra bar across it .
ammi shook no less , and had to tug and point for lack of controllable voice when he wished to draw notice to the growing luminosity of the trees .
the neighing and stamping of the horses had become utterly frightful , but not a soul of that group in the old house would have ventured forth for any earthly reward .
with the moments the shining of the trees increased , while their restless branches seemed to strain more and more toward verticality .
the wood of the was shining now , and presently a policeman dumbly pointed to some wooden sheds and near the stone wall on the west .
they were commencing to shine , too , though the tethered vehicles of the visitors seemed so far unaffected .
then there was a wild commotion and clopping in the road , and as ammi quenched the lamp for better seeing they realized that the span of frantic greys had broken their sapling and run off with the .
the shock served to loosen several tongues , and embarrassed whispers were exchanged .
it spreads on everything organic that been around here , muttered the medical examiner .
no one replied , but the man who had been in the well gave a hint that his long pole must have stirred up something intangible .
it was awful , he added .
there was no bottom at all .
just ooze and bubbles and the feeling of something lurking under there .
ammi horse still pawed and screamed deafeningly in the road outside , and nearly drowned its owner faint quaver as he mumbled his formless reflections .
it come from that stone it growed down thar it got everything livin ' it fed itself on , mind and body thad an ' merwin , zenas an ' nabby nahum was the last they all drunk the water it got strong on it come from beyond , whar things ai like they be here now it goin ' home at this point , as the column of unknown colour flared suddenly stronger and began to weave itself into fantastic suggestions of shape which each spectator described differently , there came from poor tethered hero such a sound as no man before or since ever heard from a horse .
every person in that sitting room stopped his ears , and ammi turned away from the window in horror and nausea .
words could not convey it when ammi looked out again the hapless beast lay huddled inert on the moonlit ground between the splintered shafts of the buggy .
that was the last of hero till they buried him next day .
but the present was no time to mourn , for almost at this instant a detective silently called attention to something terrible in the very room with them .
in the absence of the lamplight it was clear that a faint phosphorescence had begun to pervade the entire apartment .
it glowed on the floor and the fragment of rag carpet , and shimmered over the sashes of the windows .
it ran up and down the exposed , coruscated about the shelf and mantel , and infected the very doors and furniture .
each minute saw it strengthen , and at last it was very plain that healthy living things must leave that house .
ammi showed them the back door and the path up through the fields to the pasture .
they walked and stumbled as in a dream , and did not dare look back till they were far away on the high ground .
they were glad of the path , for they could not have gone the front way , by that well .
it was bad enough passing the glowing barn and sheds , and those shining orchard trees with their gnarled , fiendish contours ; but thank heaven the branches did their worst twisting high up .
the moon went under some very black clouds as they crossed the rustic bridge over chapman brook , and it was blind groping from there to the open meadows .
when they looked back toward the valley and the distant gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight .
at the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour ; trees , buildings , and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness .
the boughs were all straining skyward , tipped with tongues of foul flame , and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house , barn and sheds .
it was a scene from a vision of fuseli , and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness , that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the well seething , feeling , lapping , reaching , scintillating , straining , and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognizable chromaticism .
then without warning the hideous thing shot vertically up toward the sky like a rocket or meteor , leaving behind no trail and disappearing through a round and curiously regular hole in the clouds before any man could gasp or cry out .
no watcher can ever forget that sight , and ammi stared blankly at the stars of cygnus , deneb twinkling above the others , where the unknown colour had melted into the milky way .
but his gaze was the next moment called swiftly to earth by the crackling in the valley .
it was just that .
only a wooden ripping and crackling , and not an explosion , as so many others of the party vowed .
yet the outcome was the same , for in one feverish kaleidoscopic instant there burst up from that doomed and accursed farm a gleamingly eruptive cataclysm of unnatural sparks and substance ; blurring the glance of the few who saw it , and sending forth to the zenith a bombarding cloudburst of such coloured and fantastic fragments as our universe must needs disown .
through quickly reclosing vapours they followed the great morbidity that had vanished , and in another second they had vanished too .
behind and below was only a darkness to which the men dared not return , and all about was a mounting wind which seemed to sweep down in black , frore gusts from interstellar space .
it shrieked and howled , and lashed the fields and distorted woods in a mad cosmic frenzy , till soon the trembling party realized it would be no use waiting for the moon to show what was left down there at nahum .
too awed even to hint theories , the seven shaking men trudged back toward arkham by the north road .
ammi was worse than his fellows , and begged them to see him inside his own kitchen , instead of keeping straight on to town .
he did not wish to cross the blighted , woods alone to his home on the main road .
for he had had an added shock that the others were spared , and was crushed forever with a brooding fear he dared not even mention for many years to come .
as the rest of the watchers on that tempestuous hill had stolidly set their faces toward the road , ammi had looked back an instant at the shadowed valley of desolation so lately sheltering his friend .
and from that stricken , spot he had seen something feebly rise , only to sink down again upon the place from which the great shapeless horror had shot into the sky .
it was just a colour but not any colour of our earth or heavens .
and because ammi recognized that colour , and knew that this last faint remnant must still lurk down there in the well , he has never been quite right since .
ammi would never go near the place again .
it is years now since the horror happened , but he has never been there , and will be glad when the new reservoir blots it out .
i shall be glad , too , for i do not like the way the sunlight changed colour around the mouth of that abandoned well i passed .
i hope the water will always be very deep but even so , i shall never drink it .
i do not think i shall visit the arkham country hereafter .
three of the men who had been with ammi returned the next morning to see the ruins by daylight , but there were not any real ruins .
only the bricks of the chimney , the stones of the cellar , some mineral and metallic litter here and there , and the rim of that nefandous well .
save for ammi dead horse , which they towed away and buried , and the buggy which they shortly returned to him , everything that had ever been living had gone .
five eldritch acres of dusty grey desert remained , nor has anything ever grown there since .
to this day it sprawls open to the sky like a great spot eaten by acid in the woods and fields , and the few who have ever dared glimpse it in spite of the rural tales have named it the blasted heath .
the rural tales are queer .
they might be even queerer if city men and college chemists could be interested enough to analyze the water from that disused well , or the grey dust that no wind seems to disperse .
botanists , too , ought to study the stunted flora on the borders of that spot , for they might shed light on the country notion that the blight is spreading little by little , perhaps an inch a year .
people say the colour of the neighboring herbage is not quite right in the spring , and that wild things leave queer prints in the light winter snow .
snow never seems quite so heavy on the blasted heath as it is elsewhere .
horses the few that are left in this motor age grow skittish in the silent valley ; and hunters can not depend on their dogs too near the splotch of greyish dust .
they say the mental influences are very bad , too ; numbers went queer in the years after nahum taking , and always they lacked the power to get away .
then the folk all left the region , and only the foreigners tried to live in the crumbling old homesteads .
they could not stay , though ; and one sometimes wonders what insight beyond ours their wild , weird stories of whispered magic have given them .
their dreams at night , they protest , are very horrible in that grotesque country ; and surely the very look of the dark realm is enough to stir a morbid fancy .
no traveler has ever escaped a sense of strangeness in those deep ravines , and artists shiver as they paint thick woods whose mystery is as much of the spirits as of the eye .
i myself am curious about the sensation i derived from my one lone walk before ammi told me his tale .
when twilight came i had vaguely wished some clouds would gather , for an odd timidity about the deep skyey voids above had crept into my soul .
do not ask me for my opinion .
i do not know that is all .
there was no one but ammi to question ; for arkham people will not talk about the strange days , and all three professors who saw the aerolite and its coloured globule are dead .
there were other globules depend upon that .
one must have fed itself and escaped , and probably there was another which was too late .
no doubt it is still down the well i know there was something wrong with the sunlight i saw above the miasmal brink .
the rustics say the blight creeps an inch a year , so perhaps there is a kind of growth or nourishment even now .
but whatever demon hatchling is there , it must be tethered to something or else it would quickly spread .
is it fastened to the roots of those trees that claw the air ?
one of the current arkham tales is about fat oaks that shine and move as they ought not to do at night .
what it is , only god knows .
in terms of matter i suppose the thing ammi described would be called a gas , but this gas obeyed the laws that are not of our cosmos .
this was no fruit of such worlds and suns as shine on the telescopes and photographic plates of our observatories .
this was no breath from the skies whose motions and dimensions our astronomers measure or deem too vast to measure .
it was just a colour out of space a frightful messenger from unformed realms of infinity beyond all nature as we know it ; from realms whose mere existence stuns the brain and numbs us with the black cosmic gulfs it throws open before our frenzied eyes .
i doubt very much if ammi consciously lied to me , and i do not think his tale was all a freak of madness as the townsfolk had forewarned .
something terrible came to the hills and valleys on that meteor , and something terrible though i know not in what proportion still remains .
i shall be glad to see the water come .
meanwhile i hope nothing will happen to ammi .
he saw so much of the thing and its influence was so insidious .
why has he never been able to move away ?
how clearly he recalled those dying words of nahum ca git away draws ye ye know comin ' but tai no use .
ammi is such a good old man when the reservoir gang gets to work i must write the chief engineer to keep a sharp watch on him .
i would hate to think of him as the grey , twisted , brittle monstrosity which persists more and more in troubling my sleep .
of such great powers or beings there may be conceivably a survival a survival of a hugely remote period when consciousness was manifested , perhaps , in shapes and forms long since withdrawn before the tide of advancing humanity forms of which poetry and legend alone have caught a flying memory and called them gods , monsters , mythical beings of all sorts and kinds algernon blackwood i .
the horror in clay the most merciful thing in the world , i think , is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents .
we live on a placid island of ignorance in the midst of black seas of infinity , and it was not meant that we should voyage far .
the sciences , each straining in its own direction , have hitherto harmed us little ; but some day the piecing together of dissociated knowledge will open up such terrifying vistas of reality , and of our frightful position therein , that we shall either go mad from the revelation or flee from the light into the peace and safety of a new dark age .
theosophists have guessed at the awesome grandeur of the cosmic cycle wherein our world and human race form transient incidents .
they have hinted at strange survivals in terms which would freeze the blood if not masked by a bland optimism .
but it is not from them that there came the single glimpse of forbidden eons which chills me when i think of it and maddens me when i dream of it .
that glimpse , like all dread glimpses of truth , flashed out from an accidental piecing together of separated things in this case an old newspaper item and the notes of a dead professor .
i hope that no one else will accomplish this piecing out ; certainly , if i live , i shall never knowingly supply a link in so hideous a chain .
i think that the professor , too , intended to keep silent regarding the part he knew , and that he would have destroyed his notes had not sudden death seized him .
my knowledge of the thing began in the winter of with the death of my , george gammell angell , professor emeritus of semitic languages in brown university , providence , rhode island .
professor angell was widely known as an authority on ancient inscriptions , and had frequently been resorted to by the heads of prominent museums ; so that his passing at the age of may be recalled by many .
locally , interest was intensified by the obscurity of the cause of death .
the professor had been stricken whilst returning from the newport boat ; falling suddenly ; as witnesses said , after having been jostled by a negro who had come from one of the queer dark courts on the precipitous hillside which formed a short cut from the waterfront to the deceased home in williams street .
physicians were unable to find any visible disorder , but concluded after perplexed debate that some obscure lesion of the heart , induced by the brisk ascent of so steep a hill by so elderly a man , was responsible for the end .
at the time i saw no reason to dissent from this dictum , but latterly i am inclined to wonder and more than wonder .
as my heir and executor , for he died a childless widower , i was expected to go over his papers with some thoroughness ; and for that purpose moved his entire set of files and boxes to my quarters in boston .
much of the material which i correlated will be later published by the american archaeological society , but there was one box which i found exceedingly puzzling , and which i felt much averse from showing to other eyes .
it had been locked and i did not find the key till it occurred to me to examine the personal ring which the professor carried in his pocket .
then , indeed , i succeeded in opening it , but when i did so seemed only to be confronted by a greater and more closely locked barrier .
for what could be the meaning of the queer clay and the disjointed jottings , ramblings , and cuttings which i found ?
had my uncle , in his latter years become credulous of the most superficial impostures ?
i resolved to search out the eccentric sculptor responsible for this apparent disturbance of an old man peace of mind .
the was a rough rectangle less than an inch thick and about five by six inches in area ; obviously of modern origin .
its designs , however , were far from modern in atmosphere and suggestion ; for , although the vagaries of cubism and futurism are many and wild , they do not often reproduce that cryptic regularity which lurks in prehistoric writing .
and writing of some kind the bulk of these designs seemed certainly to be ; though my memory , despite much the papers and collections of my uncle , failed in any way to identify this particular species , or even hint at its remotest affiliations .
above these apparent hieroglyphics was a figure of evident pictorial intent , though its impressionistic execution forbade a very clear idea of its nature .
it seemed to be a sort of monster , or symbol representing a monster , of a form which only a diseased fancy could conceive .
if i say that my somewhat extravagant imagination yielded simultaneous pictures of an octopus , a dragon , and a human caricature , i shall not be unfaithful to the spirit of the thing .
a pulpy , tentacled head surmounted a grotesque and scaly body with rudimentary wings ; but it was the general outline of the whole which made it most shockingly frightful .
behind the figure was a vague suggestions of a cyclopean architectural background .
the writing accompanying this oddity was , aside from a stack of press cuttings , in professor angell most recent hand ; and made no pretense to literary style .
what seemed to be the main document was headed in characters painstakingly printed to avoid the erroneous reading of a word so .
this manuscript was divided into two sections , the first of which was headed dream and dream work of .
wilcox , thomas , providence , r .

the other manuscript papers were brief notes , some of them accounts of the queer dreams of different persons , some of them citations from theosophical books and magazines ( notably atlantis and the lost lemuria ) , and the rest comments on secret societies and hidden cults , with references to passages in such mythological and anthropological as frazer golden bough and miss murray in western europe .
the cuttings largely alluded to outré mental illness and outbreaks of group folly or mania in the spring of .
the first half of the principal manuscript told a very particular tale .
it appears that on march , , a thin , dark young man of neurotic and excited aspect had called upon professor angell bearing the singular clay , which was then exceedingly damp and fresh .
his card bore the name of henry anthony wilcox , and my uncle had recognized him as the youngest son of an excellent family slightly known to him , who had latterly been studying sculpture at the rhode island school of design and living alone at the building near that institution .
wilcox was a precocious youth of known genius but great eccentricity , and had from childhood excited attention through the strange stories and odd dreams he was in the habit of relating .
he called himself psychically hypersensitive , but the staid folk of the ancient commercial city dismissed him as merely queer .
never mingling much with his kind , he had dropped gradually from social visibility , and was now known only to a small group of aesthetes from other towns .
even the providence art club , anxious to preserve its conservatism , had found him quite hopeless .
on the occasion of the visit , ran the professor manuscript , the sculptor abruptly asked for the benefit of his host archeological knowledge in identifying the hieroglyphics of the .
he spoke in a dreamy , stilted manner which suggested pose and alienated sympathy ; and my uncle showed some sharpness in replying , for the conspicuous freshness of the tablet implied kinship with anything but archeology .
young wilcox rejoinder , which impressed my uncle enough to make him recall and record it verbatim , was of a fantastically poetic cast which must have typified his whole conversation , and which i have since found highly characteristic of him .
he said , it is new , indeed , for i made it last night in a dream of strange cities ; and dreams are older than brooding tyre , or the contemplative sphinx , or babylon .
it was then that he began that rambling tale which suddenly played upon a sleeping memory and won the fevered interest of my uncle .
there had been a slight earthquake tremor the night before , the most considerable felt in new england for some years ; and wilcox imagination had been keenly affected .
upon retiring , he had had an unprecedented dream of great cyclopean cities of titan blocks and monoliths , all dripping with green ooze and sinister with latent horror .
hieroglyphics had covered the walls and pillars , and from some undetermined point below had come a voice that was not a voice ; a chaotic sensation which only fancy could transmute into sound , but which he attempted to render by the almost unpronounceable jumble of letters cthulhu fhtagn .
this verbal jumble was the key to the recollection which excited and disturbed professor angell .
he questioned the sculptor with scientific minuteness ; and studied with frantic intensity the on which the youth had found himself working , chilled and clad only in his night clothes , when waking had stolen bewilderingly over him .
my uncle blamed his old age , wilcox afterwards said , for his slowness in recognizing both hieroglyphics and pictorial design .
many of his questions seemed highly out of place to his visitor , especially those which tried to connect the latter with strange cults or societies ; and wilcox could not understand the repeated promises of silence which he was offered in exchange for an admission of membership in some widespread mystical or paganly religious body .
when professor angell became convinced that the sculptor was indeed ignorant of any cult or system of cryptic lore , he besieged his visitor with demands for future reports of dreams .
this bore regular fruit , for after the first interview the manuscript records daily calls of the young man , during which he related startling fragments of nocturnal imaginery whose burden was always some terrible cyclopean vista of dark and dripping stone , with a subterrene voice or intelligence shouting monotonously in enigmatical uninscribable save as gibberish .
the two sounds frequently repeated are those rendered by the letters cthulhu and .
on march , the manuscript continued , wilcox failed to appear ; and inquiries at his quarters revealed that he had been stricken with an obscure sort of fever and taken to the home of his family in waterman street .
he had cried out in the night , arousing several other artists in the building , and had manifested since then only alternations of unconsciousness and delirium .
my uncle at once telephoned the family , and from that time forward kept close watch of the case ; calling often at the thayer street office of tobey , whom he learned to be in charge .
the youth febrile mind , apparently , was dwelling on strange things ; and the doctor shuddered now and then as he spoke of them .
they included not only a repetition of what he had formerly dreamed , but touched wildly on a gigantic thing miles high which walked or lumbered about .
he at no time fully described this object but occasional frantic words , as repeated by tobey , convinced the professor that it must be identical with the nameless monstrosity he had sought to depict in his .
reference to this object , the doctor added , was invariably a prelude to the young man subsidence into lethargy .
his temperature , oddly enough , was not greatly above normal ; but the whole condition was otherwise such as to suggest true fever rather than mental disorder .
on april at about every trace of wilcox malady suddenly ceased .
he sat upright in bed , astonished to find himself at home and completely ignorant of what had happened in dream or reality since the night of march .
pronounced well by his physician , he returned to his quarters in three days ; but to professor angell he was of no further assistance .
all traces of strange dreaming had vanished with his recovery , and my uncle kept no record of his after a week of pointless and irrelevant accounts of thoroughly usual visions .
here the first part of the manuscript ended , but references to certain of the scattered notes gave me much material for thought so much , in fact , that only the ingrained skepticism then forming my philosophy can account for my continued distrust of the artist .
the notes in question were those descriptive of the dreams of various persons covering the same period as that in which young wilcox had had his strange visitations .
my uncle , it seems , had quickly instituted a prodigiously body of inquires amongst nearly all the friends whom he could question without impertinence , asking for nightly reports of their dreams , and the dates of any notable visions for some time past .
the reception of his request seems to have varied ; but he must , at the very least , have received more responses than any ordinary man could have handled without a secretary .
this original correspondence was not preserved , but his notes formed a thorough and really significant digest .
average people in society and business new england traditional salt of the earth gave an almost completely negative result , though scattered cases of uneasy but formless nocturnal impressions appear here and there , always between march and april the period of young wilcox delirium .
scientific men were little more affected , though four cases of vague description suggest fugitive glimpses of strange landscapes , and in one case there is mentioned a dread of something abnormal .
it was from the artists and poets that the pertinent answers came , and i know that panic would have broken loose had they been able to compare notes .
as it was , lacking their original letters , i half suspected the compiler of having asked leading questions , or of having edited the correspondence in corroboration of what he had latently resolved to see .
that is why i continued to feel that wilcox , somehow cognizant of the old data which my uncle had possessed , had been imposing on the veteran scientist .
these responses from esthetes told disturbing tale .
from february to april a large proportion of them had dreamed very bizarre things , the intensity of the dreams being immeasurably the stronger during the period of the sculptor delirium .
over a fourth of those who reported anything , reported scenes and not unlike those which wilcox had described ; and some of the dreamers confessed acute fear of the gigantic nameless thing visible toward the last .
one case , which the note describes with emphasis , was very sad .
the subject , a widely known architect with leanings toward theosophy and occultism , went violently insane on the date of young wilcox seizure , and expired several months later after incessant screamings to be saved from some escaped denizen of hell .
had my uncle referred to these cases by name instead of merely by number , i should have attempted some corroboration and personal investigation ; but as it was , i succeeded in tracing down only a few .
all of these , however , bore out the notes in full .
i have often wondered if all the the objects of the professor questioning felt as puzzled as did this fraction .
it is well that no explanation shall ever reach them .
the press cuttings , as i have intimated , touched on cases of panic , mania , and eccentricity during the given period .
professor angell must have employed a cutting bureau , for the number of extracts was tremendous , and the sources scattered throughout the globe .
here was a nocturnal suicide in london , where a lone sleeper had leaped from a window after a shocking cry .
here likewise a rambling letter to the editor of a paper in south america , where a fanatic deduces a dire future from visions he has seen .
a dispatch from california describes a theosophist colony as donning white robes en masse for some glorious fulfilment which never arrives , whilst items from india speak guardedly of serious native unrest toward the end of march .
the west of ireland , too , is full of wild rumour and legendry , and a fantastic painter named hangs a blasphemous dream landscape in the paris spring salon of .
and so numerous are the recorded troubles in insane asylums that only a miracle can have stopped the medical fraternity from noting strange parallelisms and drawing mystified conclusions .
a weird bunch of cuttings , all told ; and i can at this date scarcely envisage the callous rationalism with which i set them aside .
but i was then convinced that young wilcox had known of the older matters mentioned by the professor .
.
the tale of inspector legrasse the older matters which had made the sculptor dream and so significant to my uncle formed the subject of the second half of his long manuscript .
once before , it appears , professor angell had seen the hellish outlines of the nameless monstrosity , puzzled over the unknown hieroglyphics , and heard the ominous syllables which can be rendered only as cthulhu ; and all this in so stirring and horrible a connection that it is small wonder he pursued young wilcox with queries and demands for data .
this earlier experience had come in , seventeen years before , when the american archaeological society held its annual meeting in louis .
professor angell , as befitted one of his authority and attainments , had had a prominent part in all the deliberations ; and was one of the first to be approached by the several outsiders who took advantage of the convocation to offer questions for correct answering and problems for expert solution .
the chief of these outsiders , and in a short time the focus of interest for the entire meeting , was a man who had travelled all the way from new orleans for certain special information unobtainable from any local source .
his name was john raymond legrasse , and he was by profession an inspector of police .
with him he bore the subject of his visit , a grotesque , repulsive , and apparently very ancient stone statuette whose origin he was at a loss to determine .
it must not be fancied that inspector legrasse had the least interest in archaeology .
on the contrary , his wish for enlightenment was prompted by purely professional considerations .
the statuette , idol , fetish , or whatever it was , had been captured some months before in the wooded swamps south of new orleans during a raid on a supposed voodoo meeting ; and so singular and hideous were the rites connected with it , that the police could not but realise that they had stumbled on a dark cult totally unknown to them , and infinitely more diabolic than even the blackest of the african voodoo circles .
of its origin , apart from the erratic and unbelievable tales extorted from the captured members , absolutely nothing was to be discovered ; hence the anxiety of the police for any antiquarian lore which might help them to place the frightful symbol , and through it track down the cult to its .
inspector legrasse was scarcely prepared for the sensation which his offering created .
one sight of the thing had been enough to throw the assembled men of science into a state of tense excitement , and they lost no time in crowding around him to gaze at the diminutive figure whose utter strangeness and air of genuinely abysmal antiquity hinted so potently at unopened and archaic vistas .
no recognised school of sculpture had animated this terrible object , yet centuries and even thousands of years seemed recorded in its dim and greenish surface of unplaceable stone .
the figure , which was finally passed slowly from man to man for close and careful study , was between seven and eight inches in height , and of exquisitely artistic workmanship .
it represented a monster of vaguely anthropoid outline , but with an head whose face was a mass of feelers , a scaly , body , prodigious claws on hind and fore feet , and long , narrow wings behind .
this thing , which seemed instinct with a fearsome and unnatural malignancy , was of a somewhat bloated corpulence , and squatted evilly on a rectangular block or pedestal covered with undecipherable characters .
the tips of the wings touched the back edge of the block , the seat occupied the centre , whilst the long , curved claws of the , crouching hind legs gripped the front edge and extended a quarter of the way down toward the bottom of the pedestal .
the cephalopod head was bent forward , so that the ends of the facial feelers brushed the backs of huge fore paws which clasped the croucher elevated knees .
the aspect of the whole was abnormally , and the more subtly fearful because its source was so totally unknown .
its vast , awesome , and incalculable age was unmistakable ; yet not one link did it shew with any known type of art belonging to civilisation youth or indeed to any other time .
totally separate and apart , its very material was a mystery ; for the soapy , stone with its golden or iridescent flecks and striations resembled nothing familiar to geology or mineralogy .
the characters along the base were equally baffling ; and no member present , despite a representation of half the world expert learning in this field , could form the least notion of even their remotest linguistic kinship .
they , like the subject and material , belonged to something horribly remote and distinct from mankind as we know it , something frightfully suggestive of old and unhallowed cycles of life in which our world and our conceptions have no part .
and yet , as the members severally shook their heads and confessed defeat at the inspector problem , there was one man in that gathering who suspected a touch of bizarre familiarity in the monstrous shape and writing , and who presently told with some diffidence of the odd trifle he knew .
this person was the late william channing webb , professor of anthropology in princeton university , and an explorer of no slight note .
professor webb had been engaged , years before , in a tour of greenland and iceland in search of some runic inscriptions which he failed to unearth ; and whilst high up on the west greenland coast had encountered a singular tribe or cult of degenerate esquimaux whose religion , a curious form of , chilled him with its deliberate bloodthirstiness and repulsiveness .
it was a faith of which other esquimaux knew little , and which they mentioned only with shudders , saying that it had come down from horribly ancient aeons before ever the world was made .
besides nameless rites and human sacrifices there were certain queer hereditary rituals addressed to a supreme elder devil or tornasuk ; and of this professor webb had taken a careful phonetic copy from an aged angekok or , expressing the sounds in roman letters as best he knew how .
but just now of prime significance was the fetish which this cult had cherished , and around which they danced when the aurora leaped high over the ice cliffs .
it was , the professor stated , a very crude of stone , comprising a hideous picture and some cryptic writing .
and so far as he could tell , it was a rough parallel in all essential features of the bestial thing now lying before the meeting .
this data , received with suspense and astonishment by the assembled members , proved doubly exciting to inspector legrasse ; and he began at once to ply his informant with questions .
having noted and copied an oral ritual among the swamp his men had arrested , he besought the professor to remember as best he might the syllables taken down amongst the diabolist esquimaux .
there then followed an exhaustive comparison of details , and a moment of really awed silence when both detective and scientist agreed on the virtual identity of the phrase common to two hellish rituals so many worlds of distance apart .
what , in substance , both the esquimaux wizards and the louisiana had chanted to their kindred idols was something very like this the being guessed at from traditional breaks in the phrase as chanted aloud cthulhu fhtagn .
legrasse had one point in advance of professor webb , for several among his mongrel prisoners had repeated to him what older celebrants had told them the words meant .
this text , as given , ran something like this in his house at dead cthulhu waits dreaming .
and now , in response to a general and urgent demand , inspector legrasse related as fully as possible his experience with the swamp worshippers ; telling a story to which i could see my uncle attached profound significance .
it savoured of the wildest dreams of and theosophist , and disclosed an astonishing degree of cosmic imagination among such and pariahs as might be least expected to possess it .
on november , , there had come to the new orleans police a frantic summons from the swamp and lagoon country to the south .
the squatters there , mostly primitive but descendants of lafitte men , were in the grip of stark terror from an unknown thing which had stolen upon them in the night .
it was voodoo , apparently , but voodoo of a more terrible sort than they had ever known ; and some of their women and children had disappeared since the malevolent had begun its incessant beating far within the black haunted woods where no dweller ventured .
there were insane shouts and harrowing screams , chants and dancing ; and , the frightened messenger added , the people could stand it no more .
so a body of twenty police , filling two carriages and an automobile , had set out in the late afternoon with the shivering squatter as a guide .
at the end of the passable road they alighted , and for miles splashed on in silence through the terrible cypress woods where day never came .
ugly roots and malignant hanging nooses of spanish moss beset them , and now and then a pile of dank stones or fragment of a rotting wall intensified by its hint of morbid habitation a depression which every malformed tree and every fungous islet combined to create .
at length the squatter settlement , a miserable huddle of huts , hove in sight ; and hysterical dwellers ran out to cluster around the group of bobbing lanterns .
the muffled beat of was now faintly audible far , far ahead ; and a curdling shriek came at infrequent intervals when the wind shifted .
a reddish glare , too , seemed to filter through pale undergrowth beyond the endless avenues of forest night .
reluctant even to be left alone again , each one of the cowed squatters refused to advance another inch toward the scene of unholy worship , so inspector legrasse and his nineteen colleagues plunged on unguided into black arcades of horror that none of them had ever trod before .
the region now entered by the police was one of traditionally evil repute , substantially unknown and untraversed by white men .
there were legends of a hidden lake unglimpsed by mortal sight , in which dwelt a huge , formless white polypous thing with luminous eyes ; and squatters whispered that devils flew up out of caverns in inner earth to worship it at midnight .
they said it had been there before , before la salle , before the indians , and before even the wholesome beasts and birds of the woods .
it was nightmare itself , and to see it was to die .
but it made men dream , and so they knew enough to keep away .
the present voodoo orgy was , indeed , on the merest fringe of this abhorred area , but that location was bad enough ; hence perhaps the very place of the worship had terrified the squatters more than the shocking sounds and incidents .
only poetry or madness could do justice to the noises heard by legrasse men as they ploughed on through the black morass toward the red glare and muffled .
there are vocal qualities peculiar to men , and vocal qualities peculiar to beasts ; and it is terrible to hear the one when the source should yield the other .
animal fury and orgiastic license here whipped themselves to daemoniac heights by howls and squawking ecstacies that tore and reverberated through those nighted woods like pestilential tempests from the gulfs of hell .
now and then the less organized ululation would cease , and from what seemed a chorus of hoarse voices would rise in chant that hideous phrase or ritual cthulhu fhtagn .
then the men , having reached a spot where the trees were thinner , came suddenly in sight of the spectacle itself .
four of them reeled , one fainted , and two were shaken into a frantic cry which the mad cacophony of the orgy fortunately deadened .
legrasse dashed swamp water on the face of the fainting man , and all stood trembling and nearly hypnotised with horror .
in a natural glade of the swamp stood a grassy island of perhaps an acre extent , clear of trees and tolerably dry .
on this now leaped and twisted a more indescribable horde of human abnormality than any but a sime or an angarola could paint .
void of clothing , this hybrid spawn were braying , bellowing , and writhing about a monstrous bonfire ; in the centre of which , revealed by occasional rifts in the curtain of flame , stood a great granite monolith some eight feet in height ; on top of which , incongruous in its diminutiveness , rested the noxious carven statuette .
from a wide circle of ten scaffolds set up at regular intervals with the monolith as a centre hung , head downward , the oddly marred bodies of the helpless squatters who had disappeared .
it was inside this circle that the ring of worshippers jumped and roared , the general direction of the mass motion being from left to right in endless bacchanal between the ring of bodies and the ring of fire .
it may have been only imagination and it may have been only echoes which induced one of the men , an excitable spaniard , to fancy he heard antiphonal responses to the ritual from some far and unillumined spot deeper within the wood of ancient legendry and horror .
this man , joseph galvez , i later met and questioned ; and he proved distractingly imaginative .
he indeed went so far as to hint of the faint beating of great wings , and of a glimpse of shining eyes and a mountainous white bulk beyond the remotest trees but i suppose he had been hearing too much native superstition .
actually , the horrified pause of the men was of comparatively brief duration .
duty came first ; and although there must have been nearly a hundred mongrel celebrants in the throng , the police relied on their firearms and plunged determinedly into the nauseous rout .
for five minutes the resultant din and chaos were beyond description .
wild blows were struck , shots were fired , and escapes were made ; but in the end legrasse was able to count some sullen prisoners , whom he forced to dress in haste and fall into line between two rows of policemen .
five of the worshippers lay dead , and two severely wounded ones were carried away on improvised stretchers by their .
the image on the monolith , of course , was carefully removed and carried back by legrasse .
examined at headquarters after a trip of intense strain and weariness , the prisoners all proved to be men of a very low , , and mentally aberrant type .
most were seamen , and a sprinkling of negroes and mulattoes , largely west indians or brava portuguese from the cape verde islands , gave a colouring of voodooism to the heterogeneous cult .
but before many questions were asked , it became manifest that something far deeper and older than negro fetishism was involved .
degraded and ignorant as they were , the creatures held with surprising consistency to the central idea of their loathsome faith .
they worshipped , so they said , the great old ones who lived ages before there were any men , and who came to the young world out of the sky .
those old ones were gone now , inside the earth and under the sea ; but their dead bodies had told their secrets in dreams to the first men , who formed a cult which had never died .
this was that cult , and the prisoners said it had always existed and always would exist , hidden in distant wastes and dark places all over the world until the time when the great priest cthulhu , from his dark house in the mighty city of under the waters , should rise and bring the earth again beneath his sway .
some day he would call , when the stars were ready , and the secret cult would always be waiting to liberate him .
meanwhile no more must be told .
there was a secret which even torture could not extract .
mankind was not absolutely alone among the conscious things of earth , for shapes came out of the dark to visit the faithful few .
but these were not the great old ones .
no man had ever seen the old ones .
the carven idol was great cthulhu , but none might say whether or not the others were precisely like him .
no one could read the old writing now , but things were told by word of mouth .
the chanted ritual was not the secret that was never spoken aloud , only whispered .
the chant meant only this in his house at dead cthulhu waits dreaming .
only two of the prisoners were found sane enough to be hanged , and the rest were committed to various institutions .
all denied a part in the ritual murders , and averred that the killing had been done by black winged ones which had come to them from their immemorial in the haunted wood .
but of those mysterious allies no coherent account could ever be gained .
what the police did extract , came mainly from the immensely aged mestizo named castro , who claimed to have sailed to strange ports and talked with undying leaders of the cult in the mountains of china .
old castro remembered bits of hideous legend that paled the speculations of theosophists and made man and the world seem recent and transient indeed .
there had been aeons when other things ruled on the earth , and they had had great cities .
remains of them , he said the deathless chinamen had told him , were still be found as cyclopean stones on islands in the pacific .
they all died vast epochs of time before men came , but there were arts which could revive them when the stars had come round again to the right positions in the cycle of eternity .
they had , indeed , come themselves from the stars , and brought their images with them .
these great old ones , castro continued , were not composed altogether of flesh and blood .
they had shape for did not this image prove it ? but that shape was not made of matter .
when the stars were right , they could plunge from world to world through the sky ; but when the stars were wrong , they could not live .
but although they no longer lived , they would never really die .
they all lay in stone houses in their great city of , preserved by the spells of mighty cthulhu for a glorious resurrection when the stars and the earth might once more be ready for them .
but at that time some force from outside must serve to liberate their bodies .
the spells that preserved them intact likewise prevented them from making an initial move , and they could only lie awake in the dark and think whilst uncounted millions of years rolled by .
they knew all that was occurring in the universe , for their mode of speech was transmitted thought .
even now they talked in their tombs .
when , after infinities of chaos , the first men came , the great old ones spoke to the sensitive among them by moulding their dreams ; for only thus could their language reach the fleshly minds of mammals .
then , whispered castro , those first men formed the cult around tall idols which the great ones showed them ; idols brought in dim eras from dark stars .
that cult would never die till the stars came right again , and the secret priests would take great cthulhu from his tomb to revive his subjects and resume his rule of earth .
the time would be easy to know , for then mankind would have become as the great old ones ; free and wild and beyond good and evil , with laws and morals thrown aside and all men shouting and killing and revelling in joy .
then the liberated old ones would teach them new ways to shout and kill and revel and enjoy themselves , and all the earth would flame with a holocaust of ecstasy and freedom .
meanwhile the cult , by appropriate rites , must keep alive the memory of those ancient ways and shadow forth the prophecy of their return .
in the elder time chosen men had talked with the entombed old ones in dreams , but then something happened .
the great stone city , with its monoliths and sepulchres , had sunk beneath the waves ; and the deep waters , full of the one primal mystery through which not even thought can pass , had cut off the spectral intercourse .
but memory never died , and the said that the city would rise again when the stars were right .
then came out of the earth the black spirits of earth , mouldy and shadowy , and full of dim rumours picked up in caverns beneath forgotten .
but of them old castro dared not speak much .
he cut himself off hurriedly , and no amount of persuasion or subtlety could elicit more in this direction .
the size of the old ones , too , he curiously declined to mention .
of the cult , he said that he thought the centre lay amid the pathless desert of arabia , where irem , the city of pillars , dreams hidden and untouched .
it was not allied to the european , and was virtually unknown beyond its members .
no book had ever really hinted of it , though the deathless chinamen said that there were double meanings in the necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred which the initiated might read as they chose , especially the couplet that is not dead which can eternal lie , and with strange aeons even death may die .
legrasse , deeply impressed and not a little bewildered , had inquired in vain concerning the historic affiliations of the cult .
castro , apparently , had told the truth when he said that it was wholly secret .
the authorities at tulane university could shed no light upon either cult or image , and now the detective had come to the highest authorities in the country and met with no more than the greenland tale of professor webb .
the feverish interest aroused at the meeting by legrasse tale , corroborated as it was by the statuette , is echoed in the subsequent correspondence of those who attended ; although scant mention occurs in the formal publications of the society .
caution is the first care of those accustomed to face occasional charlatanry and imposture .
legrasse for some time lent the image to professor webb , but at the latter death it was returned to him and remains in his possession , where i viewed it not long ago .
it is truly a terrible thing , and unmistakably akin to the of young wilcox .
that my uncle was excited by the tale of the sculptor i did not wonder , for what thoughts must arise upon hearing , after a knowledge of what legrasse had learned of the cult , of a sensitive young man who had dreamed not only the figure and exact hieroglyphics of the image and the greenland devil tablet , but had come in his dreams upon at least three of the precise words of the formula uttered alike by esquimaux diabolists and mongrel louisianans ?
professor angell instant start on an investigation of the utmost thoroughness was eminently natural ; though privately i suspected young wilcox of having heard of the cult in some indirect way , and of having invented a series of dreams to heighten and continue the mystery at my uncle expense .
the and cuttings collected by the professor were , of course , strong corroboration ; but the rationalism of my mind and the extravagance of the whole subject led me to adopt what i thought the most sensible conclusions .
so , after thoroughly studying the manuscript again and correlating the theosophical and anthropological notes with the cult narrative of legrasse , i made a trip to providence to see the sculptor and give him the rebuke i thought proper for so boldly imposing upon a learned and aged man .
wilcox still lived alone in the building in thomas street , a hideous victorian imitation of seventeenth century breton architecture which flaunts its stuccoed front amidst the lovely colonial houses on the ancient hill , and under the very shadow of the finest georgian steeple in america , i found him at work in his rooms , and at once conceded from the specimens scattered about that his genius is indeed profound and authentic .
he will , i believe , some time be heard from as one of the great decadents ; for he has crystallised in clay and will one day mirror in marble those nightmares and phantasies which arthur machen evokes in prose , and clark ashton smith makes visible in verse and in painting .
dark , frail , and somewhat unkempt in aspect , he turned languidly at my knock and asked me my business without rising .
then i told him who i was , he displayed some interest ; for my uncle had excited his curiosity in probing his strange dreams , yet had never explained the reason for the study .
i did not enlarge his knowledge in this regard , but sought with some subtlety to draw him out .
in a short time i became convinced of his absolute sincerity , for he spoke of the dreams in a manner none could mistake .
they and their subconscious residuum had influenced his art profoundly , and he shewed me a morbid statue whose contours almost made me shake with the potency of its black suggestion .
he could not recall having seen the original of this thing except in his own dream , but the outlines had formed themselves insensibly under his hands .
it was , no doubt , the giant shape he had raved of in delirium .
that he really knew nothing of the hidden cult , save from what my uncle relentless catechism had let fall , he soon made clear ; and again i strove to think of some way in which he could possibly have received the weird impressions .
he talked of his dreams in a strangely poetic fashion ; making me see with terrible vividness the damp cyclopean city of slimy green stone whose geometry , he oddly said , was all wrong and hear with frightened expectancy the ceaseless , calling from underground cthulhu fhtagn , cthulhu fhtagn .
these words had formed part of that dread ritual which told of dead cthulhu in his stone vault at , and i felt deeply moved despite my rational beliefs .
wilcox , i was sure , had heard of the cult in some casual way , and had soon forgotten it amidst the mass of his equally weird reading and imagining .
later , by virtue of its sheer impressiveness , it had found subconscious expression in dreams , in the , and in the terrible statue i now beheld ; so that his imposture upon my uncle had been a very innocent one .
the youth was of a type , at once slightly affected and slightly , which i could never like , but i was willing enough now to admit both his genius and his honesty .
i took leave of him amicably , and wish him all the success his talent promises .
the matter of the cult still remained to fascinate me , and at times i had visions of personal fame from researches into its origin and connections .
i visited new orleans , talked with legrasse and others of that , saw the frightful image , and even questioned such of the mongrel prisoners as still survived .
old castro , unfortunately , had been dead for some years .
what i now heard so graphically at , though it was really no more than a detailed confirmation of what my uncle had written , excited me afresh ; for i felt sure that i was on the track of a very real , very secret , and very ancient religion whose discovery would make me an anthropologist of note .
my attitude was still one of absolute materialism , as i wish it still were , and i discounted with almost inexplicable perversity the coincidence of the dream notes and odd cuttings collected by professor angell .
one thing i began to suspect , and which i now fear i know , is that my uncle death was far from natural .
he fell on a narrow hill street leading up from an ancient waterfront swarming with foreign mongrels , after a careless push from a negro sailor .
i did not forget the mixed blood and marine pursuits of the in louisiana , and would not be surprised to learn of secret methods and rites and beliefs .
legrasse and his men , it is true , have been let alone ; but in norway a certain seaman who saw things is dead .
might not the deeper inquiries of my uncle after encountering the sculptor data have come to sinister ears ?
i think professor angell died because he knew too much , or because he was likely to learn too much .
whether i shall go as he did remains to be seen , for i have learned much now .
.
the madness from the sea if heaven ever wishes to grant me a boon , it will be a total effacing of the results of a mere chance which fixed my eye on a certain stray piece of .
it was nothing on which i would naturally have stumbled in the course of my daily round , for it was an old number of an australian journal , the sydney bulletin for april , .
it had escaped even the cutting bureau which had at the time of its issuance been avidly collecting material for my uncle research .
i had largely given over my inquiries into what professor angell called the cthulhu cult , and was visiting a learned friend in paterson , new jersey ; the curator of a local museum and a mineralogist of note .
examining one day the reserve specimens roughly set on the storage shelves in a rear room of the museum , my eye was caught by an odd picture in one of the old papers spread beneath the stones .
it was the sydney bulletin i have mentioned , for my friend had wide affiliations in all conceivable foreign parts ; and the picture was a cut of a hideous stone image almost identical with that which legrasse had found in the swamp .
eagerly clearing the sheet of its precious contents , i scanned the item in detail ; and was disappointed to find it of only moderate length .
what it suggested , however , was of portentous significance to my flagging quest ; and i carefully tore it out for immediate action .
it read as follows vigilant arrives with helpless armed new zealand yacht in tow .
one survivor and dead man found aboard .
tale of desperate battle and deaths at sea .
rescued seaman refuses particulars of strange experience .
odd idol found in his possession .
inquiry to follow .
the morrison freighter vigilant , bound from valparaiso , arrived this morning at its wharf in darling harbour , having in tow the battled and disabled but heavily armed steam yacht alert of dunedin , , which was sighted april in latitude ' , longitude ' , with one living and one dead man aboard .
the vigilant left valparaiso march , and on april was driven considerably south of her course by exceptionally heavy storms and monster waves .
on april the derelict was sighted ; and though apparently deserted , was found upon boarding to contain one survivor in a condition and one man who had evidently been dead for more than a week .
the living man was clutching a horrible stone idol of unknown origin , about foot in height , regarding whose nature authorities at sydney university , the royal society , and the museum in college street all profess complete bafflement , and which the survivor says he found in the cabin of the yacht , in a small carved shrine of common pattern .
this man , after recovering his senses , told an exceedingly strange story of piracy and slaughter .
he is gustaf johansen , a norwegian of some intelligence , and had been second mate of the schooner emma of auckland , which sailed for callao february with a complement of eleven men .
the emma , he says , was delayed and thrown widely south of her course by the great storm of march , and on march , in latitude ' longitude ' , encountered the alert , manned by a queer and crew of kanakas and .
being ordered peremptorily to turn back , capt .
collins refused ; whereupon the strange crew began to fire savagely and without warning upon the schooner with a peculiarly heavy battery of brass cannon forming part of the yacht equipment .
the emma men showed fight , says the survivor , and though the schooner began to sink from shots beneath the they managed to heave alongside their enemy and board her , grappling with the savage crew on the yacht deck , and being forced to kill them all , the number being slightly superior , because of their particularly abhorrent and desperate though rather clumsy mode of fighting .
three of the emma men , including capt .
collins and first mate green , were killed ; and the remaining eight under second mate johansen proceeded to navigate the captured yacht , going ahead in their original direction to see if any reason for their ordering back had existed .
the next day , it appears , they raised and landed on a small island , although none is known to exist in that part of the ocean ; and six of the men somehow died ashore , though johansen is queerly reticent about this part of his story , and speaks only of their falling into a rock chasm .
later , it seems , he and one companion boarded the yacht and tried to manage her , but were beaten about by the storm of april , from that time till his rescue on the the man remembers little , and he does not even recall when william briden , his companion , died .
briden death reveals no apparent cause , and was probably due to excitement or exposure .
cable advices from dunedin report that the alert was well known there as an island trader , and bore an evil reputation along the waterfront , it was owned by a curious group of whose frequent meetings and night trips to the woods attracted no little curiosity ; and it had set sail in great haste just after the storm and earth tremors of march .
our auckland correspondent gives the emma and her crew an excellent reputation , and johansen is described as a sober and worthy man .
the admiralty will institute an inquiry on the whole matter beginning tomorrow , at which every effort will be made to induce johansen to speak more freely than he has done hitherto .
this was all , together with the picture of the hellish image ; but what a train of ideas it started in my mind !
here were new treasuries of data on the cthulhu cult , and evidence that it had strange interests at sea as well as on land .
what motive prompted the hybrid crew to order back the emma as they sailed about with their hideous idol ?
what was the unknown island on which six of the emma crew had died , and about which the mate johansen was so secretive ?
what had the investigation brought out , and what was known of the noxious cult in dunedin ?
and most marvellous of all , what deep and more than natural linkage of dates was this which gave a malign and now undeniable significance to the various turns of events so carefully noted by my uncle ?
march or february according to the international date line the earthquake and storm had come .
from dunedin the alert and her noisome crew had darted eagerly forth as if imperiously summoned , and on the other side of the earth poets and artists had begun to dream of a strange , dank cyclopean city whilst a young sculptor had moulded in his sleep the form of the dreaded cthulhu .
march the crew of the emma landed on an unknown island and left six men dead ; and on that date the dreams of sensitive men assumed a heightened vividness and darkened with dread of a giant monster malign pursuit , whilst an architect had gone mad and a sculptor had lapsed suddenly into delirium !
and what of this storm of april the date on which all dreams of the dank city ceased , and wilcox emerged unharmed from the bondage of strange fever ?
what of all this and of those hints of old castro about the sunken , old ones and their coming reign ; their faithful cult and their mastery of dreams ?
was i tottering on the brink of cosmic horrors beyond man power to bear ?
if so , they must be horrors of the mind alone , for in some way the second of april had put a stop to whatever monstrous menace had begun its siege of mankind soul .
that evening , after a day of hurried cabling and arranging , i bade my host adieu and took a train for san francisco .
in less than a month i was in dunedin ; where , however , i found that little was known of the strange who had lingered in the old .
waterfront scum was far too common for special mention ; though there was vague talk about one inland trip these mongrels had made , during which faint drumming and red flame were noted on the distant hills .
in auckland i learned that johansen had returned with yellow hair turned white after a perfunctory and inconclusive questioning at sydney , and had thereafter sold his cottage in west street and sailed with his wife to his old home in oslo .
of his stirring experience he would tell his friends no more than he had told the admiralty officials , and all they could do was to give me his oslo address .
after that i went to sydney and talked profitlessly with seamen and members of the court .
i saw the alert , now sold and in commercial use , at circular quay in sydney cove , but gained nothing from its bulk .
the crouching image with its cuttlefish head , dragon body , scaly wings , and hieroglyphed pedestal , was preserved in the museum at hyde park ; and i studied it long and well , finding it a thing of balefully exquisite workmanship , and with the same utter mystery , terrible antiquity , and unearthly strangeness of material which i had noted in legrasse smaller specimen .
geologists , the curator told me , had found it a monstrous puzzle ; for they vowed that the world held no rock like it .
then i thought with a shudder of what old castro had told legrasse about the old ones ; they had come from the stars , and had brought their images with them .
shaken with such a mental resolution as i had never before known , i now resolved to visit mate johansen in oslo .
sailing for london , i reembarked at once for the norwegian capital ; and one autumn day landed at the trim wharves in the shadow of the egeberg .
johansen address , i discovered , lay in the old town of king harold haardrada , which kept alive the name of oslo during all the centuries that the greater city masqueraded as christiana .
i made the brief trip by taxicab , and knocked with palpitant heart at the door of a neat and ancient building with plastered front .
a woman in black answered my summons , and i was stung with disappointment when she told me in halting english that gustaf johansen was no more .
he had not long survived his return , said his wife , for the doings at sea in had broken him .
he had told her no more than he told the public , but had left a long manuscript of technical matters as he said written in english , evidently in order to guard her from the peril of casual perusal .
during a walk through a narrow lane near the gothenburg dock , a bundle of papers falling from an attic window had knocked him down .
two lascar sailors at once helped him to his feet , but before the ambulance could reach him he was dead .
physicians found no adequate cause the end , and laid it to heart trouble and a weakened constitution .
i now felt gnawing at my vitals that dark terror which will never leave me till i , too , am at rest ; accidentally or otherwise .
persuading the widow that my connection with her husband technical matters was sufficient to entitle me to his manuscript , i bore the document away and began to read it on the london boat .
it was a simple , rambling thing a naive sailor effort at a diary and strove to recall day by day that last awful voyage .
i can not attempt to transcribe it verbatim in all its cloudiness and redundance , but i will tell its gist enough to show why the sound the water against the vessel sides became so unendurable to me that i stopped my ears with cotton .
johansen , thank god , did not know quite all , even though he saw the city and the thing , but i shall never sleep calmly again when i think of the horrors that lurk ceaselessly behind life in time and in space , and of those unhallowed blasphemies from elder stars which dream beneath the sea , known and favoured by a nightmare cult ready and eager to loose them upon the world whenever another earthquake shall heave their monstrous stone city again to the sun and air .
johansen voyage had begun just as he told it to the .
the emma , in ballast , had cleared auckland on february , and had felt the full force of that tempest which must have heaved up from the the horrors that filled men dreams .
once more under control , the ship was making good progress when held up by the alert on march , and i could feel the mate regret as he wrote of her bombardment and sinking .
of the swarthy on the alert he speaks with significant horror .
there was some peculiarly abominable quality about them which made their destruction seem almost a duty , and johansen shows ingenuous wonder at the charge of ruthlessness brought against his party during the proceedings of the court of inquiry .
then , driven ahead by curiosity in their captured yacht under johansen command , the men sight a great stone pillar sticking out of the sea , and in latitude ' , longitude ' , come upon a coastline of mingled mud , ooze , and weedy cyclopean masonry which can be nothing less than the tangible substance of earth supreme terror the nightmare of , that was built in measureless aeons behind history by the vast , loathsome shapes that seeped down from the dark stars .
there lay great cthulhu and his hordes , hidden in green slimy vaults and sending out at last , after cycles incalculable , the thoughts that spread fear to the dreams of the sensitive and called imperiously to the faithful to come on a pilgrimage of liberation and restoration .
all this johansen did not suspect , but god knows he soon saw enough !
i suppose that only a single , the hideous citadel whereon great cthulhu was buried , actually emerged from the waters .
when i think of the extent of all that may be brooding down there i almost wish to kill myself forthwith .
johansen and his men were awed by the cosmic majesty of this dripping babylon of elder daemons , and must have guessed without guidance that it was nothing of this or of any sane planet .
awe at the unbelievable size of the greenish stone blocks , at the dizzying height of the great carven monolith , and at the stupefying identity of the colossal statues and with the queer image found in the shrine on the alert , is poignantly visible in every line of the mates frightened description .
without knowing what futurism is like , johansen achieved something very close to it when he spoke of the city ; for instead of describing any definite structure or building , he dwells only on broad impressions of vast angles and stone surfaces surfaces too great to belong to anything right or proper for this earth , and impious with horrible images and hieroglyphs .
i mention his talk about angles because it suggests something wilcox had told me of his awful dreams .
he said that the geometry of the he saw was abnormal , , and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours .
now an unlettered seaman felt the same thing whilst gazing at the terrible reality .
johansen and his men landed at a sloping on this monstrous acropolis , and clambered slipperily up over titan oozy blocks which could have been no mortal staircase .
the very sun of heaven seemed distorted when viewed through the polarising miasma welling out from this perversion , and twisted menace and suspense lurked leeringly in those crazily elusive angles of carven rock where a second glance showed concavity after the first showed convexity .
something very like fright had come over all the explorers before anything more definite than rock and ooze and weed was seen .
each would have fled had he not feared the scorn of the others , and it was only that they searched vainly , as it proved for some portable souvenir to bear away .
it was rodriguez the portuguese who climbed up the foot of the monolith and shouted of what he had found .
the rest followed him , and looked curiously at the immense carved door with the now familiar .
it was , johansen said , like a great ; and they all felt that it was a door because of the ornate lintel , threshold , and jambs around it , though they could not decide whether it lay flat like a or slantwise like an outside .
as wilcox would have said , the geometry of the place was all wrong .
one could not be sure that the sea and the ground were horizontal , hence the relative position of everything else seemed phantasmally variable .
briden pushed at the stone in several places without result .
then donovan felt over it delicately around the edge , pressing each point separately as he went .
he climbed interminably along the grotesque stone moulding that is , one would call it climbing if the thing was not after all horizontal and the men wondered how any door in the universe could be so vast .
then , very softly and slowly , the lintel began to give inward at the top ; and they saw that it was balanced .
donovan slid or somehow propelled himself down or along the jamb and rejoined his fellows , and everyone watched the queer recession of the monstrously carven portal .
in this phantasy of prismatic distortion it moved anomalously in a diagonal way , so that all the rules of matter and perspective seemed upset .
the aperture was black with a darkness almost material .
that tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality ; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed , and actually burst forth like smoke from its imprisonment , visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings .
the odour rising from the newly opened depths was intolerable , and at length the hawkins thought he heard a nasty , slopping sound down there .
everyone listened , and everyone was listening still when it lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness .
poor johansen handwriting almost gave out when he wrote of this .
of the six men who never reached the ship , he thinks two perished of pure fright in that accursed instant .
the thing can not be described there is no language for such abysms of shrieking and immemorial lunacy , such eldritch contradictions of all matter , force , and cosmic order .
a mountain walked or stumbled .
god !
what wonder that across the earth a great architect went mad , and poor wilcox raved with fever in that telepathic instant ?
the thing of the idols , the green , sticky spawn of the stars , had awaked to claim his own .
the stars were right again , and what an cult had failed to do by design , a band of innocent sailors had done by accident .
after vigintillions of years great cthulhu was loose again , and ravening for delight .
three men were swept up by the flabby claws before anybody turned .
god rest them , if there be any rest in the universe .
they were donovan , guerrera , and angstrom .
parker slipped as the other three were plunging frenziedly over endless vistas of rock to the boat , and johansen swears he was swallowed up by an angle of masonry which should have been there ; an angle which was acute , but behaved as if it were obtuse .
so only briden and johansen reached the boat , and pulled desperately for the alert as the mountainous monstrosity flopped down the slimy stones and hesitated , floundering at the edge of the water .
steam had not been suffered to go down entirely , despite the departure of all hands for the shore ; and it was the work of only a few moments of feverish rushing up and down between wheel and engines to get the alert under way .
slowly , amidst the distorted horrors of that indescribable scene , she began to churn the lethal waters ; whilst on the masonry of that charnel shore that was not of earth the titan thing from the stars slavered and gibbered like polypheme cursing the fleeing ship of odysseus .
then , bolder than the storied cyclops , great cthulhu slid greasily into the water and began to pursue with vast strokes of cosmic potency .
briden looked back and went mad , laughing shrilly as he kept on laughing at intervals till death found him one night in the cabin whilst johansen was wandering deliriously .
but johansen had not given out yet .
knowing that the thing could surely overtake the alert until steam was fully up , he resolved on a desperate chance ; and , setting the engine for full speed , ran on deck and reversed the wheel .
there was a mighty eddying and foaming in the noisome brine , and as the steam mounted higher and higher the brave norwegian drove his vessel head on against the pursuing jelly which rose above the unclean froth like the stern of a daemon galleon .
the awful with writhing feelers came nearly up to the bowsprit of the sturdy yacht , but johansen drove on relentlessly .
there was a bursting as of an exploding bladder , a slushy nastiness as of a cloven sunfish , a stench as of a thousand opened graves , and a sound that the chronicler could not put on paper .
for an instant the ship was befouled by an acrid and blinding green cloud , and then there was only a venomous seething astern ; where god in heaven ! the scattered plasticity of that nameless was nebulously recombining in its hateful original form , whilst its distance widened every second as the alert gained impetus from its mounting steam .
that was all .
after that johansen only brooded over the idol in the cabin and attended to a few matters of food for himself and the laughing maniac by his side .
he did not try to navigate after the first bold flight , for the reaction had taken something out of his soul .
then came the storm of april , and a gathering of the clouds about his consciousness .
there is a sense of spectral whirling through liquid gulfs of infinity , of dizzying rides through reeling universes on a comets tail , and of hysterical plunges from the pit to the moon and from the moon back again to the pit , all livened by a cachinnating chorus of the distorted , hilarious elder gods and the green , mocking imps of tartarus .
out of that dream came rescue the vigilant , the court , the streets of dunedin , and the long voyage back home to the old house by the egeberg .
he could not tell they would think him mad .
he would write of what he knew before death came , but his wife must not guess .
death would be a boon if only it could blot out the memories .
that was the document i read , and now i have placed it in the tin box beside the and the papers of professor angell .
with it shall go this record of mine this test of my own sanity , wherein is pieced together that which i hope may never be pieced together again .
i have looked upon all that the universe has to hold of horror , and even the skies of spring and the flowers of summer must ever afterward be poison to me .
but i do not think my life will be long .
as my uncle went , as poor johansen went , so i shall go .
i know too much , and the cult still lives .
cthulhu still lives , too , i suppose , again in that chasm of stone which has shielded him since the sun was young .
his accursed city is sunken once more , for the vigilant sailed over the spot after the april storm ; but his ministers on earth still bellow and prance and slay around monoliths in lonely places .
he must have been trapped by the sinking whilst within his black abyss , or else the world would by now be screaming with fright and frenzy .
who knows the end ?
what has risen may sink , and what has sunk may rise .
loathsomeness waits and dreams in the deep , and decay spreads over the tottering cities of men .
a time will come but i must not and can not think !
let me pray that , if i do not survive this manuscript , my executors may put caution before audacity and see that it meets no other eye .
gorgons and hydras , and chimaeras dire stories of celaeno and the harpies may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition but they were there before .
they are transcripts , types the archetypes are in us , and eternal .
how else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us all ?
is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects , considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury ?
o , least of all !
these terrors are of older standing .
they date beyond body or without the body , they would have been the same that the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth , that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy are difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our condition , and a peep at least into the shadowland of .

when a traveller in north central massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of aylesbury pike just beyond dean corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country .
the ground gets higher , and the stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty , curving road .
the trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large , and the wild weeds , brambles and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions .
at the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren ; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age , squalor , and dilapidation .
without knowing why , one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping , meadows .
those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things , with which it would be better to have nothing to do .
when a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods , the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased .
the summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness , and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned .
gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way , and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety .
when the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes , and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous , creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping .
the thin , shining line of the miskatonic upper reaches has an oddly suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises .
as the hills draw nearer , one heeds their wooded sides more than their tops .
those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance , but there is no road by which to escape them .
across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of round mountain , and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region .
it is not reassuring to see , on a closer glance , that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin , and that the church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet .
one dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge , yet there is no way to avoid it .
once across , it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint , malign odour about the village street , as of the massed mould and decay of centuries .
it is always a relief to get clear of the place , and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the aylesbury pike .
afterwards one sometimes learns that one has been through dunwich .
outsiders visit dunwich as seldom as possible , and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing towards it have been taken down .
the scenery , judged by an ordinary aesthetic canon , is more than commonly beautiful ; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists .
two centuries ago , when talk of , , and strange forest presences was not laughed at , it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality .
in our sensible age since the dunwich horror of was hushed up by those who had the town and the world welfare at heart people shun it without knowing exactly why .
perhaps one reason though it can not apply to uninformed strangers is that the natives are now repellently decadent , having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many new england backwaters .
they have come to form a race by themselves , with the mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding .
the average of their intelligence is woefully low , whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of murders , incests , and deeds of almost unnameable violence and perversity .
the old gentry , representing the two or three armigerous families which came from salem in , have kept somewhat above the general level of decay ; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace .
some of the whateleys and bishops still send their eldest sons to harvard and miskatonic , though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born .
no one , even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror , can say just what is the matter with dunwich ; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the indians , amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills , and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below .
in the reverend abijah hoadley , newly come to the congregational church at dunwich village , preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of satan and his imps ; in which he said it must be allow , that these blasphemies of an infernall train of daemons are matters of too common knowledge to be deny ; the cursed voices of azazel and buzrael , of beelzebub and belial , being heard now from under ground by above a score of credible witnesses now living .
i myself did not more than a fortnight ago catch a very plain discourse of evill powers in the hill behind my house ; wherein there were a rattling and rolling , groaning , screeching , and hissing , such as no things of this earth could raise up , and which must needs have come from those caves that only black magick can discover , and only the divell unlock .
hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon , but the text , printed in springfield , is still extant .
noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year , and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers .
other traditions tell of foul odours near the circles of stone pillars , and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines ; while still others try to explain the devil hop yard a bleak , blasted hillside where no tree , shrub , or will grow .
then , too , the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights .
it is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying , and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer struggling breath .
if they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body , they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter ; but if they fail , they subside gradually into a disappointed silence .
these tales , of course , are obsolete and ridiculous ; because they come down from very old times .
dunwich is indeed ridiculously old older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it .
south of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient bishop house , which was built before ; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls , built in , form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen .
industry did not flourish here , and the factory movement proved .
oldest of all are the great rings of stone columns on the hilltops , but these are more generally attributed to the indians than to the settlers .
deposits of skulls and bones , found within these circles and around the sizeable rock on sentinel hill , sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the of the pocumtucks ; even though many ethnologists , disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory , persist in believing the remains caucasian .
.
it was in the township of dunwich , in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling , that wilbur whateley was born at on sunday , the second of february , .
this date was recalled because it was candlemas , which people in dunwich curiously observe under another name ; and because the noises in the hills had sounded , and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently , throughout the night before .
less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent whateleys , a somewhat deformed , unattractive albino woman of , living with an aged and father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth .
lavinia whateley had no known husband , but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child ; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might and did speculate as widely as they chose .
on the contrary , she seemed strangely proud of the dark , infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and albinism , and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future .
lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things , for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of whateleys , and which were fast falling to pieces with age and wormholes .
she had never been to school , but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that old whateley had taught her .
the remote farmhouse had always been feared because of old whateley reputation for black magic , and the unexplained death by violence of mrs whateley when lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular .
isolated among strange influences , lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose and singular occupations ; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared .
there was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs ' barking on the night wilbur was born , but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming .
neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward , when old whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into dunwich village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at osborne general store .
there seemed to be a change in the old man an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event .
amidst it all he showed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter , and what he said of the child paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward .
' i du keer what folks think ef lavinny boy looked like his pa , he would look like nothin ' ye expeck .
ye need think the only folks is the folks hereabouts .
lavinny read some , an ' has seed some things the most o ' ye only tell abaout .
i her man is as good a husban ' as ye kin find this side of aylesbury ; an ' ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as i dew , ye would ast no better church weddin ' nor .
let me tell ye suthin some day yew folks hear a child o ' lavinny ' its father name on the top o ' sentinel hill ! '
the only person who saw wilbur during the first month of his life were old zechariah whateley , of the undecayed whateleys , and earl sawyer wife , mamie bishop .
mamie visit was frankly one of curiosity , and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations ; but zechariah came to lead a pair of alderney cows which old whateley had bought of his son curtis .
this marked the beginning of a course of on the part of small wilbur family which ended only in , when the dunwich horror came and went ; yet at no time did the ramshackle whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock .
there came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old , and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic , specimens .
evidently some blight or distemper , perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn , caused a heavy mortality amongst the whateley animals .
odd wounds or sores , having something of the aspect of incisions , seemed to afflict the visible cattle ; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey , unshaven old man and his slattemly , albino daughter .
in the spring after wilbur birth lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills , bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child .
public interest in the whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby , and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit .
wilbur growth was indeed phenomenal , for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age .
his motions and even his vocal sounds showed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant , and no one was really unprepared when , at seven months , he began to walk unassisted , with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove .
it was somewhat after this time on that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of sentinel hill where the old stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones .
considerable talk was started when silas bishop of the undecayed bishops mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked .
silas was rounding up a stray heifer , but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern .
they darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush , and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed .
afterwards he could not be sure about the boy , who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on .
wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire , the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm .
his contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of suggested the most valid of reasons .
the next january gossips were mildly interested in the fact that black brat ' had commenced to talk , and at the age of only eleven months .
his speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region , and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud .
the boy was not talkative , yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by dunwich and its denizens .
the strangeness did not reside in what he said , or even in the simple idioms he used ; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds .
his facial aspect , too , was remarkable for its maturity ; for though he shared his mother and grandfather chinlessness , his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large , dark , almost latin eyes to give him an air of and preternatural intelligence .
he was , however , exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy ; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips , , yellowish skin , coarse crinkly hair , and oddly elongated ears .
he was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire , and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of old whateley , and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him .
dogs abhorred the boy , and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace .
.
meanwhile old whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd .
he also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house a spacious , affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside , and whose three rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter .
there must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour ; and though he still babbled dementedly at times , his carpentry seemed to show the effects of sound calculation .
it had already begun as soon as wilbur was born , when one of the many tool sheds had been put suddenly in order , clapboarded , and fitted with a stout fresh lock .
now , in restoring the abandoned upper storey of the house , he was a no less thorough craftsman .
his mania showed itself only in his tight of all the windows in the reclaimed section though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all .
less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson a room which several callers saw , though no one was ever admitted to the upper storey .
this chamber he lined with tall , firm shelving , along which he began gradually to arrange , in apparently careful order , all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms .
' i made some use of , ' he would say as he tried to mend a torn page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove , the boy fitten to make better use of .
he orter hev as well so as he kin , for they goin ' to be all of his larnin ' . '
when wilbur was a year and seven months old in september of his size and accomplishments were almost alarming .
he had grown as large as a child of four , and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker .
he ran freely about the fields and hills , and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings .
at home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather books , while old whateley would instruct and catechize him through long , hushed afternoons .
by this time the restoration of the house was finished , and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door .
it was a window in the rear of the east gable end , close against the hill ; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground .
about the period of this work completion people noticed that the old , tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since wilbur birth , had been abandoned again .
the door swung listlessly open , and when earl sawyer once stepped within after a call on old whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered such a stench , he averred , as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the indian circles on the hills , and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth .
but then , the homes and sheds of dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness .
the following months were void of visible events , save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises .
on may eve of there were tremors which even the aylesbury people felt , whilst the following produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronized with bursts of flame witch whateleys ' ' from the summit of sentinel hill .
wilbur was growing up uncannily , so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year .
he read avidly by himself now ; but talked much less than formerly .
a settled taciturnity was absorbing him , and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face .
he would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon , and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror .
the aversion displayed towards him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark , and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety .
his occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians .
the few callers at the house would often find lavinia alone on the ground floor , while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the second storey .
she would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there , though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose tried the locked door leading to the stairway .
that pedlar told the store loungers at dunwich village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above .
the loungers reflected , thinking of the door and runway , and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared .
then they shuddered as they recalled tales of old whateley youth , and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods .
it had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young wilbur personally .
in the war came , and squire sawyer whateley , as chairman of the local draft board , had hard work finding a quota of young dunwich men fit even to be sent to development camp .
the government , alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence , sent several officers and medical experts to investigate ; conducting a survey which new england newspaper readers may still recall .
it was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the whateleys , and caused the boston globe and arkham advertiser to print flamboyant sunday stories of young wilbur precociousness , old whateley black magic , and the shelves of strange books , the sealed second storey of the ancient farmhouse , and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises .
wilbur was four and a half then , and looked like a lad of fifteen .
his lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down , and his voice had begun to break .
earl sawyer went out to the whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men , and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces .
it was , he said , exactly like a smell he had found in the toolshed abandoned when the house was finally repaired ; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circle on the mountains .
dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared , and grinned over the obvious mistakes .
they wondered , too , why the writers made so much of the fact that old whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date .
the whateleys had received their visitors with distaste , though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk .
.
for a decade the annals of the whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their may eve and orgies .
twice a year they would light fires on the top of sentinel hill , at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence ; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely .
in the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper storey even when all the family were downstairs , and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed .
there was talk of a complaint to the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals but nothing ever came of it , since dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world attention to themselves .
about , when wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind , voice , stature , and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity , a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house .
it was all inside the sealed upper part , and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor , leaving only one vast open void between the ground storey and the peaked roof .
they had torn down the great central chimney , too , and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin .
in the spring after this event old whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of cold spring glen to chirp under his window at night .
he seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance , and told the loungers at osborn that he thought his time had almost come .
whistle jest in tune with my breathin ' naow , ' he said , ' i guess they gittin ' ready to ketch my soul .
they know it ' aout , an ' du to miss it .
yew know , boys , arter i gone , whether they git me er not .
ef they dew , they keep up ' an ' laffin ' till break o ' day .
ef they du they kinder quiet daown like .
i expeck them an ' the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes . '
on lammas night , , dr houghton of aylesbury was hastily summoned by wilbur whateley , who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from osborn in the village .
he found old whateley in a very grave state , with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off .
the shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside , whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping , as of the waves on some level beach .
the doctor , though , was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside ; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man .
it was uncanny and unnatural too much , thought dr houghton , like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call .
towards one old whateley gained consciousness , and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson .
space , willy , more space soon .
yew grows an ' that grows faster .
it be ready to serve ye soon , boy .
open up the gates to with the long chant that ye find on page of the complete edition , an ' then put a match to the prison .
fire from airth ca burn it nohaow . '
he was obviously quite mad .
after a pause , during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off , he added another sentence or two .
it , willy , an ' mind the quantity ; but du let it grow too fast fer the place , fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to , it all over an ' no use .
only them from beyont kin make it multiply an ' work only them , the old uns as wants to come back ' but speech gave place to gasps again , and lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change .
it was the same for more than an hour , when the final throaty rattle came .
dr houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence .
lavinia sobbed , but wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly .
did git him , ' he muttered in his heavy bass voice .
wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his way , and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept .
he was more and more hated and dreaded around dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door ; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of gold which still , as in his grandfather time , went forth regularly and increasingly for .
he was now tremendously mature of aspect , and his height , having reached the normal adult limit , seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure .
in , when a scholarly correspondent from miskatonic university called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled , he was fully six and feet tall .
through all the years wilbur had treated his albino mother with a growing contempt , finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on may eve and hallowmass ; and in the poor creature complained to mamie bishop of being afraid of him .
more abaout him as i knows than i kin tell ye , mamie , ' she said , ' naowadays they more nor what i know myself .
i vaow afur gawd , i du know what he wants nor what he ' to dew . '
that the hill noises sounded louder than ever , and fire burned on sentinel hill as usual ; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted whateley farmhouse .
after midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside , and not until dawn did they finally quiet down .
then they vanished , hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue .
what this meant , no one could quite be certain till later .
none of the countryfolk seemed to have died but poor lavinia whateley , the twisted albino , was never seen again .
in the summer of wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them .
soon afterwards earl sawyer told the loungers at osborn that more carpentry was going on in the whateley farmhouse .
wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor , and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before .
he was living in one of the sheds , and sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous .
people generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother disappearance , and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now .
his height had increased to more than seven feet , and showed no signs of ceasing its development .
the following winter brought an event no less strange than wilbur first trip outside the dunwich region .
correspondence with the widener library at harvard , the bibliothèque nationale in paris , the british museum , the university of buenos ayres , and the library of miskatonic university at arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted ; so at length he set out in person , shabby , dirty , bearded , and uncouth of dialect , to consult the copy at miskatonic , which was the nearest to him geographically .
almost eight feet tall , and carrying a cheap new valise from osborne general store , this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library the hideous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred in olaus wormius ' latin version , as printed in spain in the seventeenth century .
he had never seen a city before , but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds ; where indeed , he passed heedlessly by the great watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity , and tugged frantically at its stout chain .
wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of dr dee english version which his grandfather had bequeathed him , and upon receiving access to the latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the page of his own defective volume .
this much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian the same erudite henry armitage ( miskatonic , princeton , .
johns hopkins ) who had once called at the farm , and who now politely plied him with questions .
he was looking , he had to admit , for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name , and it puzzled him to find discrepancies , duplications , and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy .
as he copied the formula he finally chose , dr armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages ; the one of which , in the latin version , contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world .
nor is it to be thought ( ran the text as armitage mentally translated it ) that man is either the oldest or the last of earth masters , or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone .
the old ones were , the old ones are , and the old ones shall be .
not in the spaces we know , but between them , they walk serene and primal , undimensioned and to us unseen .
knows the gate .
is the gate .
is the key and guardian of the gate .
past , present , future , all are one in .
he knows where the old ones broke through of old , and where they shall break through again .
he knows where they had trod earth fields , and where they still tread them , and why no one can behold them as they tread .
by their smell can men sometimes know them near , but of their semblance can no man know , saving only in the features of those they have begotten on mankind ; and of those are there many sorts , differing in likeness from man truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is them .
they walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the words have been spoken and the rites howled through at their seasons .
the wind gibbers with their voices , and the earth mutters with their consciousness .
they bend the forest and crush the city , yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites .
kadath in the cold waste hath known them , and what man knows kadath ?
the ice desert of the south and the sunken isles of ocean hold stones whereon their seal is engraver , but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles ?
great cthulhu is their cousin , yet can he spy them only dimly .
iä !
!
as a foulness shall ye know them .
their hand is at your throats , yet ye see them not ; and their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold .
is the key to the gate , whereby the spheres meet .
man rules now where they ruled once ; they shall soon rule where man rules now .
after summer is winter , after winter summer .
they wait patient and potent , for here shall they reign again .
armitage , associating what he was reading with what he had heard of dunwich and its brooding presences , and of wilbur whateley and his dim , hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide , felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb cold clamminess .
the bent , goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension ; like something only partly of mankind , and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter , space and time .
presently wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange , resonant fashion which hinted at organs unlike the run of mankind .
armitage , ' he said , ' i i got to take that book home .
they things in it i got to try under sarten conditions that i ca git here , en ' it be a mortal sin to let a rule hold me up .
let me take it along , sir , an ' i swar they wu nobody know the difference .
i du need to tell ye i take good keer of it .
it wa me that put this dee copy in the shape it is ' he stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian face , and his own goatish features grew crafty .
armitage , to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed , thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself .
there was too much responsibility in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres .
whateley saw how things stood , and tried to answer lightly .
, all right , ef ye feel that way abaout it .
maybe harvard wo be so fussy as yew be . '
and without saying more he rose and strode out of the building , stooping at each doorway .
armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog , and studied whateley lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window .
he thought of the wild tales he had heard , and recalled the old sunday stories in the advertiser ; these things , and the lore he had picked up from dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there .
unseen things not of earth or at least not of tridimensional earth rushed foetid and horrible through new england glens , and brooded obscenely on the mountain tops .
of this he had long felt certain .
now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror , and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare .
he locked away the necronomicon with a shudder of disgust , but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench .
a foulness shall ye know them , ' he quoted .
yes the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the whateley farmhouse less than three years before .
he thought of wilbur , goatish and ominous , once again , and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage .
? '
armitage muttered to himself .
god , what simpletons !
show them arthur machen great god pan and they think it a common dunwich scandal !
but what thing what cursed shapeless influence on or off this earth was wilbur whateley father ?
born on candlemas nine months after may eve of , when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to arkham what walked on the mountains that may night ?
what roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in flesh and blood ? '
during the ensuing weeks dr armitage set about to collect all possible data on wilbur whateley and the formless presences around dunwich .
he got in communication with dr houghton of aylesbury , who had attended old whateley in his last illness , and found much to ponder over in the grandfather last words as quoted by the physician .
a visit to dunwich village failed to bring out much that was new ; but a close survey of the necronomicon , in those parts which wilbur had sought so avidly , seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature , methods , and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet .
talks with several students of archaic lore in boston , and letters to many others elsewhere , gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear .
as the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper miskatonic valley , and about the monstrous being known to the human world as wilbur whateley .
.
the dunwich horror itself came between lammas and the equinox in , and dr armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue .
he had heard , meanwhile , of whateley grotesque trip to cambridge , and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the necronomicon at the widener library .
those efforts had been in vain , since armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume .
wilbur had been shockingly nervous at cambridge ; anxious for the book , yet almost equally anxious to get home again , as if he feared the results of being away long .
early in august the outcome developed , and in the small hours of the third dr armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild , fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus .
deep and terrible , the snarling , growls and barks continued ; always in mounting volume , but with hideously significant pauses .
then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat such a scream as roused half the sleepers of arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterwards such a scream as could come from no being born of earth , or wholly of earth .
armitage , hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings , saw that others were ahead of him ; and heard the echoes of a still shrilling from the library .
an open window showed black and gaping in the moonlight .
what had come had indeed completed its entrance ; for the barking and the screaming , now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning , proceeded unmistakably from within .
some instinct warned armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see , so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door .
among the others he saw professor warren rice and dr francis morgan , men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings ; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside .
the inward sounds , except for a watchful , droning whine from the dog , had by this time quite subsided ; but armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping , as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man .
the building was full of a frightful stench which dr armitage knew too well , and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical whence the low whining came .
for a second nobody dared to turn on the light , then armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch .
one of the three it is not certain which shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs .
professor rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant , though he did not stumble or fall .
the thing that lay on its side in a foetid pool of ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall , and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin .
it was not quite dead , but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside .
bits of and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room , and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown .
near the central desk a revolver had fallen , a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired .
the thing itself , however , crowded out all other images at the time .
it would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it , but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualized by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common of this planet and of the three known dimensions .
it was partly human , beyond a doubt , with very manlike hands and head , and the goatish , chinless face had the stamp of the whateley upon it .
but the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous , so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated .
above the waist it was ; though its chest , where the dog rending paws still rested watchfully , had the leathery , reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator .
the back was piebald with yellow and black , and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes .
below the waist , though , it was the worst ; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began .
the skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur , and from the abdomen a score of long tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply .
their arrangement was odd , and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system .
on each of the hips , deep set in a kind of pinkish , ciliated orbit , was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye ; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings , and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat .
the limbs , save for their black fur , roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth giant saurians , and terminated in pads that were neither hooves nor claws .
when the thing breathed , its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour , as if from some circulatory cause normal to the greenish tinge , whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly in the spaces between the purple rings .
of genuine blood there was none ; only the foetid ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness , and left a curious discoloration behind it .
as the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing , it began to mumble without turning or raising its head .
dr armitage made no written record of its mouthings , but asserts confidently that nothing in english was uttered .
at first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth , but towards the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the necronomicon , that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished .
these fragments , as armitage recalls them , ran something like , , , , ' they trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendos of unholy anticipation .
then came a halt in the gasping , and the dog raised its head in a long , lugubrious howl .
a change came over the yellow , goatish face of the prostrate thing , and the great black eyes fell in appallingly .
outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased , and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a whirring and fluttering .
against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight , frantic at that which they had sought for prey .
all at once the dog started up abruptly , gave a frightened bark , and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered .
a cry rose from the crowd , and dr armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came .
he was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in , and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one .
by this time two policemen had arrived ; and dr morgan , meeting them in the vestibule , was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up .
meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor .
one need not describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of dr armitage and professor rice ; but it is permissible to say that , aside from the external appearance of face and hands , the really human element in wilbur whateley must have been very small .
when the medical examiner came , there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards , and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared .
apparently whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton ; at least , in any true or stable sense .
he had taken somewhat after his unknown father .
.
yet all this was only the prologue of the actual dunwich horror .
formalities were gone through by bewildered officials , abnormal details were duly kept from press and public , and men were sent to dunwich and aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late wilbur whateley .
they found the countryside in great agitation , both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills , and because of the unwonted stench and the surging , lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by whateley farmhouse .
earl sawyer , who tended the horse and cattle during wilbur absence , had developed a woefully acute case of nerves .
the officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place ; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased living quarters , the newly mended sheds , to a single visit .
they filed a ponderous report at the courthouse in aylesbury , and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable whateleys , decayed and undecayed , of the upper miskatonic valley .
an almost interminable manuscript in strange characters , written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship , presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner desk .
after a week of debate it was sent to miskatonic university , together with the deceased collection of strange books , for study and possible translation ; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease .
no trace of the ancient gold with which wilbur and old whateley had always paid their debts has yet been discovered .
it was in the dark of september ninth that the horror broke loose .
the hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening , and dogs barked frantically all night .
early risers on the tenth noticed a peculiar stench in the air .
about seven luther brown , the hired boy at george corey , between cold spring glen and the village , rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to meadow with the cows .
he was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen ; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully , having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him .
between gasps luther tried to stammer out his tale to mrs corey .
thar in the rud beyont the glen , mis ' corey they suthin ' ben thar !
it smells like thunder , an ' all the bushes an ' little trees is pushed back from the rud like they a haouse ben moved along of it .
an ' that ai the wust , nuther .
they prints in the rud , mis ' corey great raound prints as big as , all sunk dawon deep like a elephant had ben along , only they a sight more nor four feet could make !
i looked at one or two afore i run , an ' i see every one was covered with lines spreadin ' aout from one place , like as if big fans twict or three times as big as any they is hed of ben paounded dawon into the rud .
an ' the smell was awful , like what it is around wizard whateley ol ' haouse ' here he faltered , and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home .
mrs corey , unable to extract more information , began telephoning the neighbours ; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors .
when she got sally sawyer , housekeeper at seth bishop , the nearest place to whateley , it became her turn to listen instead of transmit ; for sally boy chauncey , who slept poorly , had been up on the hill towards whateley , and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place , and at the pasturage where mr bishop cows had been left out all night .
, mis ' corey , ' came sally tremulous voice over the party wire , he just come back ' , and could half talk fer bein ' scairt !
he says ol ' whateley house is all bowed up , with timbers scattered raound like they ben dynamite inside ; only the bottom floor ai through , but is all covered with a kind o ' stuff that smells awful an ' drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun ' whar the side timbers is blowed away .
an ' they awful kinder marks in the yard , tew great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead , an ' all sticky with stuff like is on the haouse .
he says they leads off into the medders , whar a great swath a barn is matted daown , an ' all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes .
' he says , says he , mis ' corey , as haow he sot to look fer seth caows , frightened ez he was an ' faound in the upper pasture nigh the devil hop yard in an awful shape .
haff on clean gone , an ' nigh haff o ' them that left is sucked most dry o ' blood , with sores on like they ben on whateleys cattle ever senct lavinny black brat was born .
seth hes gone aout naow to look at , though i vaow he wo keer ter git very nigh wizard whateley !
did look keerful ter see whar the big swath led arter it leff the pasturage , but he says he thinks it towards the glen rud to the village .
' i tell ye , mis ' corey , they suthin ' abroad as had orter be abroad , an ' i for one think that black wilbur whateley , as come to the bad end he deserved , is at the bottom of the breedin ' of it .
he all human hisself , i allus says to everybody ; an ' i think he an ' ol ' whateley must a raised suthin ' in that there haouse as ai even so human as he was .
they allus ben unseen things araound dunwich livin ' things as ai human an ' ai good fer human folks .
graoun ' was ' las ' night , an ' towards mornin ' he heered the whippoorwills so laoud in col ' spring glen he could sleep nun .
then he thought he heered another saound over towards wizard whateley a kinder rippin ' or tearin ' o ' wood , like some big box er crate was bein ' opened fur off .
what with this an ' that , he did git to sleep at all till sunup , an ' no sooner was he up this mornin ' , but he got to go over to whateley an ' see what the matter .
he see enough i tell ye , mis ' corey !
this du mean no good , an ' i think as all the ought to git up a party an ' do suthin ' .
i know suthin ' awful abaout , an ' feel my time is nigh , though only gawd knows jest what it is .
your luther take accaount o ' whar them big tracks led tew ?
no ?
wal , mis ' corey , ef they was on the glen rud this side o ' the glen , an ' ai got to your haouse yet , i they must go into the glen itself .
they would do that .
i allus says col ' spring glen ai no healthy nor decent place .
the whippoorwills an ' fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o ' gawd , an ' they them as says ye kin hear strange things ' an ' ' in the air dawon thar ef ye stand in the right place , atween the rock falls an ' bear den . '
by that noon fully of the men and boys of dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the newmade whateley ruins and cold spring glen , examining in horror the vast , monstrous prints , the maimed bishop cattle , the strange , noisome wreck of the farmhouse , and the bruised , matted vegetation of the fields and roadside .
whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine ; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken , and a great avenue had been gouged in the underbrush .
it was as though a house , launched by an avalanche , had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope .
from below no sound came , but only a distant , undefinable foetor ; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue , rather than descend and beard the unknown cyclopean horror in its lair .
three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first , but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen .
someone telephoned the news to the aylesbury transcript ; but the editor , accustomed to wild tales from dunwich , did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it ; an item soon afterwards reproduced by the associated press .
that night everyone went home , and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible .
needless to say , no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage .
about two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at elmer frye , on the eastern edge of cold spring glen , and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside .
mrs frye proposed telephoning the neighbours , and elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations .
it came , apparently , from the barn ; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle .
the dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the family .
frye lit a lantern through force of habit , but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard .
the children and the whimpered , kept from screaming by some obscure , vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence .
at last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning , and a great snapping , crashing , and crackling ensued .
the fryes , huddled together in the , did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in cold spring glen .
then , amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of the late whippoorwills in the glen , selina frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror .
the next day all the countryside was in a panic ; and cowed , uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred .
two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the frye farmyard , monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground , and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in .
of the cattle , only a quarter could be found and identified .
some of these were in curious fragments , and all that survived had to be shot .
earl sawyer suggested that help be asked from aylesbury or arkham , but others maintained it would be of no use .
old zebulon whateley , of a branch that hovered about halfway between soundness and decadence , made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the .
he came of a line where tradition ran strong , and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with wilbur and his grandfather .
darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organize for real defence .
in a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof ; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before , and a futile , ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about .
nothing , however , occurred except some hill noises ; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come .
there were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen , though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority .
when night came again the barricading was repeated , though there was less huddling together of families .
in the morning both the frye and the seth bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar , while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting sentinel hill .
as before , the sides of the road showed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror ; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions , as if the moving mountain had come from cold spring glen and returned to it along the same path .
at the base of the hill a swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upwards , and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail .
whatever the horror was , it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality ; and as the investigators climbed round to the hill summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended or rather , reversed there .
it was here that the whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the stone on may eve and hallowmass .
now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror , whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped .
men looked at one another and muttered .
then they looked down the hill .
apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent .
to speculate was futile .
reason , logic , and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded .
only old zebulon , who was not with the group , could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation .
thursday night began much like the others , but it ended less happily .
the whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep , and about all the party telephones rang tremulously .
those who took down their receivers heard a voice shriek out , , oh , my gawd ! '
and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation .
there was nothing more .
no one dared do anything , and no one knew till morning whence the call came .
then those who had heard it called everyone on the line , and found that only the fryes did not reply .
the truth appeared an hour later , when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the frye place at the head of the glen .
it was horrible , yet hardly a surprise .
there were more swaths and monstrous prints , but there was no longer any house .
it had caved in like an , and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered .
only a stench and a tarry stickiness .
the elmer fryes had been erased from dunwich .
.
in the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a room in arkham .
the curious manuscript record or diary of wilbur whateley , delivered to miskatonic university for translation had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in language both ancient and modern ; its very alphabet , notwithstanding a general resemblance to the arabic used in mesopotamia , being absolutely unknown to any available authority .
the final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet , giving the effect of a cipher ; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue , even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used .
the ancient books taken from whateley quarters , while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science , were of no assistance whatever in this matter .
one of them , a heavy tome with an iron clasp , was in another unknown alphabet this one of a very different cast , and resembling sanskrit more than anything else .
the old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of dr armitage , both because of his peculiar interest in the whateley matter , and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the middle ages .
armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times , and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the saracenic world .
that question , however , he did not deem vital ; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if , as he suspected , they were used as a cipher in a modern language .
it was his belief that , considering the great amount of text involved , the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own , save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations .
accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in english .
dr armitage knew , from the repeated failures of his colleagues , that the riddle was a deep and complex one ; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial .
all through late august he fortified himself with the mass lore of cryptography ; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library , and wading night after night amidst the arcana of trithemius ' poligraphia , giambattista porta de furtivis literarum notis , de vigenere traite des chiffres , falconer cryptomenysis patefacta , davys ' and thicknesse treatises , and such fairly modern authorities as blair , van marten and kluber script itself , and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms , in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table , and the message built up with arbitrary known only to the initiated .
the older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones , and armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity , no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters .
several times he seemed near daylight , only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle .
then , as september approached , the clouds began to clear .
certain letters , as used in certain parts of the manuscript , emerged definitely and unmistakably ; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in english .
on the evening of september second the last major barrier gave way , and dr armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of wilbur whateley annals .
it was in truth a diary , as all had thought ; and it was couched in a style clearly showing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it .
almost the first long passage that armitage deciphered , an entry dated november , , proved highly startling and disquieting .
it was written , he remembered , by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen .
today learned the aklo for the sabaoth ( it ran ) , which did not like , it being answerable from the hill and not from the air .
that upstairs more ahead of me than i had thought it would be , and is not like to have much earth brain .
shot elam hutchins collie jack when he went to bite me , and elam says he would kill me if he dast .
i guess he wo .
grandfather kept me saying the dho formula last night , and i think i saw the inner city at the magnetic poles .
i shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off , if i ca break through with the formula when i commit it .
they from the air told me at sabbat that it will be years before i can clear off the earth , and i guess grandfather will be dead then , so i shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the yr and the nhhngr .
they from outside will help , but they can not take body without human blood .
that upstairs looks it will have the right cast .
i can see it a little when i make the voorish sign or blow the powder of ibn ghazi at it , and it is near like them at may eve on the hill .
the other face may wear off some .
i wonder how i shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it .
he that came with the aklo sabaoth said i may be transfigured there being much of outside to work on .
morning found dr armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration .
he had not left the manuscript all night , but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text .
he had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home , and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful .
all that day he read on , now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary .
lunch and dinner were brought him , but he ate only the smallest fraction of either .
toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair , but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man existence that he had uncovered .
on the morning of september fourth professor rice and dr morgan insisted on seeing him for a while , and departed trembling and .
that evening he went to bed , but slept only fitfully .
wednesday the next day he was back at the manuscript , and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered .
in the small hours of that night he slept a little in a easy chair in his office , but was at the manuscript again before dawn .
some time before noon his physician , dr hartwell , called to see him and insisted that he cease work .
he refused ; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary and promising an explanation in due course of time .
that evening , just as twilight fell , he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted .
his wife , bringing his dinner , found him in a state ; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken .
weakly rising , he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope , which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket .
he had sufficient strength to get home , but was so clearly in need of medical aid that dr hartwell was summoned at once .
as the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again , what , in god name , can we do ? '
dr armitage slept , but was partly delirious the next day .
he made no explanations to hartwell , but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with rice and morgan .
his wilder wanderings were very startling indeed , including frantic appeals that something in a farmhouse be destroyed , and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension .
he would shout that the world was in danger , since the elder things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen , vigintillions of aeons ago .
at other times he would call for the dreaded necronomicon and the daemonolatreia of remigius , in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up .
them , stop them ! '
he would shout .
whateleys meant to let them in , and the worst of all is left !
tell rice and morgan we must do something it a blind business , but i know how to make the powder it has been fed since the second of august , when wilbur came here to his death , and at that rate ' but armitage had a sound physique despite his years , and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever .
he woke late friday , clear of head , though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility .
saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon rice and morgan for a conference , and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate .
strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage ; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance .
of scepticism there was none .
all three had seen the body of wilbur whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building , and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman raving .
opinions were divided as to notifying the massachusetts state police , and the negative finally won .
there were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample , as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations .
late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan , but all day sunday armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory .
the more he reflected on the hellish diary , the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which wilbur whateley had left behind him the earth threatening entity which , unknown to him , was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable dunwich horror .
monday was a repetition of sunday with dr armitage , for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment .
further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan , and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain .
by tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out , and believed he would try a trip to dunwich within a week .
then , on wednesday , the great shock came .
tucked obscurely away in a corner of the arkham advertiser was a facetious little item from the associated press , telling what a monster the bootleg whisky of dunwich had raised up .
armitage , half stunned , could only telephone for rice and morgan .
far into the night they discussed , and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all .
armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers , yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him .
.
friday morning armitage , rice , and morgan set out by motor for dunwich , arriving at the village about one in the afternoon .
the day was pleasant , but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep , shadowy ravines of the stricken region .
now and then on some mountain top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky .
from the air of hushed fright at osborn store they knew something hideous had happened , and soon learned of the annihilation of the elmer frye house and family .
throughout that afternoon they rode around dunwich , questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred , and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness , the blasphemous tracks in the frye yard , the wounded seth bishop cattle , and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places .
the trail up and down sentinel hill seemed to armitage of almost cataclysmic significance , and he looked long at the sinister stone on the summit .
at length the visitors , apprised of a party of state police which had come from aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the frye tragedy , decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable .
this , however , they found more easily planned than performed ; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction .
there had been five of them in a car , but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the frye yard .
the natives , all of whom had talked with the policemen , seemed at first as perplexed as armitage and his companions .
then old sam hutchins thought of something and turned pale , nudging fred farr and pointing to the dank , deep hollow that yawned close by .
, ' he gasped , ' i telled not ter go daown into the glen , an ' i never thought nobody dew it with them tracks an ' that smell an ' the whippoorwills ' daown thar in the dark o ' noonday ' a cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike , and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive , unconscious listening .
armitage , now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work , trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his .
night would soon fall , and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course .
negotium perambuians in tenebris the old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorized , and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorized .
he saw that his electric flashlight was in working order .
rice , beside him , took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects ; whilst morgan uncased the rifle on which he relied despite his colleague warnings that no material weapon would be of help .
armitage , having read the hideous diary , knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect ; but he did not add to the fright of the dunwich people by giving any hints or clues .
he hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped .
as the shadows gathered , the natives commenced to disperse homeward , anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose .
they shook their heads at the visitors ' plan to stand guard at the frye ruins near the glen ; and , as they left , had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again .
there were rumblings under the hills that night , and the whippoorwills piped threateningly .
once in a while a wind , sweeping up out of cold spring glen , would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air ; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before , when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being .
but the terror did not appear .
whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time , and armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark .
morning came wanly , and the ceased .
it was a grey , bleak day , with now and then a drizzle of rain ; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the .
the men from arkham were undecided what to do .
seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed frye outbuildings , they debated the wisdom of waiting , or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless , monstrous quarry .
the downpour waxed in heaviness , and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons .
sheet lightning shimmered , and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand , as if descending into the accursed glen itself .
the sky grew very dark , and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short , sharp one followed by clear weather .
it was still gruesomely dark when , not much over an hour later , a confused babel of voices sounded down the road .
another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men , running , shouting , and even whimpering hysterically .
someone in the lead began sobbing out words , and the arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form .
, my gawd , my gawd , ' the voice choked out .
' agin , an ' this time by day !
it aout it aout an ' ' this very minute , an ' only the lord knows when it be on us all ! '
the speaker panted into silence , but another took up his message .
on a haour ago zeb whateley here heered the ' , an ' it was mis ' corey , george wife , that lives daown by the junction .
she says the hired boy luther was aout drivin ' in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt , when he see all the trees ' at the maouth o ' the glen opposite side ter this an ' smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las ' monday mornin ' .
an ' she says he says they was a swishin ' lappin ' saound , more nor what the bendin ' trees an ' bushes could make , an ' all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side , an ' they was a awful stompin ' an ' splashin ' in the mud .
but mind ye , luther he did see nothin ' at all , only just the bendin ' trees an ' underbrush .
fur ahead where bishop brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin ' an ' strainin ' on the bridge , an ' says he could tell the saound o ' wood ' to crack an ' split .
an ' all the whiles he never see a thing , only them trees an ' bushes ' .
an ' when the swishin ' saound got very fur off on the rud towards wizard whateley an ' sentinel hill luther he had the guts ter step up whar he heerd it fust an ' look at the graound .
it was all mud an ' water , an ' the sky was dark , an ' the rain was wipin ' aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be ; but beginnin ' at the glen maouth , whar the trees hed moved , they was still some o ' them awful prints big as like he seen monday . '
at this point the first excited speaker interrupted .
that ai the trouble naow that was only the start .
zeb here was callin ' folks up an ' everybody was ' in when a call from seth bishop cut in .
his haousekeeper sally was carryin ' on fit to kill she jest seed the trees ' beside the rud , an ' says they was a kind o ' mushy saound , like a elephant puffin ' an ' treadin ' , ' fer the haouse .
then she up an ' spoke suddent of a fearful smell , an ' says her boy was ' as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the whateley rewins monday mornin ' .
an ' the dogs was barkin ' an ' whinin ' awful .
' then she let aout a turrible yell , an ' says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over , only the wind strong enough to dew that .
everybody was ' , an ' we could hear lots o ' folks on the wire ' .
all to onct sally she yelled again , an ' says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up , though they no sign o ' what done it .
then everybody on the line could hear an ' old seth bishop ' tew , an ' sally was shriekin ' aout that suthin ' heavy hed struck the haouse not lightnin ' nor nothin ' , but suthin ' heavy again ' the front , that kep ' ' itself agin an ' agin , though ye could see nothin ' aout the front winders .
an ' then an ' then ' lines of fright deepened on every face ; and armitage , shaken as he was , had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker .
' then sally she yelled aout , o help , the haouse is ' in an ' on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin ' an ' a hull flock o ' screaming jes like when elmer frye place was took , only wuss ' the man paused , and another of the crowd spoke .
all not a saound nor squeak over the arter that .
jest .
we that heerd it got aout fords an ' wagons an ' rounded up as many as we could git , at corey place , an ' come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew .
not but what i think it the lord jedgment fer our iniquities , that no mortal kin ever set aside . '
armitage saw that the time for positive action had come , and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics .
must follow it , boys . '
he made his voice as reassuring as possible .
' i believe there a chance of putting it out of business .
you men know that those whateleys were wizards well , this thing is a thing of wizardry , and must be put down by the same means .
i seen wilbur whateley diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read ; and i think i know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away .
of course , one ca be sure , but we can always take a chance .
it invisible i knew it would be but there powder in this sprayer that might make it show up for a second .
later on we try it .
it a frightful thing to have alive , but it is as bad as what wilbur would have let in if he lived longer .
you never know what the world escaped .
now we only this one thing to fight , and it ca multiply .
it can , though , do a lot of harm ; so we must hesitate to rid the community of it .
must follow it and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked .
let somebody lead the way i do know your roads very well , but i an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots .
how about it ? '
the men shuffled about a moment , and then earl sawyer spoke softly , pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain .
' i guess ye kin git to seth bishop quickest by cuttin ' across the lower medder here , wadin ' the brook at the low place , an ' climbin ' through carrier mowin ' an ' the beyont .
that comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh seth a leetle side . '
armitage , with rice and morgan , started to walk in the direction indicated ; and most of the natives followed slowly .
the sky was growing lighter , and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away .
when armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction , joe osborn warned him and walked ahead to show the right one .
courage and confidence were mounting , though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay towards the end of their short cut , and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder , put these qualities to a severe test .
at length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out .
they were a little beyond the seth bishop place , but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks showed what had passed by .
only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just round the bend .
it was the frye incident all over again , and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the bishop house and barn .
no one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness , but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on towards the wrecked whateley farmhouse and the slopes of sentinel hill .
as the men passed the site of wilbur whateley abode they shuddered visibly , and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal .
it was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see , but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon .
opposite the base of sentinel hill the tracks left the road , and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster former route to and from the summit .
armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill .
then he handed the instrument to morgan , whose sight was keener .
after a moment of gazing morgan cried out sharply , passing the glass to earl sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger .
sawyer , as clumsy as most of optical devices are , fumbled a while ; but eventually focused the lenses with armitage aid .
when he did so his cry was less restrained than morgan had been .
almighty , the grass an ' bushes is ' !
it ' up creepin ' up ter the top this minute , heaven only knows what fur ! '
then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers .
it was one thing to chase the nameless entity , but quite another to find it .
spells might be all right but suppose they were ?
voices began questioning armitage about what he knew of the thing , and no reply seemed quite to satisfy .
everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of nature and of being utterly forbidden and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind .
x .
in the end the three men from arkham old , dr armitage , stocky , professor rice , and lean , youngish dr morgan , ascended the mountain alone .
after much patient instruction regarding its focusing and use , they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road ; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed round .
it was hard going , and armitage had to be helped more than once .
high above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker repassed with deliberateness .
then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining .
curtis whateley of the undecayed branch was holding the telescope when the arkham party detoured radically from the swath .
he told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending .
this , indeed , proved to be true ; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it .
then wesley corey , who had taken the glass , cried out that armitage was adjusting the sprayer which rice held , and that something must be about to happen .
the crowd stirred uneasily , recalling that his sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility .
two or three men shut their eyes , but curtis whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost .
he saw that rice , from the party point of advantage above and behind the entity , had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect .
those without the telescope saw only an instant flash of grey cloud a cloud about the size of a moderately large building near the top of the mountain .
curtis , who held the instrument , dropped it with a piercing shriek into the mud of the road .
he reeled , and would have crumbled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him .
all he could do was moan .
, oh , great gawd that that ' there was a pandemonium of questioning , and only henry wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud .
curtis was past all coherence , and even isolated replies were almost too much for him .
a barn all made o ' squirmin ' ropes hull thing sort o ' shaped like a hen egg anything with dozens o ' legs like that haff shut up when they step nothin ' solid abaout it all like jelly , an ' made o ' wrigglin ' ropes pushed clost together great bulgin ' eyes all over it ten or twenty maouths or trunks ' aout all along the sides , big as an all ' an openin ' an ' shuttin ' all grey , with kinder blue or purple rings an ' gawd it heaven that haff face on top ' this final memory , whatever it was , proved too much for poor curtis ; and he collapsed completely before he could say more .
fred farr and will hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass .
henry wheeler , trembling , turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might .
through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures , apparently running towards the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed .
only these nothing more .
then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind , and even in the underbrush of sentinel hill itself .
it was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills , and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy .
earl sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge , virtually level with the but at a considerable distance from it .
one figure , he said , seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals ; and as sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint , sound from the distance , as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures .
the weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness , but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation .
' i guess he sayin ' the spell , ' whispered wheeler as he snatched back the telescope .
the whippoorwills were piping wildly , and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual .
suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud .
it was a very peculiar phenomenon , and was plainly marked by all .
a rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills , mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky .
lightning flashed aloft , and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm .
the chanting of the men from arkham now became unmistakable , and wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation .
from some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs .
the change in the quality of the daylight increased , and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder .
a purplish darkness , born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky blue , pressed down upon the rumbling hills .
then the lightning flashed again , somewhat brighter than before , and the crowd fancied that it had showed a certain mistiness around the on the distant height .
no one , however , had been using the telescope at that instant .
the whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation , and the men of dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged .
without warning came those deep , cracked , raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them .
not from any human throat were they born , for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions .
rather would one have said they came from the pit itself , had not their source been so unmistakably the on the peak .
it is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all , since so much of their ghastly , timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear ; yet one must do so , since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of words .
they were loud loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed yet did they come from no visible being .
and because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of beings , the huddled crowd at the mountain base huddled still closer , and winced as if in expectation of a blow .
ygnailh ygnaiih rang the hideous croaking out of space .

the speaking impulse seemed to falter here , as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on .
henry wheeler strained his eye at the telescope , but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak , all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination .
from what black wells of acherontic fear or feeling , from what unplumbed gulfs of cosmic consciousness or obscure , heredity , were those drawn ?
presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark , utter , ultimate frenzy .
!
! ff ff ff !
!
!
but that was all .
the pallid group in the road , still reeling at the indisputably english syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking , were never to hear such syllables again .
instead , they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills ; the deafening , cataclysmic peal whose source , be it inner earth or sky , no hearer was ever able to place .
a single lightning bolt shot from the purple zenith to the , and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside .
trees , grass , and were whipped into a fury ; and the frightened crowd at the mountain base , weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them , were almost hurled off their feet .
dogs howled from the distance , green grass and foliage wilted to a curious , sickly , and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills .
the stench left quickly , but the vegetation never came right again .
to this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill curtis whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted .
they were grave and quiet , and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering .
in reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact .
thing has gone for ever , ' armitage said .
has been split up into what it was originally made of , and can never exist again .
it was an impossibility in a normal world .
only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know .
it was like its father and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe ; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills . '
there was a brief silence , and in that pause the scattered senses of poor curtis whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity ; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan .
memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off , and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again .
, oh , my gawd , that haff face that haff face on top of it that face with the red eyes an ' crinkly albino hair , an ' no chin , like the whateleys it was a octopus , centipede , spider kind o ' thing , but they was a man face on top of it , an ' it looked like wizard whateley , only it was yards an ' yards acrost ' he paused exhausted , as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallized into fresh terror .
only old zebulon whateley , who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore , spoke aloud .
year ' gone , ' he rambled , ' i heered ol ' whateley say as haow some day we hear a child o ' lavinny ' its father name on the top o ' sentinel hill ' but joe osborn interrupted him to question the arkham men anew .
was it , anyhaow , an ' haowever did young wizard whateley call it aout o ' the air it come from ? '
armitage chose his words very carefully .
was well , it was mostly a kind of force that does belong in our part of space ; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of nature .
we have no business calling in such things from outside , and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to .
there was some of it in wilbur whateley himself enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him , and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight .
i going to burn his accursed diary , and if you men are wise you dynamite that up there , and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills .
things like that brought down the beings those whateleys were so fond of the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose .
as to this thing we just sent back the whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come .
it grew fast and big from the same reason that wilbur grew fast and big but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it .
you need ask how wilbur called it out of the air .
he did call it out .
it was his twin brother , but it looked more like the father than he did . '
i bear in mind closely that i did not see any actual visual horror at the end .
to say that a mental shock was the cause of what i inferred that last straw which sent me racing out of the lonely akeley farmhouse and through the wild domed hills of vermont in a commandeered motor at night is to ignore the plainest facts of my final experience .
notwithstanding the deep things i saw and heard , and the admitted vividness the impression produced on me by these things , i can not prove even now whether i was right or wrong in my hideous inference .
for after all akeley disappearance establishes nothing .
people found nothing amiss in his house despite the on the outside and inside .
it was just as though he had walked out casually for a ramble in the hills and failed to return .
there was not even a sign that a guest had been there , or that those horrible cylinders and machines had been stored in the study .
that he had mortally feared the crowded green hills and endless trickle of brooks among which he had been born and reared , means nothing at all , either ; for thousands are subject to just such morbid fears .
eccentricity , moreover , could easily account for his strange acts and apprehensions toward the last .
the whole matter began , so far as i am concerned , with the historic and unprecedented vermont floods of november , .
i was then , as now , an instructor of literature at miskatonic university in arkham , massachusetts , and an enthusiastic amateur student of new england folklore .
shortly after the flood , amidst the varied reports of hardship , suffering , and organized relief which filled the press , there appeared certain odd stories of things found floating in some of the swollen rivers ; so that many of my friends embarked on curious discussions and appealed to me to shed what light i could on the subject .
i felt flattered at having my folklore study taken so seriously , and did what i could to belittle the wild , vague tales which seemed so clearly an outgrowth of old rustic superstitions .
it amused me to find several persons of education who insisted that some stratum of obscure , distorted fact might underlie the rumors .
the tales thus brought to my notice came mostly through newspaper cuttings ; though one yarn had an oral source and was repeated to a friend of mine in a letter from his mother in hardwick , vermont .
the type of thing described was essentially the same in all cases , though there seemed to be three separate instances involved one connected with the winooski river near montpelier , another attached to the west river in windham county beyond newfane , and a third centering in the passumpsic in caledonia county above lyndonville .
of course many of the stray items mentioned other instances , but on analysis they all seemed to boil down to these three .
in each case country folk reported seeing one or more very bizarre and disturbing objects in the surging waters that poured down from the unfrequented hills , and there was a widespread tendency to connect these sights with a primitive , cycle of whispered legend which old people resurrected for the occasion .
what people thought they saw were organic shapes not quite like any they had ever seen before .
naturally , there were many human bodies washed along by the streams in that tragic period ; but those who described these strange shapes felt quite sure that they were not human , despite some superficial resemblances in size and general outline .
nor , said the witnesses , could they have been any kind of animal known to vermont .
they were pinkish things about five feet long ; with crustaceous bodies bearing vast pairs of dorsal fins or membranous wings and several sets of articulated limbs , and with a sort of convoluted ellipsoid , covered with multitudes of very short antennae , where a head would ordinarily be .
it was really remarkable how closely the reports from different sources tended to coincide ; though the wonder was lessened by the fact that the old legends , shared at one time throughout the hill country , furnished a morbidly vivid picture which might well have coloured the imaginations of all the witnesses concerned .
it was my conclusion that such witnesses in every case naive and simple backwoods folk had glimpsed the battered and bloated bodies of human beings or farm animals in the whirling currents ; and had allowed the folklore to invest these pitiful objects with fantastic attributes .
the ancient folklore , while cloudy , evasive , and largely forgotten by the present generation , was of a highly singular character , and obviously reflected the influence of still earlier indian tales .
i knew it well , though i had never been in vermont , through the exceedingly rare monograph of eli davenport , which embraces material orally obtained prior to among the oldest people of the state .
this material , moreover , closely coincided with tales which i had personally heard from elderly rustics in the mountains of new hampshire .
briefly summarized , it hinted at a hidden race of monstrous beings which lurked somewhere among the remoter hills in the deep woods of the highest peaks , and the dark valleys where streams trickle from unknown sources .
these beings were seldom glimpsed , but evidences of their presence were reported by those who had ventured farther than usual up the slopes of certain mountains or into certain deep , gorges that even the wolves shunned .
there were queer footprints or in the mud of and barren patches , and curious circles of stones , with the grass around them worn away , which did not seem to have been placed or entirely shaped by nature .
there were , too , certain caves of problematical depth in the sides of the hills ; with mouths closed by boulders in a manner scarcely accidental , and with more than an average quota of the queer prints leading both toward and away from them if indeed the direction of these prints could be justly estimated .
and worst of all , there were the things which adventurous people had seen very rarely in the twilight of the remotest valleys and the dense perpendicular woods above the limits of normal .
it would have been less uncomfortable if the stray accounts of these things had not agreed so well .
as it was , nearly all the rumors had several points in common ; averring that the creatures were a sort of huge , crab with many pairs of legs and with two great batlike wings in the middle of the back .
they sometimes walked on all their legs , and sometimes on the hindmost pair only , using the others to convey large objects of indeterminate nature .
on one occasion they were spied in considerable numbers , a detachment of them wading along a shallow woodland watercourse three abreast in evidently disciplined formation .
once a specimen was seen flying launching itself from the top of a bald , lonely hill at night and vanishing in the sky after its great flapping wings had been silhouetted an instant against the full moon these things seemed content , on the whole , to let mankind alone ; though they were at times held responsible for the disappearance of venturesome individuals especially persons who built houses too close to certain valleys or too high up on certain mountains .
many localities came to be known as inadvisable to settle in , the feeling persisting long after the cause was forgotten .
people would look up at some of the neighbouring with a shudder , even when not recalling how many settlers had been lost , and how many farmhouses burnt to ashes , on the lower slopes of those grim , green sentinels .
but while according to the earliest legends the creatures would appear to have harmed only those trespassing on their privacy ; there were later accounts of their curiosity respecting men , and of their attempts to establish secret outposts in the human world .
there were tales of the queer seen around farmhouse windows in the morning , and of occasional disappearances in regions outside the obviously haunted areas .
tales , besides , of buzzing voices in imitation of human speech which made surprising offers to lone travelers on roads and in the deep woods , and of children frightened out of their wits by things seen or heard where the primal forest pressed close upon their .
in the final layer of legends the layer just preceding the decline of superstition and the abandonment of close contact with the dreaded places there are shocked references to hermits and remote farmers who at some period of life appeared to have undergone a repellent mental change , and who were shunned and whispered about as mortals who had sold themselves to the strange beings .
in one of the northeastern counties it seemed to be a fashion about to accuse eccentric and unpopular recluses of being allies or representatives of the abhorred things .
as to what the things were explanations naturally varied .
the common name applied to them was those ones , or the old ones , though other terms had a local and transient use .
perhaps the bulk of the puritan settlers set them down bluntly as familiars of the devil , and made them a basis of awed theological speculation .
those with celtic legendry in their heritage mainly the element of new hampshire , and their kindred who had settled in vermont on governor wentworth colonial grants linked them vaguely with the malign fairies and little people of the bogs and raths , and protected themselves with scraps of incantation handed down through many generations .
but the indians had the most fantastic theories of all .
while different tribal legends differed , there was a marked consensus of belief in certain vital particulars ; it being unanimously agreed that the creatures were not native to this earth .
the pennacook myths , which were the most consistent and picturesque , taught that the winged ones came from the great bear in the sky , and had mines in our earthly hills whence they took a kind of stone they could not get on any other world .
they did not live here , said the myths , but merely maintained outposts and flew back with vast cargoes of stone to their own stars in the north .
they harmed only those who got too near them or spied upon them .
animals shunned them through instinctive hatred , not because of being hunted .
they could not eat the things and animals of earth , but brought their own food from the stars .
it was bad to get near them , and sometimes young hunters who went into their hills never came back .
it was not good , either , to listen to what they whispered at night in the forest with voices like a bee that tried to be like the voices of men .
they knew the speech of all kinds of men pennacooks , hurons , men of the five nations but did not seem to have or need any speech of their own .
they talked with their heads , which changed colour in different ways to mean different things .
all the legendry , of course , white and indian alike , died down during the nineteenth century , except for occasional atavistical flareups .
the ways of the vermonters became settled ; and once their habitual paths and dwellings were established according to a certain fixed plan , they remembered less and less what fears and avoidances had determined that plan , and even that there had been any fears or avoidances .
most people simply knew that certain hilly regions were considered as highly unhealthy , unprofitable , and generally unlucky to live in , and that the farther one kept from them the better off one usually was .
in time the ruts of custom and economic interest became so deeply cut in approved places that there was no longer any reason for going outside them , and the haunted hills were left deserted by accident rather than by design .
save during infrequent local scares , only grandmothers and retrospective nonagenarians ever whispered of beings dwelling in those hills ; and even such whispers admitted that there was not much to fear from those things now that they were used to the presence of houses and settlements , and now that human beings let their chosen territory severely alone .
all this i had long known from my reading , and from certain folk tales picked up in new hampshire ; hence when the rumours began to appear , i could easily guess what imaginative background had evolved them .
i took great pains to explain this to my friends , and was correspondingly amused when several contentious souls continued to insist on a possible element of truth in the reports .
such persons tried to point out that the early legends had a significant persistence and uniformity , and that the virtually unexplored nature of the vermont hills made it unwise to be dogmatic about what might or might not dwell among them ; nor could they be silenced by my assurance that all the myths were of a pattern common to most of mankind and determined by early phases of imaginative experience which always produced the same type of delusion .
it was of no use to demonstrate to such opponents that the vermont myths differed but little in essence from those universal legends of natural personification which filled the ancient world with fauns and dryads and satyrs , suggested the kallikanzarai of modern greece , and gave to wild wales and ireland their dark hints of strange , small , and terrible hidden races of troglodytes and burrowers .
no use , either , to point out the even more startlingly similar belief of the nepalese hill tribes in the dreaded or abominable who lurk hideously amidst the ice and rock pinnacles of the himalayan summits .
when i brought up this evidence , my opponents turned it against me by claiming that it must imply some actual historicity for the ancient tales ; that it must argue the real existence of some queer elder , driven to hiding after the advent and dominance of mankind , which might very conceivably have survived in reduced numbers to relatively recent times or even to the present .
the more i laughed at such theories , the more these stubborn friends asseverated them ; adding that even without the heritage of legend the recent reports were too clear , consistent , detailed , and sanely prosaic in manner of telling , to be completely ignored .
two or three fanatical extremists went so far as to hint at possible meanings in the ancient indian tales which gave the hidden beings a nonterrestrial origin ; citing the extravagant books of charles fort with their claims that voyagers from other worlds and outer space have often visited the earth .
most of my foes , however , were merely romanticists who insisted on trying to transfer to real life the fantastic lore of lurking little people made popular by the magnificent of arthur machen .
as was only natural under the circumstances , this piquant debating finally got into print in the form of letters to the arkham advertiser ; some of which were copied in the press of those vermont regions whence the came .
the rutland herald gave half a page of extracts from the letters on both sides , while the brattleboro reformer reprinted one of my long historical and mythological summaries in full , with some accompanying comments in the pendrifter thoughtful column which supported and applauded my skeptical conclusions .
by the spring of i was almost a figure in vermont , notwithstanding the fact that i had never set foot in the state .
then came the challenging letters from henry akeley which impressed me so profoundly , and which took me for the first and last time to that fascinating realm of crowded green precipices and muttering forest streams .
most of what i know of henry wentworth akeley was gathered by correspondence with his neighbours , and with his only son in california , after my experience in his lonely farmhouse .
he was , i discovered , the last representative on his home soil of a long , locally distinguished line of jurists , administrators , and .
in him , however , the family mentally had veered away from practical affairs to pure scholarship ; so that he had been a notable student of mathematics , astronomy , biology , anthropology , and folklore at the university of vermont .
i had never previously heard of him , and he did not give many autobiographical details in his communications ; but from the first i saw he was a man of character , education , and intelligence , albeit a recluse with very little worldly sophistication .
despite the incredible nature of what he claimed , i could not help at once taking akeley more seriously than i had taken any of the other challengers of my views .
for one thing , he was really close to the actual phenomena visible and tangible that he speculated so grotesquely about ; and for another thing , he was amazingly willing to leave his conclusions in a tentative state like a true man of science .
he had no personal preferences to advance , and was always guided by what he took to be solid evidence .
of course i began by considering him mistaken , but gave him credit for being intelligently mistaken ; and at no time did i emulate some of his friends in attributing his ideas , and his fear of the lonely green hills , to insanity .
i could see that there was a great deal to the man , and knew that what he reported must surely come from strange circumstance deserving investigation , however little it might have to do with the fantastic causes he assigned .
later on i received from him certain material proofs which placed the matter on a somewhat different and bewilderingly bizarre basis .
i can not do better than transcribe in full , so far as is possible , the long letter in which akeley introduced himself , and which formed such an important landmark in my own intellectual history .
it is no longer in my possession , but my memory holds almost every word of its portentous message ; and again i affirm my confidence in the sanity of the man who wrote it .
here is the text a text which reached me in the cramped , scrawl of one who had obviously not mingled much with the world during his sedate , scholarly life .
.
, townshend , windham , vermont .
may albert wilmarth , , saltonstall , arkham , mass .
my dear sir i have read with great interest the brattleboro reformer reprint ( apr .
, ) of your letter on the recent stories of strange bodies seen floating in our flooded streams last fall , and on the curious folklore they so well agree with .
it is easy to see why an outlander would take the position you take , and even why pendrifter agrees with you .
that is the attitude generally taken by educated persons both in and out of vermont , and was my own attitude as a young man ( i am now ) before my studies , both general and in davenport book , led me to do some exploring in parts of the hills hereabouts not usually visited .
i was directed toward such studies by the queer old tales i used to hear from elderly farmers of the more ignorant sort , but now i wish i had let the whole matter alone .
i might say , with all proper modesty , that the subject of anthropology and folklore is by no means strange to me .
i took a good deal of it at college , and am familiar with most of the standard authorities such as tylor , lubbock , frazer , quatrefages , murray , osborn , keith , boule , elliott smith , and so on .
it is no news to me that tales of hidden races are as old as all mankind .
i have seen the reprints of letters from you , and those agreeing with you , in the rutland herald , and guess i know about where your controversy stands at the present time .
what i desire to say now is , that i am afraid your adversaries are nearer right than yourself , even though all reason seems to be on your side .
they are nearer right than they realise themselves for of course they go only by theory , and can not know what i know .
if i knew as little of the matter as they , i would feel justified in believing as they do .
i would be wholly on your side .
you can see that i am having a hard time getting to the point , probably because i really dread getting to the point ; but the upshot of the matter is that i have certain evidence that monstrous things do indeed live in the woods on the high hills which nobody visits .
i have not seen any of the things floating in the rivers , as reported , but i have seen things like them under circumstances i dread to repeat .
i have seen footprints , and of late have seen them nearer my own home ( i live in the old akeley place south of townshend village , on the side of dark mountain ) than i dare tell you now .
and i have overheard voices in the woods at certain points that i will not even begin to describe on paper .
at one place i heard them so much that i took a phonograph therewith a dictaphone attachment and wax blank and i shall try to arrange to have you hear the record i got .
i have run it on the machine for some of the old people up here , and one of the voices had nearly scared them paralysed by reason of its likeness to a certain voice ( that buzzing voice in the woods which davenport mentions ) that their grandmothers have told about and mimicked for them .
i know what most people think of a man who tells about hearing voices but before you draw conclusions just listen to this record and ask some of the older backwoods people what they think of it .
if you can account for it normally , very well ; but there must be something behind it .
ex nihilo nihil fit , you know .
now my object in writing you is not to start an argument but to give you information which i think a man of your tastes will find deeply interesting .
this is private .
publicly i am on your side , for certain things show me that it does not do for people to know too much about these matters .
my own studies are now wholly private , and i would not think of saying anything to attract people attention and cause them to visit the places i have explored .
it is true terribly true that there are creatures watching us all the time ; with spies among us gathering information .
it is from a wretched man who , if he was sane ( as i think he was ) was one of those spies , that i got a large part of my clues to the matter .
he later killed himself , but i have reason to think there are others now .
the things come from another planet , being able to live in interstellar space and fly through it on clumsy , powerful wings which have a way of resisting the aether but which are too poor at steering to be of much use in helping them about on earth .
i will tell you about this later if you do not dismiss me at once as a madman .
they come here to get metals from mines that go deep under the hills , and i think i know where they come from .
they will not hurt us if we let them alone , but no one can say what will happen if we get too curious about them .
of course a good army of men could wipe out their mining colony .
that is what they are afraid of .
but if that happened , more would come from outside any number of them .
they could easily conquer the earth , but have not tried so far because they have not needed to .
they would rather leave things as they are to save bother .
i think they mean to get rid of me because of what i have discovered .
there is a great black stone with unknown hieroglyphics half worn away which i found in the woods on round hill , east of here ; and after i took it home everything became different .
if they think i suspect too much they will either kill me or take me off the earth to where they come from .
they like to take away men of learning once in a while , to keep informed on the state of things in the human world .
this leads me to my secondary purpose in addressing you namely , to urge you to hush up the present debate rather than give it more publicity .
people must be kept away from these hills , and in order to effect this , their curiosity ought not to be aroused any further .
heaven knows there is peril enough anyway , with promoters and real estate men flooding vermont with herds of summer people to overrun the wild places and cover the hills with cheap bungalows .
i shall welcome further communication with you , and shall try to send you that phonograph record and black stone ( which is so worn that photographs do show much ) by express if you are willing .
i say try because i think those creatures have a way of tampering with things around here .
there is a sullen furtive fellow named brown , on a farm near the village , who i think is their spy .
little by little they are trying to cut me off from our world because i know too much about their world .
they have the most amazing way of finding out what i do .
you may not even get this letter .
i think i shall have to leave this part of the country and go live with my son in san diego , , if things get any worse , but it is not easy to give up the place you were born in , and where your family has lived for six generations .
also , i would hardly dare sell this house to anybody now that the creatures have taken notice of it .
they seem to be trying to get the black stone back and destroy the phonograph record , but i shall not let them if i can help it .
my great police dogs always hold them back , for there are very few here as yet , and they are clumsy in getting about .
as i have said , their wings are not much use for short flights on earth .
i am on the very brink of deciphering that stone in a very terrible way and with your knowledge of folklore you may be able to supply the missing links enough to help me .
i suppose you know all about the fearful myths antedating the coming of man to the earth the and cthulhu cycles which are hinted at in the necronomicon .
i had access to a copy of that once , and hear that you have one in your college library under lock and key .
to conclude , wilmarth , i think that with our respective studies we can be very useful to each other .
i do wish to put you in any peril , and suppose i ought to warn you that possession of the stone and the record wo be very safe ; but i think you will find any risks worth running for the sake of knowledge .
i will drive down to newfane or brattleboro to send whatever you authorize me to send , for the express offices there are more to be trusted .
i might say that i live quite alone now , since i ca keep hired help any more .
they wo stay because of the things that try to get near the house at night , and that keep the dogs barking continually .
i am glad i did get as deep as this into the business while my wife was alive , for it would have driven her mad .
hoping that i am not bothering you unduly , and that you will decide to get in touch with me rather than throw this letter into the waste basket as a madman raving , i am yrs .
very truly , henry akeley .
i am making some extra prints of certain photographs taken by me , which i think will help to prove a number of the points i have touched on .
the old people think they are monstrously true .
i shall send you these very soon if you are interested .
a .
it would be difficult to describe my sentiments upon reading this strange document for the first time .
by all ordinary rules , i ought to have laughed more loudly at these extravagances than at the far milder theories which had previously moved me to mirth ; yet something in the tone of the letter made me take it with paradoxical seriousness .
not that i believed for a moment in the hidden race from the stars which my correspondent spoke of ; but that , after some grave preliminary doubts , i grew to feel oddly sure of his sanity and sincerity , and of his confrontation by some genuine though singular and abnormal phenomenon which he could not explain except in this imaginative way .
it could not be as he thought it , i reflected , yet on the other hand , it could not be otherwise than worthy of investigation .
the man seemed unduly excited and alarmed about something , but it was hard to think that all cause was lacking .
he was so specific and logical in certain ways and after all , his yarn did fit in so perplexingly well with some of the old myths even the wildest indian legends .
that he had really overheard disturbing voices in the hills , and had really found the black stone he spoke about , was wholly possible despite the crazy inferences he had made inferences probably suggested by the man who had claimed to be a spy of the outer beings and had later killed himself .
it was easy to deduce that this man must have been wholly insane , but that he probably had a streak of perverse outward logic which made the naive akeley already prepared for such things by his folklore studies believe his tale .
as for the latest developments it appeared from his inability to keep hired help that akeley humbler rustic neighbours were as convinced as he that his house was besieged by uncanny things at night .
the dogs really barked , too .
and then the matter of that phonograph record , which i could not but believe he had obtained in the way he said .
it must mean something ; whether animal noises deceptively like human speech , or the speech of some hidden , human being decayed to a state not much above that of lower animals .
from this my thoughts went back to the black hieroglyphed stone , and to speculations upon what it might mean .
then , too , what of the photographs which akeley said he was about to send , and which the old people had found so convincingly terrible ?
as i the cramped handwriting i felt as never before that my credulous opponents might have more on their side than i had conceded .
after all , there might be some queer and perhaps hereditarily misshapen outcasts in those shunned hills , even though no such race of monsters as folklore claimed .
and if there were , then the presence of strange bodies in the flooded streams would not be wholly beyond belief .
was it too presumptuous to suppose that both the old legends and the recent reports had this much of reality behind them ?
but even as i harboured these doubts i felt ashamed that so fantastic a piece of bizarrerie as henry akeley wild letter had brought them up .
in the end i answered akeley letter , adopting a tone of friendly interest and soliciting further particulars .
his reply came almost by return mail ; and contained , true to promise , a number of kodak views of scenes and objects illustrating what he had to tell .
glancing at these pictures as i took them from the envelope , i felt a curious sense of fright and nearness to forbidden things ; for in spite of the vagueness of most of them , they had a damnably suggestive power which was intensified by the fact of their being genuine photographs actual optical links with what they portrayed , and the product of an impersonal transmitting process without prejudice , fallibility , or mendacity .
the more i looked at them , the more i saw that my serious estimate of akeley and his story had not been unjustified .
certainly , these pictures carried conclusive evidence of something in the vermont hills which was at least vastly outside the radius of our common knowledge and belief .
the worst thing of all was the footprint a view taken where the sun shone on a mud patch somewhere in a deserted upland .
this was no cheaply counterfeited thing , i could see at a glance ; for the sharply defined pebbles and grassblades in the field of vision gave a clear index of scale and left no possibility of a tricky double exposure .
i have called the thing a footprint , but would be a better term .
even now i can scarcely describe it save to say that it was hideously crablike , and that there seemed to be some ambiguity about its direction .
it was not a very deep or fresh print , but seemed to be about the size of an average man foot .
from a central pad , pairs of nippers projected in opposite directions quite baffling as to function , if indeed the whole object were exclusively an organ of locomotion .
another photograph evidently a taken in deep shadow was of the mouth of a woodland cave , with a boulder of rounded regularity choking the aperture .
on the bare ground in front of , it one could just discern a dense network of curious tracks , and when i studied the picture with a magnifier i felt uneasily sure that the tracks were like the one in the other view .
a third pictured showed a circle of standing stones on the summit of a wild hill .
around the cryptic circle the grass was very much beaten down and worn away , though i could not detect any footprints even with the glass .
the extreme remoteness of the place was apparent from the veritable sea of tenantless mountains which formed the background and stretched away toward a misty horizon .
but if the most disturbing of all the views was that of the footprint , the most curiously suggestive was that of the great black stone found in the round hill woods .
akeley had photographed it on what was evidently his study table , for i could see rows of books and a bust of milton in the background .
the thing , as nearly as one might guess , had faced the camera vertically with a somewhat irregularly curved surface of one by two feet ; but to say anything definite about that surface , or about the general shape of the whole mass , almost defies the power of language .
what outlandish geometrical principles had guided its cutting for artificially cut it surely was i could not even begin to guess ; and never before had i seen anything which struck me as so strangely and unmistakably alien to this world .
of the hieroglyphics on the surface i could discern very few , but one or two that i did see gave rather a shock .
of course they might be fraudulent , for others besides myself had read the monstrous and abhorred necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred ; but it nevertheless made me shiver to recognise certain ideographs which study had taught me to link with the most and blasphemous whispers of things that had had a kind of mad before the earth and the other inner worlds of the solar system were made .
of the five remaining pictures , three were of swamp and hill scenes which seemed to bear traces of hidden and unwholesome tenancy .
another was of a queer mark in the ground very near akeley house , which he said he had photographed the morning after a night on which the dogs had barked more violently than usual .
it was very blurred , and one could really draw no certain conclusions from it ; but it did seem fiendishly like that other mark or photographed on the deserted upland .
the final picture was of the akeley place itself ; a trim white house of two stories and attic , about a century and a quarter old , and with a lawn and path leading up to a tastefully carved georgian doorway .
there were several huge police dogs on the lawn , squatting near a man with a grey beard whom i took to be akeley himself his own photographer , one might infer from the bulb in his right hand .
from the pictures i turned to the bulky , letter itself ; and for the next three hours was immersed in a gulf of unutterable horror .
where akeley had given only outlines before , he now entered into minute details ; presenting long transcripts of words overheard in the woods at night , long accounts of monstrous pinkish forms spied in thickets at twilight on the hills , and a terrible cosmic narrative derived from the application of profound and varied scholarship to the endless bygone discourses of the mad spy who had killed himself .
i found myself faced by names and terms that i had heard elsewhere in the most hideous of connections yuggoth , great cthulhu , tsathoggua , yogsothoth , , nyarlathotep , azathoth , hastur , yian , leng , the lake of hali , bethmoora , the yellow sign , , bran , and the magnum innominandum and was drawn back through nameless aeons and inconceivable dimensions to worlds of elder , outer entity at which the crazed author of the necronomicon had only guessed in the vaguest way .
i was told of the pits of primal life , and of the streams that had trickled down therefrom ; and finally , of the tiny rivulets from one of those streams which had become entangled with the destinies of our own earth .
my brain whirled ; and where before i had attempted to explain things away , i now began to believe in the most abnormal and incredible wonders .
the array of vital evidence was damnably vast and overwhelming ; and the cool , scientific attitude of akeley an attitude removed as far as imaginable from the demented , the fanatical , the hysterical , or even the extravagantly speculative had a tremendous effect on my thought and judgment .
by the time i laid the frightful letter aside i could understand the fears he had come to entertain , and was ready to do anything in my power to keep people away from those wild , haunted hills .
even now , when time has dulled the impression and made me my own experience and horrible doubts , there are things in that letter of akeley which i would not quote , or even form into words on paper .
i am almost glad that the letter and record and photographs are gone now and i wish , for reasons i shall soon make clear , that the new planet beyond neptune had not been discovered .
with the reading of that letter my public debating about the vermont horror permanently ended .
arguments from opponents remained unanswered or put off with promises , and eventually the controversy petered out into oblivion .
during late may and june i was in constant correspondence with akeley ; though once in a while a letter would be lost , so that we would have to retrace our ground and perform considerable laborious copying .
what we were trying to do , as a whole , was to compare notes in matters of obscure mythological scholarship and arrive at a clearer correlation of the vermont horrors with the general body of primitive world legend .
for one thing , we virtually decided that these morbidities and the hellish himalayan were one and the same order of incarnated nightmare .
there was also absorbing zoological conjectures , which i would have referred to professor dexter in my own college but for akeley imperative command to tell no one of the matter before us .
if i seem to disobey that command now , it is only because i think that at this stage a warning about those farther vermont hills and about those himalayan peaks which bold explorers are more and more determined to ascend is more conducive to public safety than silence would be .
one specific thing we were leading up to was a deciphering of the hieroglyphics on that infamous black stone a deciphering which might well place us in possession of secrets deeper and more dizzying than any formerly known to man .
toward the end of june the phonograph record came shipped from brattleboro , since akeley was unwilling to trust conditions on the branch line north of there .
he had begun to feel an increased sense of espionage , aggravated by the loss of some of our letters ; and said much about the insidious deeds of certain men whom he considered tools and agents of the hidden beings .
most of all he suspected the surly farmer walter brown , who lived alone on a hillside place near the deep woods , and who was often seen loafing around corners in brattleboro , bellows falls , newfane , and south londonderry in the most inexplicable and seemingly unmotivated way .
brown voice , he felt convinced , was one of those he had overheard on a certain occasion in a very terrible conversation ; and he had once found a footprint or clawprint near brown house which might possess the most ominous significance .
it had been curiously near some of brown own footprints footprints that faced toward it .
so the record was shipped from brattleboro , whither akeley drove in his ford car along the lonely vermont back roads .
he confessed in an accompanying note that he was beginning to be afraid of those roads , and that he would not even go into townshend for supplies now except in broad daylight .
it did not pay , he repeated again and again , to know too much unless one were very remote from those silent and problematical hills .
he would be going to california pretty soon to live with his son , though it was hard to leave a place where all one memories and ancestral feelings centered .
before trying the record on the commercial machine which i borrowed from the college administration building i carefully went over all the explanatory matter in akeley various letters .
this record , he had said , was obtained about on the of may , , near the closed mouth of a cave where the wooded west slope of dark mountain rises out of lee swamp .
the place had always been unusually plagued with strange voices , this being the reason he had brought the phonograph , dictaphone , and blank in expectation of results .
former experience had told him that may eve the hideous of underground european legend would probably be more fruitful than any other date , and he was not disappointed .
it was noteworthy , though , that he never again heard voices at that particular spot .
unlike most of the overheard forest voices , the substance of the record was , and included one palpably human voice which akeley had never been able to place .
it was not brown , but seemed to be that of a man of greater cultivation .
the second voice , however , was the real crux of the thing for this was the accursed buzzing which had no likeness to humanity despite the human words which it uttered in good english grammar and a scholarly accent .
the recording phonograph and dictaphone had not worked uniformly well , and had of course been at a great disadvantage because of the remote and muffled nature of the overheard ritual ; so that the actual speech secured was very fragmentary .
akeley had given me a transcript of what he believed the spoken words to be , and i glanced through this again as i prepared the machine for action .
the text was darkly mysterious rather than openly horrible , though a knowledge of its origin and manner of gathering gave it all the associative horror which any words could well possess .
i will present it here in full as i remember it and i am fairly confident that i know it correctly by heart , not only from reading the transcript , but from playing the record itself over and over again .
it is not a thing which one might readily forget !
( indistinguishable sounds ) ( a cultivated male human voice ) is the lord of the wood , even to and the gifts of the men of leng so from the wells of night to the gulfs of space , and from the gulfs of space to the wells of night , ever the praises of great cthulhu , of tsathoggua , and of him who is not to be named .
ever their praises , and abundance to the black goat of the woods .
ia !
!
the goat with a thousand young !
( a buzzing imitation of human speech ) ia !
!
the black goat of the woods with a thousand young !
( human voice ) and it has come to pass that the lord of the woods , being seven and nine , down the onyx steps ( tri ) butes to him in the gulf , azathoth , he of whom thou has taught us marv ( els ) on the wings of night out beyond space , out beyond th to that whereof yuggoth is the youngest child , rolling alone in black aether at the rim ( buzzing voice ) go out among men and find the ways thereof , that he in the gulf may know .
to nyarlathotep , mighty messenger , must all things be told .
and he shall put on the semblance of men , the waxen mask and the robe that hides , and come down from the world of seven suns to mock ( human voice ) ( nyarl ) athotep , great messenger , bringer of strange joy to yuggoth through the void , father of the million favoured ones , stalker among ( speech cut off by end of record ) such were the words for which i was to listen when i started the phonograph .
it was with a trace of genuine dread and reluctance that i pressed the lever and heard the preliminary scratching of the sapphire point , and i was glad that the first faint , fragmentary words were in a human voice a mellow , educated voice which seemed vaguely bostonian in accent , and which was certainly not that of any native of the vermont hills .
as i listened to the tantalisingly feeble rendering , i seemed to find the speech identical with akeley carefully prepared transcript .
on it chanted , in that mellow bostonian voice ia !
!
the goat with a thousand young !
and then i heard the other voice .
to this hour i shudder retrospectively when i think of how it struck me , prepared though i was by akeley accounts .
those to whom i have since described the record profess to find nothing but cheap imposture or madness in it ; but could they have the accursed thing itself , or read the bulk of akeley correspondence , ( especially that terrible and encyclopaedic second letter ) , i know they would think differently .
it is , after all , a tremendous pity that i did not disobey akeley and play the record for others a tremendous pity , too , that all of his letters were lost .
to me , with my impression of the actual sounds , and with my knowledge of the background and surrounding circumstances , the voice was a monstrous thing .
it swiftly followed the human voice in ritualistic response , but in my imagination it was a morbid echo winging its way across unimaginable abysses from unimaginable outer hells .
it is more than two years now since i last ran off that blasphemous waxen cylinder ; but at this moment , and at all other moments , i can still hear that feeble , fiendish buzzing as it reached me for the first time .
ia !
!
the black goat of the woods with a thousand young !
but though the voice is always in my ears , i have not even yet been able to analyse it well enough for a graphic description .
it was like the drone of some loathsome , gigantic insect ponderously shaped into the articulate speech of an alien species , and i am perfectly certain that the organs producing it can have no resemblance to the vocal organs of man , or indeed to those of any of the mammalia .
there were singularities in timbre , range , and overtones which placed this phenomenon wholly outside the sphere of humanity and .
its sudden advent that first time almost stunned me , and i heard the rest of the record through in a sort of abstracted daze .
when the longer passage of buzzing came , there was a sharp intensification of that feeling of blasphemous infinity which had struck me during the shorter and earlier passage .
at last the record ended abruptly , during an unusually clear speech of the human and bostonian voice ; but i sat stupidly staring long after the machine had automatically stopped .
i hardly need say that i gave that shocking record many another playing , and that i made exhaustive attempts at analysis and comment in comparing notes with akeley .
it would be both useless and disturbing to repeat here all that we concluded ; but i may hint that we agreed in believing we had secured a clue to the source of some of the most repulsive primordial customs in the cryptic elder religions of mankind .
it seemed plain to us , also , that there were ancient and elaborate alliance ; between the hidden outer creatures and certain members of the human race .
how extensive these alliances were , and how their state today might compare with their state in earlier ages , we had no means of guessing ; yet at best there was room for a limitless amount of horrified speculation .
there seemed to be an awful , immemorial linkage in several definite stages betwixt man and nameless infinity .
the blasphemies which appeared on earth , it was hinted , came from the dark planet yuggoth , at the rim of the solar system ; but this was itself merely the populous outpost of a frightful interstellar race whose ultimate source must lie far outside even the einsteinian continuum or greatest known cosmos .
meanwhile we continued to discuss the black stone and the best way of getting it to arkham akeley deeming it inadvisable to have me visit him at the scene of his nightmare studies .
for some reason or other , akeley was afraid to trust the thing to any ordinary or expected transportation route .
his final idea was to take it across country to bellows falls and ship it on the boston and maine system through keene and winchendon and fitchburg , even though this would necessitate his driving along somewhat lonelier and more hill roads than the main highway to brattleboro .
he said he had noticed a man around the express office at brattleboro when he had sent the phonograph record , whose actions and expression had been far from reassuring .
this man had seemed too anxious to talk with the clerks , and had taken the train on which the record was shipped .
akeley confessed that he had not felt strictly at ease about that record until he heard from me of its safe receipt .
about this time the second week in july another letter of mine went astray , as i learned through an anxious communication from akeley .
after that he told me to address him no more at townshend , but to send all mail in care of the general delivery at brattleboro ; whither he would make frequent trips either in his car or on the line which had lately replaced passenger service on the lagging branch railway .
i could see that he was getting more and more anxious , for he went into much detail about the increased barking of the dogs on moonless nights , and about the fresh he sometimes found in the road and in the mud at the back of his farmyard when morning came .
once he told about a veritable army of prints drawn up in a line facing an equally thick and resolute line of , and sent a loathsomely disturbing kodak picture to prove it .
that was after a night on which the dogs had outdone themselves in barking and howling .
on the morning of wednesday , july , i received a telegram from bellows falls , in which akeley said he was expressing the black stone over the b .
on train no .
, leaving bellows falls at , standard time , and due at the north station in boston at .
it ought , i calculated , to get up to arkham at least by the next noon ; and accordingly i stayed in all thursday morning to receive it .
but noon came and went without its advent , and when i telephoned down to the express office i was informed that no shipment for me had arrived .
my next act , performed amidst a growing alarm , was to give a call to the express agent at the boston north station ; and i was scarcely surprised to learn that my consignment had not appeared .
train no .
had pulled in only minutes late on the day before , but had contained no box addressed to me .
the agent promised , however , to institute a searching inquiry ; and i ended the day by sending akeley a outlining the situation .
with commendable promptness a report came from the boston office on the following afternoon , the agent telephoning as soon as he learned the facts .
it seemed that the railway express clerk on no .
had been able to recall an incident which might have much bearing on my loss an argument with a very man , lean , sandy , and , when the train was waiting at keene , , shortly after one standard time .
the man , he said , was greatly excited about a heavy box which he claimed to expect , but which was neither on the train nor entered on the company books .
he had given the name of stanley adams , and had had such a queerly thick droning voice , that it made the clerk abnormally dizzy and sleepy to listen to him .
the clerk could not remember quite how the conversation had ended , but recalled starting into a fuller awakeness when the train began to move .
the boston agent added that this clerk was a young man of wholly unquestioned veracity and reliability , of known antecedents and long with the company .
that evening i went to boston to interview the clerk in person , having obtained his name and address from the office .
he was a frank , prepossessing fellow , but i saw that he could add nothing to his original account .
oddly , he was scarcely sure that he could even recognise the strange inquirer again .
realising that he had no more to tell , i returned to arkham and sat up till morning writing letters to akeley , to the express company and to the police department and station agent in keene .
i felt that the man who had so queerly affected the clerk must have a pivotal place in the ominous business , and hoped that keene station employees and records might tell something about him and about how he happened to make his inquiry when and where he did .
i must admit , however , that all my investigations came to nothing .
the man had indeed been noticed around the keene station in the early afternoon of july , and one lounger seemed to couple him vaguely with a heavy box ; but he was altogether unknown , and had not been seen before or since .
he had not visited the telegraph office or received any message so far as could be learned , nor had any message which might justly be considered a notice of the black stone presence on no .
come through the office for anyone .
naturally akeley joined with me in conducting these inquiries , and even made a personal trip to keene to question the people around the station ; but his attitude toward the matter was more fatalistic than mine .
he seemed to find the loss of the box a portentous and menacing fulfillment of inevitable tendencies , and had no real hope at all of its recovery .
he spoke of the undoubted telepathic and hypnotic powers of the hill creatures and their agents , and in one letter hinted that he did not believe the stone was on this earth any longer .
for my part , i was duly enraged , for i had felt there was at least a chance of learning profound and astonishing things from the old , blurred hieroglyphs .
the matter would have rankled bitterly in my mind had not akeley immediately subsequent letters brought up a new phase of the whole horrible hill problem which at once seized all my attention .
the unknown things , akeley wrote in a script grown pitifully tremulous , had begun to close in on him with a wholly new degree of determination .
the nocturnal barking of the dogs whenever the moon .
was dim or absent was hideous now , and there had been attempts to molest him on the lonely roads he had to traverse by day .
on the second of august , while bound for the village in his car , he had found a laid in his path at a point where the highway ran through a deep patch of woods ; while the savage barking of the two great dogs he had with him told all too well of the things which must have been lurking near .
what would have happened had the dogs not been there , he did not dare guess but he never went out now without at least two of his faithful and powerful pack .
other road experiences had occurred on august fifth and sixth ; a shot grazing his car on one occasion , and the barking of the dogs telling of unholy woodland presences on the other .
on august fifteenth i received a frantic letter which disturbed me greatly , and which made me wish akeley could put aside his lonely reticence and call in the aid of the law .
there had been frightful happening on the night of the , bullets flying outside the farmhouse , and three of the twelve great dogs being found shot dead in the morning .
there were myriads of in the road , with the human prints of walter brown among them .
akeley had started to telephone to brattleboro for more dogs , but the wire had gone dead before he had a chance to say much .
later he went to brattleboro in his car , and learned there that linemen had found the main cable neatly cut at a point where it ran through the deserted hills north of newfane .
but he was about to start home with four fine new dogs , and several cases of ammunition for his repeating rifle .
the letter was written at the post office in brattleboro , and came through to me without delay .
my attitude toward the matter was by this time quickly slipping from a scientific to an alarmedly personal one .
i was afraid for akeley in his remote , lonely farmhouse , and half afraid for myself because of my now definite connection with the strange hill problem .
the thing was reaching out so .
would it suck me in and engulf me ?
in replying to his letter i urged him to seek help , and hinted that i might take action myself if he did not .
i spoke of visiting vermont in person in spite of his wishes , and of helping him explain the situation to the proper authorities .
in return , however , i received only a telegram from bellows falls which read thus but the affair was steadily deepening .
upon my replying to the telegram i received a shaky note from akeley with the astonishing news that he had not only never sent the wire , but had not received the letter from me to which it was an obvious reply .
hasty inquiries by him at bellows falls had brought out that the message was deposited by a strange man with a curiously thick , droning voice , though more than this he could not learn .
the clerk showed him the original text as scrawled in pencil by the sender , but the handwriting was wholly unfamiliar .
it was noticeable that the signature was misspelled , without the second certain conjectures were inevitable , but amidst the obvious crisis he did not stop to elaborate upon them , he spoke of the death of more dogs and the purchase of still others , and of the exchange of gunfire which had become a settled feature each moonless night .
brown prints , and the prints of at least one or two more shod human figures , were now found regularly among the in the road , and at the back of the farmyard .
it was , akeley admitted , a pretty bad business ; and before long he would probably have to go to live with his california son whether or not he could sell the old place .
but it was not easy to leave the only spot one could really think of as home .
he must try to hang on a little longer ; perhaps he could scare off the intruders especially if he openly gave up all further attempts to penetrate their secrets .
writing akeley at once , i renewed my offers of aid , and spoke again of visiting him and helping him convince the authorities of his dire peril .
in his reply he seemed less set against that plan than his past attitude would have led one to predict , but said he would like to hold off a little while longer long enough to get his things in order and reconcile himself to the idea of leaving an almost morbidly cherished birthplace .
people looked askance at his studies and speculations and it would be better to get quietly off without setting the countryside in a turmoil and creating widespread doubts of his own sanity .
he had had enough , he admitted , but he wanted to make a dignified exit if he could .
this letter reached me on the of august , and i prepared and mailed as encouraging a reply as i could .
apparently the encouragement had effect , for akeley had fewer terrors to report when he acknowledged my note .
he was not very optimistic , though , and expressed the belief that it was only the full moon season which was holding the creatures off .
he hoped there would not be many densely cloudy nights , and talked vaguely of boarding in brattleboro when the moon waned .
again i wrote him encouragingly but on september there came a fresh communication which had obviously crossed my letter in the mails ; and to this i could not give any such hopeful response .
in view of its importance i believe i had better give it in full as best i can do from memory of the shaky script .
it ran substantially as follows monday dear wilmarth a rather discouraging to my last .
last night was thickly cloudy though no rain and not a bit of moonlight got through .
things were pretty bad , and i think the end is getting near , in spite of all we have hoped .
after midnight something landed on the roof of the house , and the dogs all rushed up to see what it was .
i could hear them snapping and tearing around , and then one managed to get on the roof by jumping from the low ell .
there was a terrible fight up there , and i heard a frightful buzzing which i never forget .
and then there was a shocking smell .
about the same time bullets came through the window and nearly grazed me .
i think the main line of the hill creatures had got close to the house when the dogs divided because of the roof business .
what was up there i do know yet , but i afraid the creatures are learning to steer better with their space wings .
i put out the light and used the windows for loopholes , and raked all around the house with rifle fire aimed just high enough not to hit the dogs .
that seemed to end the business , but in the morning i found great pools of blood in the yard , besides pools of a green sticky stuff that had the worst odour i have ever smelled .
i climbed up on the roof and found more of the sticky stuff there .
five of the dogs were killed i afraid i hit one myself by aiming too low , for he was shot in the back .
now i am setting the panes the shots broke , and am going to brattleboro for more dogs .
i guess the men at the kennels think i am crazy .
will drop another note later .
suppose i be ready for moving in a week or two , though it nearly kills me to think of it .
hastily akeley but this was not the only letter from akeley to cross mine .
on the next morning september still another came ; this time a frantic scrawl which utterly unnerved me and put me at a loss what to say or do next .
again i can not do better than quote the text as faithfully as memory will let me .
tuesday clouds did break , so no moon again and going into the wane anyhow .
i have the house wired for electricity and put in a searchlight if i did know they cut the cables as fast as they could be mended .
i think i am going crazy .
it may be that all i have ever written you is a dream or madness .
it was bad enough before , but this time it is too much .
they talked to me last night talked in that cursed buzzing voice and told me things that i dare not repeat to you .
i heard them plainly above the barking of the dogs , and once when they were drowned out a human voice helped them .
keep out of this , wilmarth it is worse than either you or i ever suspected .
they do mean to let me get to california now they want to take me off alive , or what theoretically and mentally amounts to alive not only to yuggoth , but beyond that away outside the galaxy and possibly beyond the last curved rim of space .
i told them i would go where they wish , or in the terrible way they propose to take me , but i afraid it will be no use .
my place is so far out that they may come by day as well as by night before long .
six more dogs killed , and i felt presences all along the wooded parts of the road when i drove to brattleboro today .
it was a mistake for me to try to send you that phonograph record and black stone .
better smash the record before it too late .
will drop you another line tomorrow if i still here .
wish i could arrange to get my books and things to brattleboro and board there .
i would run off without anything if i could but something inside my mind holds me back .
i can slip out to brattleboro , where i ought to be safe , but i feel just as much a prisoner there as at the house .
and i seem to know that i could get much farther even if i dropped everything and tried .
it is horrible do get mixed up in this .
yrs akeley i did not sleep at all the night after receiving this terrible thing , and was utterly baffled as to akeley remaining degree of sanity .
the substance of the note was wholly insane , yet the manner of expression in view of all that had gone before had a grimly potent quality of convincingness .
i made no attempt to answer it , thinking it better to wait until akeley might have time to reply to my latest communication .
such a reply indeed came on the following day , though the fresh material in it quite overshadowed any of the points brought up by the letter nominally answered .
here is what i recall of the text , scrawled and blotted as it was in the course of a plainly frantic and hurried composition .
wednesday w your letter came , but it no use to discuss anything any more .
i am fully resigned .
wonder that i have even enough will power left to fight them off .
ca escape even if i were willing to give up everything and run .
they get me .
had a letter from them yesterday .
man brought it while i was at brattleboro .
typed and postmarked bellows falls .
tells what they want to do with me i ca repeat it .
look out for yourself , too !
smash that record .
cloudy nights keep up , and moon waning all the time .
wish i dared to get help it might brace up my will power but everyone who would dare to come at all would call me crazy unless there happened to be some proof .
could ask people to come for no reason at all am all out of touch with everybody and have been for years .
but i have told you the worst , wilmarth .
brace up to read this , for it will give you a shock .
i am telling the truth , though .
it is this i have seen and touched one of the things , or part of one of the things .
god , man , but it awful !
it was dead , of course .
one of the dogs had it , and i found it near the kennel this morning .
i tried to save it in the woodshed to convince people of the whole thing , but it all evaporated in a few hours .
nothing left .
you know , all those things in the rivers were seen only on the first morning after the flood .
and here the worst .
i tried to photograph it for you , but when i developed the film there was anything visible except the woodshed .
what can the thing have been made of ?
i saw it and felt it , and they all leave footprints .
it was surely made of matter but what kind of matter ?
the shape ca be described .
it was a great crab with a lot of pyramided fleshy rings or knots of thick , ropy stuff covered with feelers where a man head would be .
that green sticky stuff is its blood or juice .
and there are more of them due on earth any minute .
walter brown is missing has been seen loafing around any of his usual corners in the villages hereabouts .
i must have got him with one of my shots , though the creatures always seem to try to take their dead and wounded away .
got into town this afternoon without any trouble , but am afraid they beginning to hold off because they sure of me .
am writing this in brattleboro o .
this may be goodbye if it is , write my son george goodenough akeley , pleasant , san diego , , but do come up here .
write the boy if you do hear from me in a week , and watch the papers for news .
i going to play my last two cards now if i have the will power left .
first to try poison gas on the things ( i got the right chemicals and have fixed up masks for myself and the dogs ) and then if that does work , tell the sheriff .
they can lock me in a madhouse if they want to it be better than what the other creatures would do .
perhaps i can get them to pay attention to the prints around the house they are faint , but i can find them every morning .
suppose , though , police would say i faked them somehow ; for they all think i a queer character .
must try to have a state policeman spend a night here and see for himself though it would be just like the creatures to learn about it and hold off that night .
they cut my wires whenever i try to telephone in the night the linemen think it is very queer , and may testify for me if they do go and imagine i cut them myself .
i have tried to keep them repaired for over a week now .
i could get some of the ignorant people to testify for me about the reality of the horrors , but everybody laughs at what they say , and anyway , they have shunned my place for so long that they do know any of the new events .
you could get one of those rundown farmers to come within a mile of my house for love or money .
the hears what they say and jokes me about it god !
if i only dared tell him how real it is !
i think i try to get him to notice the prints , but he comes in the afternoon and they usually about gone by that time .
if i kept one by setting a box or pan over it , he think surely it was a fake or joke .
wish i had gotten to be such a hermit , so folks do drop around as they used to .
i never dared show the black stone or the kodak pictures , or play that record , to anybody but the ignorant people .
the others would say i faked the whole business and do nothing but laugh .
but i may yet try showing the pictures .
they give those clearly , even if the things that made them ca be photographed .
what a shame nobody else saw that thing this morning before it went to nothing !
but i do know as i care .
after what i been through , a madhouse is as good a place as any .
the doctors can help me make up my mind to get away from this house , and that is all that will save me .
write my son george if you do hear soon .
goodbye , smash that record , and do mix up in this .
yrs akeley this letter frankly plunged me into the blackest of terror .
i did not know what to say in answer , but scratched off some incoherent words of advice and encouragement and sent them by registered mail .
i recall urging akeley to move to brattleboro at once , and place himself under the protection of the authorities ; adding that i would come to that town with the phonograph record and help convince the courts of his sanity .
it was time , too , i think i wrote , to alarm the people generally against this thing in their midst .
it will be observed that at this moment of stress my own belief in all akeley had told and claimed was virtually complete , though i did think his failure to get a picture of the dead monster was due not to any freak of nature but to some excited slip of his own .
v then , apparently crossing my incoherent note and reaching me saturday afternoon , september , came that curiously different and calming letter neatly typed on a new machine ; that strange letter of reassurance and invitation which must have marked so prodigious a transition in the whole nightmare drama of the lonely hills .
again i will quote from memory seeking for special reasons to preserve as much of the flavour of the style as i can .
it was postmarked bellows falls , and the signature as well as the body of the letter was typed as is frequent with beginners in typing .
the text , though , was marvellously accurate for a tyro work ; and i concluded that akeley must have used a machine at some previous period perhaps in college .
to say that the letter relieved me would be only fair , yet beneath my relief lay a substratum of uneasiness .
if akeley had been sane in his terror , was he now sane in his deliverance ?
and the sort of improved rapport mentioned what was it ?
the entire thing implied such a diametrical reversal of akeley previous attitude !
but here is the substance of the text , carefully transcribed from a memory in which i take some pride .
townshend , vermont , thursday , , .
my dear wilmarth it gives me great pleasure to be able to set you at rest regarding all the silly things i been writing you .
i say silly , although by that i mean my frightened attitude rather than my descriptions of certain phenomena .
those phenomena are real and important enough ; my mistake had been in establishing an anomalous attitude toward them .
i think i mentioned that my strange visitors were beginning to communicate with me , and to attempt such communication .
last night this exchange of speech became actual .
in response to certain signals i admitted to the house a messenger from those outside a , let me hasten to say .
he told me much that neither you nor i had even begun to guess , and showed clearly how totally we had misjudged and misinterpreted the purpose of the outer ones in maintaining their secret colony on this planet .
it seems that the evil legends about what they have offered to men , and what they wish in connection with the earth , are wholly the result of an ignorant misconception of allegorical speech speech , of course , moulded by cultural backgrounds and vastly different from anything we dream of .
my own conjectures , i freely own , shot as widely past the mark as any of the guesses of illiterate farmers and savage indians .
what i had thought morbid and shameful and ignominious is in reality awesome and and even glorious my previous estimate being merely a phase of man eternal tendency to hate and fear and shrink from the utterly different .
now i regret the harm i have inflicted upon these alien and incredible beings in the course of our nightly skirmishes .
if only i had consented to talk peacefully and reasonably with them in the first place !
but they bear me no grudge , their emotions being organised very differently from ours .
it is their misfortune to have had as their human agents in vermont some very inferior specimens the late walter brown , for example .
he prejudiced me vastly against them .
actually , they have never knowingly harmed men , but have often been cruelly wronged and spied upon by our species .
there is a whole secret cult of evil men ( a man of your mystical erudition will understand me when i link them with hastur and the yellow sign ) devoted to the purpose of tracking them down and injuring them on behalf of monstrous powers from other dimensions .
it is against these aggressors not against normal humanity that the drastic precautions of the outer ones are directed .
incidentally , i learned that many of our lost letters were stolen not by the outer ones but by the emissaries of this malign cult .
all that the outer ones wish of man is peace and and an increasing intellectual rapport .
this latter is absolutely necessary now that our inventions and devices are expanding our knowledge and motions , and making it more and more impossible for the outer ones ' necessary outposts to exist secretly on this planet .
the alien beings desire to know mankind more fully , and to have a few of mankind philosophic and scientific leaders know more about them .
with such an exchange of knowledge all perils will pass , and a satisfactory modus vivendi be established .
the very idea of any attempt to enslave or degrade mankind is ridiculous .
as a beginning of this improved rapport , the outer ones have naturally chosen me whose knowledge of them is already so considerable as their primary interpreter on earth .
much was told me last night facts of the most stupendous and nature and more will be subsequently communicated to me both orally and in writing .
i shall not be called upon to make any trip outside just yet , though i shall probably wish to do so later on employing special means and transcending everything which we have hitherto been accustomed to regard as human experience .
my house will be besieged no longer .
everything has reverted to normal , and the dogs will have no further occupation .
in place of terror i have been given a rich boon of knowledge and intellectual adventure which few other mortals have ever shared .
the outer beings are perhaps the most marvellous organic things in or beyond all space and of a race of which all other are merely degenerate variants .
they are more vegetable than animal , if these terms can be applied to the sort of matter composing them , and have a somewhat fungoid structure ; though the presence of a substance and a very singular nutritive system differentiate them altogether from true cormophytic fungi .
indeed , the type is composed of a form of matter totally alien to our part of space with electrons having a wholly different .
that is why the beings can not be photographed on the ordinary camera films and plates of our known universe , even though our eyes can see them .
with proper knowledge , however , any good chemist could make a photographic emulsion which would record their images .
the genus is unique in its ability to traverse the heatless and airless interstellar void in full corporeal form , and some of its variants can not do this without mechanical aid or curious surgical transpositions .
only a few species have the wings characteristic of the vermont variety .
those inhabiting certain remote peaks in the old world were brought in other ways .
their external resemblance to animal life , and to the sort of structure we understand as material , is a matter of parallel evolution rather than of close kinship .
their exceeds that of any other surviving , although the winged types of our hill country are by no means the most highly developed .
telepathy is their usual means of discourse , though we have rudimentary vocal organs which , after a slight operation ( for surgery is an incredibly expert and everyday thing among them ) , can roughly duplicate the speech of such types of organism as still use speech .
their main immediate abode is a still undiscovered and almost lightless planet at the very edge of our solar system beyond neptune , and the ninth in distance from the sun .
it is , as we have inferred , the object mystically hinted at as yuggoth in certain ancient and forbidden writings ; and it will soon be the scene of a strange focussing of thought upon our world in an effort to facilitate mental rapport .
i would not be surprised if astronomers become sufficiently sensitive to these to discover yuggoth when the outer ones wish them to do so .
but yuggoth , of course , is only the .
the main body of the beings inhabits strangely organized abysses wholly beyond the utmost reach of any human imagination .
the globule which we recognize as the totality of all cosmic entity is only an atom in the genuine infinity which is theirs .
and as much of this infinity as any human brain can hold is eventually to be opened up to me , as it has been to not more than fifty other men since the human race has existed .
you will probably call this raving at first , wilmarth , but in time you will appreciate the titanic opportunity i have stumbled upon .
i want you to share as much of it as is possible , and to that end must tell you thousands of things that wo go on paper .
in the past i have warned you not to come to see me .
now that all is safe , i take pleasure in rescinding that warning and inviting you .
ca you make a trip up here before your college term opens ?
it would be marvelously delightful if you could .
bring along the phonograph record and all my letters to you as consultative data we shall need them in piecing together the whole tremendous story .
you might bring the kodak prints , too , since i seem to have mislaid the negatives and my own prints in all this recent excitement .
but what a wealth of facts i have to add to all this groping and tentative material and what a stupendous device i have to supplement my additions !
do hesitate i am free from espionage now , and you will not meet anything unnatural or disturbing .
just come along and let my car meet you at the brattleboro station prepare to stay as long as you can , and expect many an evening of discussion of things beyond all human conjecture .
do tell anyone about it , of course for this matter must not get to the promiscuous public .
the train service to brattleboro is not bad you can get a timetable in boston .
take the b .
to greenfield , and then change for the brief remainder of the way .
i suggest your taking the convenient standard from boston .
this gets into greenfield at , and at a train leaves there which reaches brattleboro at .
that is weekdays .
let me know the date and i have my car on hand at the station .
pardon this typed letter , but my handwriting has grown shaky of late , as you know , and i do feel equal to long stretches of script .
i got this new corona in brattleboro yesterday it seems to work very well .
awaiting word , and hoping to see you shortly with the phonograph record and all my letters and the kodak prints i am yours in anticipation , henry akeley , , , , .
the complexity of my emotions upon reading , , and pondering over this strange and letter is past adequate description .
i have said that i was at once relieved and made uneasy , but this expresses only crudely the overtones of diverse and largely subconscious feelings which comprised both the relief and the uneasiness .
to begin with , the thing was so antipodally at variance with the whole chain of horrors preceding it the change of mood from stark terror to cool complacency and even exultation was so unheralded , , and complete !
i could scarcely believe that a single day could so alter the psychological perspective of one who had written that final frenzied bulletin of wednesday , no matter what relieving disclosures that day might have brought .
at certain moments a sense of conflicting unrealities made me wonder whether this whole distantly reported drama of fantastic forces were not a kind of dream created largely within my own mind .
then i thought of the phonograph record and gave way to still greater bewilderment .
the letter seemed so unlike anything which could have been expected !
as i analysed my impression , i saw that it consisted of two distinct phases .
first , granting that akeley had been sane before and was still sane , the indicated change in the situation itself was so swift and unthinkable .
and secondly , the change in akeley own manner , attitude , and language was so vastly beyond the normal or the predictable .
the man whole personality seemed to have undergone an insidious mutation a mutation so deep that one could scarcely reconcile his two aspects with the supposition that both represented equal sanity .
, spelling all were subtly different .
and with my academic sensitiveness to prose style , i could trace profound divergences in his commonest reactions and .
certainly , the emotional cataclysm or revelation which could produce so radical an overturn must be an extreme one indeed !
yet in another way the letter seemed quite characteristic of akeley .
the same old passion for infinity the same old scholarly inquisitiveness .
i could not a moment or more than a moment credit the idea of spuriousness or malign substitution .
did not the invitation the willingness to have me test the truth of the letter in person prove its genuineness ?
i did not retire saturday night , but sat up thinking of the shadows and marvels behind the letter i had received .
my mind , aching from the quick succession of monstrous conceptions it had been forced to confront during the last four months , worked upon this startling new material in a cycle of doubt and acceptance which repeated most of the steps experienced in facing the earlier wonders ; till long before dawn a burning interest and curiosity had begun to replace the original storm of perplexity and uneasiness .
mad or sane , metamorphosed or merely relieved , the chances were that akeley had actually encountered some stupendous change of perspective in his hazardous research ; some change at once diminishing his danger real or fancied and opening dizzy new vistas of cosmic and superhuman knowledge .
my own zeal for the unknown flared up to meet his , and i felt myself touched by the contagion of the morbid .
to shake off the maddening and wearying limitations of time and space and natural law to be linked with the vast outside to come close to the nighted and abysmal secrets of the infinite and the ultimate surely such a thing was worth the risk of one life , soul , and sanity !
and akeley had said there was no longer any peril he had invited me to visit him instead of warning me away as before .
i tingled at the thought of what he might now have to tell me there was an almost paralysing fascination in the thought of sitting in that lonely and farmhouse with a man who had talked with actual emissaries from outer space ; sitting there with the terrible record and the pile of letters in which akeley had summarised his earlier conclusions .
so late sunday morning i telegraphed akeley that i would meet him in brattleboro on the following wednesday september if that date were convenient for him .
in only one respect did i depart from his suggestions , and that concerned the choice of a train .
frankly , i did not feel like arriving in that haunted vermont region late at night ; so instead of accepting the train he chose i telephoned the station and devised another arrangement .
by rising early and taking the ( standard ) into boston , i could catch the for greenfield ; arriving there at noon .
this connected exactly with a train reaching brattleboro at a much more comfortable hour than for meeting akeley and riding with him into the , hills .
i mentioned this choice in my telegram , and was glad to learn in the reply which came toward evening that it had met with my prospective host endorsement .
his wire ran thus receipt of this message in direct response to one sent to akeley and necessarily delivered to his house from the townshend station either by official messenger or by a restored telephone service removed any lingering subconscious doubts i may have had about the authorship of the perplexing letter .
my relief was marked indeed , it was greater than i could account for at the time ; since all such doubts had been rather deeply buried .
but i slept soundly and long that night , and was eagerly busy with preparations during the ensuing two days .
on wednesday i started as agreed , taking with me a valise full of simple necessities and scientific data , including the hideous phonograph record , the kodak prints , and the entire file of akeley correspondence .
as requested , i had told no one where i was going ; for i could see that the matter demanded utmost privacy , even allowing for its most favourable turns .
the thought of actual mental contact with alien , outside entities was stupefying enough to my trained and somewhat prepared mind ; and this being so , what might one think of its effect on the vast masses of uninformed laymen ?
i do not know whether dread or adventurous expectancy was uppermost in me as i changed trains at boston and began the long westward run out of familiar regions into those i knew less thoroughly .
waltham concord ayer fitchburg gardner athol my train reached greenfield seven minutes late , but the northbound connecting express had been held .
transferring in haste , i felt a curious breathlessness as the cars rumbled on through the early afternoon sunlight into territories i had always read of but had never before visited .
i knew i was entering an altogether and more primitive new england than the mechanised , urbanised coastal and southern areas where all my life had been spent ; an unspoiled , ancestral new england without the foreigners and , and concrete roads , of the sections which modernity has touched .
there would be odd survivals of that continuous native life whose deep roots make it the one authentic outgrowth of the landscape the continuous native life which keeps alive strange ancient memories , and fertilises the soil for shadowy , marvellous , and beliefs .
now and then i saw the blue connecticut river gleaming in the sun , and after leaving northfield we crossed it .
ahead loomed green and cryptical hills , and when the conductor came around i learned that i was at last in vermont .
he told me to set my watch back an hour , since the northern hill country will have no dealings with daylight time schemes .
as i did so it seemed to me that i was likewise turning the calendar back a century .
the train kept close to the river , and across in new hampshire i could see the approaching slope of steep wantastiquet , about which singular old legends cluster .
then streets appeared on my left , and a green island showed in the stream on my right .
people rose and filed to the door , and i followed them .
the car stopped , and i alighted beneath the long of the brattleboro station .
looking over the line of waiting motors i hesitated a moment to see which one might turn out to be the akeley ford , but my identity was divined before i could take the initiative .
and yet it was clearly not akeley himself who advanced to meet me with an outstretched hand and a mellowly phrased query as to whether i was indeed albert wilmarth of arkham .
this man bore no resemblance to the bearded , grizzled akeley of the snapshot ; but was a younger and more urbane person , fashionably dressed , and wearing only a small , dark moustache .
his cultivated voice held an odd and almost disturbing hint of vague familiarity , though i could not definitely place it in my memory .
as i surveyed him i heard him explaining that he was a friend of my prospective host who had come down from townshend in his stead .
akeley , he declared , had suffered a sudden attack of some asthmatic trouble , and did not feel equal to making a trip in the outdoor air .
it was not serious , however , and there was to be no change in plans regarding my visit .
i could not make out just how much this noyes as he announced himself knew of akeley researches and discoveries , though it seemed to me that his casual manner stamped him as a comparative outsider .
remembering what a hermit akeley had been , i was a trifle surprised at the ready availability of such a friend ; but did not let my puzzlement deter me from entering the motor to which he gestured me .
it was not the small ancient car i had expected from akeley descriptions , but a large and immaculate specimen of recent pattern apparently noyes own , and bearing massachusetts license plates with the amusing sacred codfish device of that year .
my guide , i concluded , must be a summer transient in the townshend region .
noyes climbed into the car beside me and started it at once .
i was glad that he did not overflow with conversation , for some peculiar atmospheric tensity made me feel disinclined to talk .
the town seemed very attractive in the afternoon sunlight as we swept up an incline and turned to the right into the main street .
it drowsed like the older new england cities which one remembers from boyhood , and something in the collocation of roofs and steeples and chimneys and brick walls formed contours touching deep of ancestral emotion .
i could tell that i was at the gateway of a region through the of unbroken ; a region where old , strange things have had a chance to grow and linger because they have never been stirred up .
as we passed out of brattleboro my sense of constraint and foreboding increased , for a vague quality in the countryside with its towering , threatening , green and granite slopes hinted at obscure secrets and immemorial survivals which might or might not be hostile to mankind .
for a time our course followed a broad , shallow river which flowed down from unknown hills in the north , and i shivered when my companion told me it was the west river .
it was in this stream , i recalled from newspaper items , that one of the morbid crablike beings had been seen floating after the floods .
gradually the country around us grew wilder and more deserted .
archaic covered bridges lingered fearsomely out of the past in pockets of the hills , and the railway track paralleling the river seemed to exhale a nebulously visible air of desolation .
there were awesome sweeps of vivid valley where great cliffs rose , new england virgin granite showing grey and austere through the verdure that scaled the crests .
there were gorges where untamed streams leaped , bearing down toward the river the unimagined secrets of a thousand pathless peaks .
branching away now and then were narrow , roads that bored their way through solid , luxuriant masses of forest among whose primal trees whole armies of elemental spirits might well lurk .
as i saw these i thought of how akeley had been molested by unseen agencies on his drives along this very route , and did not wonder that such things could be .
the quaint , sightly village of newfane , reached in less than an hour , was our last link with that world which man can definitely call his own by virtue of conquest and complete occupancy .
after that we cast off all allegiance to immediate , tangible , and things , and entered a fantastic world of hushed unreality in which the narrow , road rose and fell and curved with an almost sentient and purposeful caprice amidst the tenantless green peaks and valleys .
except for the sound of the motor , and the faint stir of the few lonely farms we passed at infrequent intervals , the only thing that reached my ears was the gurgling , insidious trickle of strange waters from numberless hidden fountains in the shadowy woods .
the nearness and intimacy of the dwarfed , domed hills now became veritably .
their steepness and abruptness were even greater than i had imagined from hearsay , and suggested nothing in common with the prosaic objective world we know .
the dense , unvisited woods on those inaccessible slopes seemed to harbour alien and incredible things , and i felt that the very outline of the hills themselves held some strange and meaning , as if they were vast hieroglyphs left by a rumoured titan race whose glories live only in rare , deep dreams .
all the legends of the past , and all the stupefying imputations of henry akeley letters and exhibits , welled up in my memory to heighten the atmosphere of tension and growing menace .
the purpose of my visit , and the frightful abnormalities it postulated struck at me all at once with a chill sensation that nearly my ardour for strange delvings .
my guide must have noticed my disturbed attitude ; for as the road grew wilder and more irregular , and our motion slower and more jolting , his occasional pleasant comments expanded into a steadier flow of discourse .
he spoke of the beauty and weirdness of the country , and revealed some acquaintance with the folklore studies of my prospective host .
from his polite questions it was obvious that he knew i had come for a scientific purpose , and that i was bringing data of some importance ; but he gave no sign of appreciating the depth and awfulness of the knowledge which akeley had finally reached .
his manner was so cheerful , normal , and urbane that his remarks ought to have calmed and reassured me ; but oddly enough .
i felt only the more disturbed as we bumped and veered onward into the unknown wilderness of hills and woods .
at times it seemed as if he were pumping me to see what i knew of the monstrous secrets of the place , and with every fresh utterance that vague , teasing , baffling familiarity in his voice increased .
it was not an ordinary or healthy familiarity despite the thoroughly wholesome and cultivated nature of the voice .
i somehow linked it with forgotten nightmares , and felt that i might go mad if i recognised it .
if any good excuse had existed , i think i would have turned back from my visit .
as it was , i could not well do so and it occurred to me that a cool , scientific conversation with akeley himself after my arrival would help greatly to pull me together .
besides , there was a strangely calming element of cosmic beauty in the hypnotic landscape through which we climbed and plunged fantastically .
time had lost itself in the labyrinths behind , and around us stretched only the flowering waves of faery and the recaptured loveliness of vanished centuries the hoary groves , the untainted pastures edged with gay autumnal blossoms , and at vast intervals the small brown farmsteads nestling amidst huge trees beneath vertical precipices of fragrant brier and .
even the sunlight assumed a supernal glamour , as if some special atmosphere or exhalation mantled the whole region .
i had seen nothing like it before save in the magic vistas that sometimes form the backgrounds of italian primitives .
sodoma and leonardo conceived such expanses , but only in the distance , and through the vaultings of renaissance arcades .
we were now burrowing bodily through the midst of the picture , and i seemed to find in its necromancy a thing i had innately known or inherited and for which i had always been vainly searching .
suddenly , after rounding an obtuse angle at the top of a sharp ascent , the car came to a standstill .
on my left , across a lawn which stretched to the road and flaunted a border of whitewashed stones , rose a white , house of unusual size and elegance for the region , with a congenes of contiguous or barns , sheds , and windmill behind and to the right .
i recognised it at once from the snapshot i had received , and was not surprised to see the name of henry akeley on the mailbox near the road .
for some distance back of the house a level stretch of marshy and land extended , beyond which soared a steep , hillside ending in a jagged leafy crest .
this latter , i knew , was the summit of dark mountain , half way up which we must have climbed already .
alighting from the car and taking my valise , noyes asked me to wait while he went in and notified akeley of my advent .
he himself , he added , had important business elsewhere , and could not stop for more than a moment .
as he briskly walked up the path to the house i climbed out of the car myself , wishing to stretch my legs a little before settling down to a sedentary conversation .
my feeling of nervousness and tension had risen to a maximum again now that i was on the actual scene of the morbid beleaguering described so hauntingly in akeley letters , and i honestly dreaded the coming discussions which were to link me with such alien and forbidden worlds .
close contact with the utterly bizarre is often more terrifying than inspiring , and it did not cheer me to think that this very bit of dusty road was the place where those monstrous tracks and that foetid green ichor had been found after moonless nights of fear and death .
idly i noticed that none of akeley dogs seemed to be about .
had he sold them all as soon as the outer ones made peace with him ?
try as i might , i could not have the same confidence in the depth and sincerity of that peace which appeared in akeley final and queerly different letter .
after all , he was a man of much simplicity and with little worldly experience .
was there not , perhaps , some deep and sinister undercurrent beneath the surface of the new alliance ?
led by my thoughts , my eyes turned downward to the powdery road surface which had held such hideous testimonies .
the last few days had been dry , and tracks of all sorts cluttered the rutted , irregular highway despite the unfrequented nature of the district .
with a vague curiosity i began to trace the outline of some of the heterogeneous impressions , trying meanwhile to curb the flights of macabre fancy which the place and its memories suggested .
there was something menacing and uncomfortable in the funereal stillness , in the muffled , subtle trickle of distant brooks , and in the crowding green peaks and precipices that choked the narrow horizon .
and then an image shot into my consciousness which made those vague menaces and flights of fancy seem mild and insignificant indeed .
i have said that i was scanning the miscellaneous prints in the road with a kind of idle curiosity but all at once that curiosity was shockingly snuffed out by a sudden and paralysing gust of active terror .
for though the dust tracks were in general confused and overlapping , and unlikely to arrest any casual gaze , my restless vision had caught certain details near the spot where the path to the house joined the highway ; and had recognised beyond doubt or hope the frightful significance of those details .
it was not for nothing , alas , that i had pored for hours over the kodak views of the outer ones ' which akeley had sent .
too well did i know the marks of those loathsome nippers , and that hint of ambiguous direction which stamped the horrors as no creatures of this planet .
no chance had been left me for merciful mistake .
here , indeed , in objective form before my own eyes , and surely made not many hours ago , were at least three marks which stood out blasphemously among the surprising plethora of blurred footprints leading to and from the akeley farmhouse .
they were the hellish tracks of the living fungi from yuggoth .
i pulled myself together in time to stifle a scream .
after all , what more was there than i might have expected , assuming that i had really believed akeley letters ?
he had spoken of making peace with the things .
why , then , was it strange that some of them had visited his house ?
but the terror was stronger than the reassurance .
could any man be expected to look unmoved for the first time upon the of animate beings from outer depths of space ?
just then i saw noyes emerge from the door and approach with a brisk step .
i must , i reflected , keep command of myself , for the chances were that this genial friend knew nothing of akeley profoundest and most stupendous probings into the forbidden .
akeley , noyes hastened to inform me , was glad and ready to see me ; although his sudden attack of asthma would prevent him from being a very competent host for a day or two .
these spells hit him hard when they came , and were always accompanied by a debilitating fever and general weakness .
he never was good for much while they lasted had to talk in a whisper , and was very clumsy and feeble in getting about .
his feet and ankles swelled , too , so that he had to bandage them like a gouty old .
today he was in rather bad shape , so that i would have to attend very largely to my own needs ; but he was none the less eager for conversation .
i would find him in the study at the left of the front hall the room where the blinds were shut .
he had to keep the sunlight out when he was ill , for his eyes were very sensitive .
as noyes bade me adieu and rode off northward in his car i began to walk slowly toward the house .
the door had been left ajar for me ; but before approaching and entering i cast a searching glance around the whole place , trying to decide what had struck me as so intangibly queer about it .
the barns and sheds looked trimly prosaic enough , and i noticed akeley battered ford in its capacious , unguarded shelter .
then the secret of the queerness reached me .
it was the total silence .
ordinarily a farm is at least moderately murmurous from its various kinds of livestock , but here all signs of life were missing .
what of the hens and the dogs ?
the cows , of which akeley had said he possessed several , might conceivably be out to pasture , and the dogs might possibly have been sold ; but the absence of any trace of cackling or grunting was truly singular .
i did not pause long on the path , but resolutely entered the open house door and closed it behind me .
it had cost me a distinct psychological effort to do so , and now that i was shut inside i had a momentary longing for precipitate retreat .
not that the place was in the least sinister in visual suggestion ; on the contrary , i thought the graceful hallway very tasteful and wholesome , and admired the evident breeding of the man who had furnished it .
what made me wish to flee was something very attenuated and indefinable .
perhaps it was a certain odd odour which i thought i noticed though i well knew how common musty odours are in even the best of ancient farmhouses .
refusing to let these cloudy qualms overmaster me , i recalled noyes instructions and pushed open the , white door on my left .
the room beyond was darkened as i had known before ; and as i entered it i noticed that the queer odour was stronger there .
there likewise appeared to be some faint , rhythm or vibration in the air .
for a moment the closed blinds allowed me to see very little , but then a kind of apologetic hacking or whispering sound drew my attention to a great in the farther , darker corner of the room .
within its shadowy depths i saw the white blur of a man face and hands ; and in a moment i had crossed to greet the figure who had tried to speak .
dim though the light was , i perceived that this was indeed my host .
i had studied the kodak picture repeatedly , and there could be no mistake about this firm , face with the cropped , grizzled beard .
but as i looked again my recognition was mixed with sadness and anxiety ; for certainly , his face was that of a very sick man .
i felt that there must be something more than asthma behind that strained , rigid , immobile expression and unwinking glassy stare ; and realised how terribly the strain of his frightful experiences must have told on him .
was it not enough to break any human being even a younger man than this intrepid delver into the forbidden ?
the strange and sudden relief , i feared , had come too late to save him from something like a general breakdown .
there was a touch of the pitiful in the limp , lifeless way his lean hands rested in his lap .
he had on a loose , and was swathed around the head and high around the neck with a vivid yellow scarf or hood .
and then i saw that he was trying to talk in the same hacking whisper with which he had greeted me .
it was a hard whisper to catch at first , since the grey moustache concealed all movements of the lips , and something in its timbre disturbed me greatly ; but by concentrating my attention i could soon make out its purport surprisingly well .
the accent was by no means a rustic one , and the language was even more polished than correspondence had led me to expect .
wilmarth , i presume ?
you must pardon my not rising .
i am quite ill , as noyes must have told you ; but i could not resist having you come just the same .
you know what i wrote in my last letter there is so much to tell you tomorrow when i shall feel better .
i ca say how glad i am to see you in person after all our many letters .
you have the file with you , of course ?
and the kodak prints and records ?
noyes put your valise in the hall i suppose you saw it .
for tonight i fear you have to wait on yourself to a great extent .
your room is upstairs the one over this and you see the bathroom door open at the head of the staircase .
there a meal spread for you in the right through this door at your right which you can take whenever you feel like it .
i be a better host tomorrow but just now weakness leaves me helpless .
make yourself at home you might take out the letters and pictures and records and put them on the table here before you go upstairs with your bag .
it is here that we shall discuss them you can see my phonograph on that corner stand .
no , thanks there nothing you can do for me .
i know these spells of old .
just come back for a little quiet visiting before night , and then go to bed when you please .
i rest right here perhaps sleep here all night as i often do .
in the morning i be far better able to go into the things we must go into .
you realise , of course , the utterly stupendous nature of the matter before us .
to us , as to only a few men on this earth , there will be opened up gulfs of time and space and knowledge beyond anything within the conception of human science or philosophy .
do you know that einstein is wrong , and that certain objects and forces can move with a velocity greater than that of light ?
with proper aid i expect to go backward and forward in time , and actually see and feel the earth of remote past and future epochs .
you ca imagine the degree to which those beings have carried science .
there is nothing they ca do with the mind and body of living organisms .
i expect to visit other planets , and even other stars and galaxies .
the first trip will be to yuggoth , the nearest world fully peopled by the beings .
it is a strange dark orb at the very rim of our solar system unknown to earthly astronomers as yet .
but i must have written you about this .
at the proper time , you know , the beings there will direct toward us and cause it to be discovered or perhaps let one of their human allies give the scientists a hint .
there are mighty cities on yuggoth great tiers of terraced towers built of black stone like the specimen i tried to send you .
that came from yuggoth .
the sun shines there no brighter than a star , but the beings need no light .
they have other subtler senses , and put no windows in their great houses and temples .
light even hurts and hampers and confuses them , for it does not exist at all in the black cosmos outside time and space where they came from originally .
to visit yuggoth would drive any weak man mad yet i am going there .
the black rivers of pitch that flow under those mysterious cyclopean bridges things built by some elder race extinct and forgotten before the beings came to yuggoth from the ultimate voids ought to be enough to make any man a dante or poe if he can keep sane long enough to tell what he has seen .
but remember that dark world of fungoid gardens and windowless cities is really terrible .
it is only to us that it would seem so .
probably this world seemed just as terrible to the beings when they first explored it in the primal age .
you know they were here long before the fabulous epoch of cthulhu was over , and remember all about sunken when it was above the waters .
they been inside the earth , too there are openings which human beings know nothing of some of them in these very vermont hills and great worlds of unknown life down there ; , yoth , and black , lightless .
it from that frightful tsathoggua came you know , the amorphous , mentioned in the pnakotic manuscripts and the necronomicon and the commoriom preserved by the atlantean .
but we will talk of all this later on .
it must be four or five by this time .
better bring the stuff from your bag , take a bite , and then come back for a comfortable chat .
very slowly i turned and began to obey my host ; fetching my valise , extracting and depositing the desired articles , and finally ascending to the room designated as mine .
with the memory of that roadside fresh in my mind , akeley whispered paragraphs had affected me queerly ; and the hints of familiarity with this unknown world of fungous life forbidden yuggoth made my flesh creep more than i cared to own .
i was tremendously sorry about akeley illness , but had to confess that his hoarse whisper had a hateful as well as pitiful quality .
if only he would gloat so about yuggoth and its black secrets !
my room proved a very pleasant and one , devoid alike of the musty odour and disturbing sense of vibration ; and after leaving my valise there i descended again to greet akeley and take the lunch he had set out for me .
the was just beyond the study , and i saw that a kitchen extended still farther in the same direction .
on the an ample array of sandwiches , cake , and cheese awaited me , and a beside a cup and saucer testified that hot coffee had not been forgotten .
after a meal i poured myself a liberal cup of coffee , but found that the culinary standard had suffered a lapse in this one detail .
my first spoonful revealed a faintly unpleasant acrid taste , so that i did not take more .
throughout the lunch i thought of akeley sitting silently in the great chair in the darkened next room .
once i went in to beg him to share the repast , but he whispered that he could eat nothing as yet .
later on , just before he slept , he would take some malted milk all he ought to have that day .
after lunch i insisted on clearing the dishes away and washing them in the kitchen sink incidentally emptying the coffee which i had not been able to appreciate .
then returning to the darkened study i drew up a chair near my host corner and prepared for such conversation as he might feel inclined to conduct .
the letters , pictures , and record were still on the large , but for the nonce we did not have to draw upon them .
before long i forgot even the bizarre odour and curious suggestions of vibration .
i have said that there were things in some of akeley letters especially the second and most voluminous one which i would not dare to quote or even form into words on paper .
this hesitancy applies with still greater force to the things i heard whispered that evening in the darkened room among the lonely hills .
of the extent of the cosmic horrors unfolded by that raucous voice i can not even hint .
he had known hideous things before , but what he had learned since making his pact with the outside things was almost too much for sanity to bear .
even now i absolutely refused to believe what he implied about the constitution of ultimate infinity , the juxtaposition of dimensions , and the frightful position of our known cosmos of space and time in the unending chain of linked which makes up the immediate of curves , angles , and material and electronic organisation .
never was a sane man more dangerously close to the arcana of basic entity never was an organic brain nearer to utter annihilation in the chaos that transcends form and force and symmetry .
i learned whence cthulhu first came , and why half the great temporary stars of history had flared forth .
i guessed from hints which made even my informant pause timidly the secret behind the magellanic clouds and globular nebulae , and the black truth veiled by the immemorial allegory of tao .
the nature of the doels was plainly revealed , and i was told the essence ( though not the source ) of the hounds of tindalos .
the legend of yig , father of serpents , remained figurative no longer , and i started with loathing when told of the monstrous nuclear chaos beyond angled space which the necronomicon had mercifully cloaked under the name of azathoth .
it was shocking to have the foulest nightmares of secret myth cleared up in concrete terms whose stark , morbid hatefulness exceeded the boldest hints of ancient and mediaeval mystics .
ineluctably i was led to believe that the first whisperers of these accursed tales must have had discourse with akeley outer ones , and perhaps have visited outer cosmic realms as akeley now proposed visiting them .
i was told of the black stone and what it implied , and was glad that it had not reached me .
my guesses about those hieroglyphics had been all too correct !
and yet akeley now seemed reconciled to the whole fiendish system he had stumbled upon ; reconciled and eager to probe farther into the monstrous abyss .
i wondered what beings he had talked with since his last letter to me , and whether many of them had been as human as that first emissary he had mentioned .
the tension in my head grew insufferable , and i built up all sorts of wild theories about that queer , persistent odour and those insidious hints of vibration in the darkened room .
night was falling now , and as i recalled what akeley had written me about those earlier nights i shuddered to think there would be no moon .
nor did i like the way the farmhouse nestled in the lee of that colossal forested slope leading up to dark mountain unvisited crest .
with akeley permission i lighted a small oil lamp , turned it low , and set it on a distant bookcase beside the ghostly bust of milton ; but afterward i was sorry i had done so , for it made my host strained , immobile face and listless hands look damnably abnormal and corpselike .
he seemed of motion , though i saw him nod stiffly once in awhile .
after what he had told , i could scarcely imagine what profounder secrets he was saving for the morrow ; but at last it developed that his trip to yuggoth and beyond and my own possible participation in it was to be the next day topic .
he must have been amused by the start of horror i gave at hearing a cosmic voyage on my part proposed , for his head wabbled violently when i showed my fear .
subsequently he spoke very gently of how human beings might accomplish and several times had accomplished the seemingly impossible flight across the interstellar void .
it seemed that complete human bodies did not indeed make the trip , but that the prodigious surgical , biological , chemical , and mechanical skill of the outer ones had found a way to convey human brains without their concomitant physical structure .
there was a harmless way to extract a brain , and a way to keep the organic residue alive during its absence .
the bare , compact cerebral matter was then immersed in an occasionally replenished fluid within an cylinder of a metal mined in yuggoth , certain electrodes reaching through and connecting at will with elaborate instruments capable of duplicating the three vital faculties of sight , hearing , and speech .
for the winged to carry the intact through space was an easy matter .
then , on every planet covered by their civilisation , they would find plenty of adjustable capable of being connected with the encased brains ; so that after a little fitting these travelling intelligences could be given a full sensory and articulate life albeit a bodiless and mechanical one at each stage of their journeying through and beyond the continuum .
it was as simple as carrying a phonograph record about and playing it wherever a phonograph of corresponding make exists .
of its success there could be no question .
akeley was not afraid .
had it not been brilliantly accomplished again and again ?
for the first time one of the inert , wasted hands raised itself and pointed stiffly to a high shelf on the farther side of the room .
there , in a neat row , stood more than a dozen cylinders of a metal i had never seen before cylinders about a foot high and somewhat less in diameter , with three curious sockets set in an isosceles triangle over the front convex surface of each .
one of them was linked at two of the sockets to a pair of machines that stood in the background .
of their purport i did not need to be told , and i shivered as with ague .
then i saw the hand point to a much nearer corner where some intricate instruments with attached cords and plugs , several of them much like the two devices on the shelf behind the cylinders , were huddled together .
there are four kinds of instruments here , wilmarth , whispered the voice .
four kinds three faculties each makes twelve pieces in all .
you see there are four different sorts of beings represented in those cylinders up there .
three humans , six fungoid beings who ca navigate space corporeally , two beings from neptune ( god !
if you could see the body this type has on its own planet !
) , and the rest entities from the central caverns of an especially interesting dark star beyond the galaxy .
in the principal outpost inside round hill you now and then find more cylinders and machines cylinders of brains with different senses from any we know allies and explorers from the uttermost outside and special machines for giving them impressions and expression in the several ways suited at once to them and to the comprehensions of different types of listeners .
round hill , like most of the beings ' main outposts all through the various universes , is a very cosmopolitan place .
of course , only the more common types have been lent to me for experiment .
here take the three machines i point to and set them on the table .
that tall one with the two glass lenses in front then the box with the vacuum tubes and and now the one with the metal disc on top .
now for the cylinder with the label ' ' pasted on it .
just stand in that windsor chair to reach the shelf .
heavy ?
never mind !
be sure of the number .
do bother that fresh , shiny cylinder joined to the two testing instruments the one with my name on it .
set on the table near where you put the machines and see that the dial switch on all three machines is jammed over to the extreme left .
now connect the cord of the lens machine with the upper socket on the cylinder there !
join the tube machine to the lower socket , and the disc apparatus to the outer socket .
now move all the dial switches on the machine over to the extreme right first the lens one , then the disc one , and then the tube one .
that right .
i might as well tell you that this is a human being just like any of us .
i give you a taste of some of the others tomorrow .
to this day i do not know why i obeyed those whispers so slavishly , or whether i thought akeley was mad or sane .
after what had gone before , i ought to have been prepared for anything ; but this mechanical mummery seemed so like the typical vagaries of crazed inventors and scientists that it struck a chord of doubt which even the preceding discourse had not excited .
what the whisperer implied was beyond all human belief yet were not the other things still farther beyond , and less preposterous only because of their remoteness from tangible concrete proof ?
as my mind reeled amidst this chaos , i became conscious of a mixed grating and whirring from all three of the machines lately linked to the cylinder a grating and whirring which soon subsided into a virtual noiselessness .
what was about to happen ?
was i to hear a voice ?
and if so , what proof would i have that it was not some cleverly concocted radio device talked into by a concealed but closely watched speaker ?
even now i am unwilling to swear just what i heard , or just what phenomenon really took place before me .
but something certainly seemed to take place .
to be brief and plain , the machine with the tubes and began to speak , and with a point and intelligence which left no doubt that the speaker was actually present and observing us .
the voice was loud , metallic , lifeless , and plainly mechanical in every detail of its production .
it was incapable of inflection or expressiveness , but scraped and rattled on with a deadly precision and deliberation .
wilmarth , it said , i hope i do not startle you .
i am a human being like yourself , though my body is now resting safely under proper vitalising treatment inside round hill , about a mile and a half east of here .
i myself am here with you my brain is in that cylinder and i see , hear , and speak through these electronic vibrators .
in a week i am going across the void as i have been many times before , and i expect to have the pleasure of akeley company .
i wish i might have yours as well ; for i know you by sight and reputation , and have kept close track of your correspondence with our friend .
i am , of course , one of the men who have become allied with the outside beings visiting our planet .
i met them first in the himalayas , and have helped them in various ways .
in return they have given me experiences such as few men have ever had .
do you realise what it means when i say i have been on different celestial bodies planets , dark stars , and less definable objects including eight outside our galaxy and two outside the curved cosmos of space and time ?
all this has not harmed me in the least .
my brain has been removed from my body by fissions so adroit that it would be crude to call the operation surgery .
the visiting beings have methods which make these extractions easy and almost normal and one body never ages when the brain is out of it .
the brain , i may add , is virtually immortal with its mechanical faculties and a limited nourishment supplied by occasional changes of the preserving fluid .
altogether , i hope most heartily that you will decide to come with akeley and me .
the visitors are eager to know men of knowledge like yourself , and to show them the great abysses that most of us have had to dream about in fanciful ignorance .
it may seem strange at first to meet them , but i know you will be above minding that .
i think noyes will go along , too the man who doubtless brought you up here in his car .
he has been one of us for years i suppose you recognised his voice as one of those on the record akeley sent you .
at my violent start the speaker paused a moment before concluding .
so wilmarth , i will leave the matter to you ; merely adding that a man with your love of strangeness and folklore ought never to miss such a chance as this .
there is nothing to fear .
all transitions are painless ; and there is much to enjoy in a wholly mechanised state of sensation .
when the electrodes are disconnected , one merely drops off into a sleep of especially vivid and fantastic dreams .
and now , if you do mind , we might adjourn our session till tomorrow .
good night just turn all the switches back to the left ; never mind the exact order , though you might let the lens machine be last .
good night , akeley treat our guest well !
ready now with those switches ?
that was all .
i obeyed mechanically and shut off all three switches , though dazed with doubt of everything that had occurred .
my head was still reeling as i heard akeley whispering voice telling me that i might leave all the apparatus on the table just as it was .
he did not essay any comment on what had happened , and indeed no comment could have conveyed much to my burdened faculties .
i heard him telling me i could take the lamp to use in my room , and deduced that he wished to rest alone in the dark .
it was surely time he rested , for his discourse of the afternoon and evening had been such as to exhaust even a vigorous man .
still dazed , i bade my host good night and went upstairs with the lamp , although i had an excellent pocket flashlight with me .
i was glad to be out of that downstairs study with the queer odour and vague suggestions of vibration , yet could not of course escape a hideous sense of dread and peril and cosmic abnormality as i thought of the place i was in and the forces i was meeting .
the wild , lonely region , the black , mysteriously forested slope towering so close behind the house ; the footprint in the road , the sick , motionless whisperer in the dark , the hellish cylinders and machines , and above all the invitations to strange surgery and stranger voyagings these things , all so new and in such sudden succession , rushed in on me with a cumulative force which sapped my will and almost undermined my physical strength .
to discover that my guide noyes was the human celebrant in that monstrous bygone on the phonograph record was a particular shock , though i had previously sensed a dim , repellent familiarity in his voice .
another special shock came from my own attitude toward my host whenever i paused to analyse it ; for much as i had instinctively liked akeley as revealed in his correspondence , i now found that he filled me with a distinct repulsion .
his illness ought to have excited my pity ; but instead , it gave me a kind of shudder .
he was so rigid and inert and corpselike and that incessant whispering was so hateful and unhuman !
it occurred to me that this whispering was different from anything else of the kind i had ever heard ; that , despite the curious motionlessness of the speaker lips , it had a latent strength and remarkable for the wheezing of an asthmatic .
i had been able to understand the speaker when wholly across the room , and once or twice it had seemed to me that the faint but penetrant sounds represented not so much weakness as deliberate repression for what reason i could not guess .
from the first i had felt a disturbing quality in their timbre .
now , when i tried to weigh the matter , i thought i could trace this impression to a kind of subconscious familiarity like that which had made noyes voice so hazily ominous .
but when or where i had encountered the thing it hinted at , was more than i could tell .
one thing was certain i would not spend another night here .
my scientific zeal had vanished amidst fear and loathing , and i felt nothing now but a wish to escape from this net of morbidity and unnatural revelation .
i knew enough now .
it must indeed be true that strange cosmic linkages do exist but such things are surely not meant for normal human beings to meddle with .
blasphemous influences seemed to surround me and press chokingly upon my senses .
sleep , i decided , would be out of the question ; so i merely extinguished the lamp and threw myself on the bed fully dressed .
no doubt it was absurd , but i kept ready for some unknown emergency ; gripping in my right hand the revolver i had brought along , and holding the pocket flashlight in my left .
not a sound came from below , and i could imagine how my host was sitting there with cadaverous stiffness in the dark .
somewhere i heard a clock ticking , and was vaguely grateful for the normality of the sound .
it reminded me , though , of another thing about the region which disturbed me the total absence of animal life .
there were certainly no farm beasts about , and now i realised that even the accustomed of wild living things were absent .
except for the sinister trickle of distant unseen waters , that stillness was anomalous interplanetary and i wondered what , intangible blight could be hanging over the region .
i recalled from old legends that dogs and other beasts had always hated the outer ones , and thought of what those tracks in the road might mean .
do not ask me how long my unexpected lapse into slumber lasted , or how much of what ensued was sheer dream .
if i tell you that i awakened at a certain time , and heard and saw certain things , you will merely answer that i did not wake then ; and that everything was a dream until the moment when i rushed out of the house , stumbled to the shed where i had seen the old ford , and seized that ancient vehicle for a mad , aimless race over the haunted hills which at last landed me after hours of jolting and winding through labyrinths in a village which turned out to be townshend .
you will also , of course , discount everything else in my report ; and declare that all the pictures , , sounds , and kindred evidences were bits of pure deception practiced on me by the missing henry akeley .
you will even hint that he conspired with other eccentrics to carry out a silly and elaborate hoax that he had the express shipment removed at keene , and that he had noyes make that terrifying wax record .
it is odd , though , that noyes has not ever yet been identified ; that he was unknown at any of the villages near akeley place , though he must have been frequently in the region .
i wish i had stopped to memorize the of his car or perhaps it is better after all that i did not .
for i , despite all you can say , and despite all i sometimes try to say to myself , know that loathsome outside influences must be lurking there in the hills and that , those influences have spies and emissaries in the world of men .
to keep as far as possible from such influences and such emissaries is all that i ask of life in future .
when my frantic story sent a sheriff posse out to the farmhouse , akeley was gone without leaving a trace .
his loose dressing gown , yellow scarf , and lay on the study floor near his corner .
, and it could not be decided whether any of his other apparel had vanished with him .
the dogs and livestock were indeed missing , and there were some curious both on the house exterior and on some of the walls within ; but beyond this nothing unusual could be detected .
no cylinders or machines , none of the evidences i had brought in my valise , no queer odour or , no in the road , and none of the problematical things i glimpsed at the very last .
i stayed a week in brattleboro after my escape , making inquiries among people of every kind who had known akeley ; and the results convince me that the matter is no figment of dream or delusion . '
akeley queer purchase of dogs and ammunition and chemicals , and the cutting of his telephone wires , are matters of record ; while all who knew him including his son in california concede that his occasional remarks on strange studies had a certain consistency .
solid citizens believe he was mad , and unhesitatingly pronounce all reported evidences mere hoaxes devised with insane cunning and perhaps abetted by eccentric associates ; but the lowlier country folk sustain his statements in every detail .
he had showed some of these rustics his photographs and black stone , and had played the hideous record for them ; and they all said the footprints and buzzing voice were like those described in ancestral legends .
they said , too , that suspicious sights and sounds had been noticed increasingly around akeley house after he found the black stone , and that the place was now avoided by everybody except the mail man and other casual , people .
dark mountain and round hill were both notoriously haunted spots , and i could find no one who had ever closely explored either .
occasional disappearances of natives throughout the district history were well attested , and these now included the walter brown , whom akeley letters had mentioned .
i even came upon one farmer who thought he had personally glimpsed one of the queer bodies at in the swollen west river , but his tale was too confused to be really valuable .
when i left brattleboro i resolved never to go back to vermont , and i feel quite certain i shall keep my resolution .
those wild hills are surely the outpost of a frightful cosmic race as i doubt all the less since reading that a new ninth planet has been glimpsed beyond neptune , just as those influences had said it would be glimpsed .
astronomers , with a hideous appropriateness they little suspect , have named this thing pluto .
i feel , beyond question , that it is nothing less than nighted yuggoth and i shiver when i try to figure out the real reason why its monstrous denizens wish it to be known in this way at this especial time .
i vainly try to assure myself that these daemoniac creatures are not gradually leading up to some new policy hurtful to the earth and its normal inhabitants .
but i have still to tell of the ending of that terrible night in the farmhouse .
as i have said , i did finally drop into a troubled doze ; a doze filled with bits of dream which involved monstrous .
just what awaked me i can not yet say , but that i did indeed awake at this given point i feel very certain .
my first confused impression was of stealthily creaking in the hall outside my door , and of a clumsy , muffled fumbling at the latch .
this , however , ceased almost at once ; so that my really clear impressions begin with the voices heard from the study below .
there seemed to be several speakers , and i judged that they were controversially engaged .
by the time i had listened a few seconds i was broad awake , for the nature of the voices was such as to make all thought of sleep ridiculous .
the tones were curiously varied , and no one who had listened to that accursed phonograph record could harbour any doubts about the nature of at least two of them .
hideous though the idea was , i knew that i was under the same roof with nameless things from abysmal space ; for those two voices were unmistakably the blasphemous buzzings which the outside beings used in their communication with men .
the two were individually different different in pitch , accent , and tempo but they were both of the same damnable general kind .
a third voice was indubitably that of a mechanical connected with one of the detached brains in the cylinders .
there was as little doubt about that as about the buzzings ; for the loud , metallic , lifeless voice of the previous evening , with its inflectionless , expressionless scraping and rattling , and its impersonal precision and deliberation , had been utterly unforgettable .
for a time i did not pause to question whether the intelligence behind the scraping was the identical one which had formerly talked to me ; but shortly afterward i reflected that any brain would emit vocal sounds of the same quality if linked to the same mechanical ; the only possible differences being in language , rhythm , speed , and pronunciation .
to complete the eldritch colloquy there were two actually human voices one the crude speech of an unknown and evidently rustic man , and the other the suave bostonian tones of my erstwhile guide noyes .
as i tried to catch the words which the floor so bafflingly intercepted , i was also conscious of a great deal of stirring and scratching and shuffling in the room below ; so that i could not escape the impression that it was full of living beings many more than the few whose speech i could single out .
the exact nature of this stirring is extremely hard to describe , for very few good bases of comparison exist .
objects seemed now and then to move across the room like conscious entities ; the sound of their footfalls having something about it like a loose , clattering as of the contact of surfaces of horn or hard rubber .
it was , to use a more concrete but less accurate comparison , as if people with loose , splintery wooden shoes were shambling and rattling about on the polished board floor .
of the nature and appearance of those responsible for the sounds , i did not care to speculate .
before long i saw that it would be impossible to distinguish any connected discourse .
isolated words including the names of akeley and myself now and then floated up , especially when uttered by the mechanical ; but their true significance was lost for want of continuous context .
today i refuse to form any definite deductions from them , and even their frightful effect on me was one of suggestion rather than of revelation .
a terrible and abnormal conclave , i felt certain , was assembled below me ; but for what shocking deliberations i could not tell .
it was curious how this unquestioned sense of the malign and the blasphemous pervaded me despite akeley assurances of the outsider friendliness .
with patient listening i began to distinguish clearly between voices , even though i could not grasp much of what any of the voices said .
i seemed to catch certain typical emotions behind some of the speakers .
one of the buzzing voices , for example , held an unmistakable note of authority ; whilst the mechanical voice , notwithstanding its artificial loudness and regularity , seemed to be in a position of subordination and pleading .
noyes tones exuded a kind of conciliatory atmosphere .
the others i could make no attempt to interpret .
i did not hear the familiar whisper of akeley , but well knew that such a sound could never penetrate the solid flooring of my room .
i will try to set down some of the few disjointed words and other sounds i caught , labelling the speakers of the words as best i know how .
it was from the that i first picked up a few recognisable phrases .
( the ) brought it on myself sent back the letters and the record end on it taken in seeing and hearing damn you impersonal force , after all fresh , shiny cylinder great god ( first buzzing voice ) time we stopped small and human akeley brain saying ( second buzzing voice ) nyarlathotep wilmarth records and letters cheap imposture ( noyes ) ( an unpronounceable word or name , possibly ) harmless peace couple of weeks theatrical told you that before ( first buzzing voice ) no reason original plan effects noyes can watch round hill fresh cylinder noyes car ( noyes ) well all yours down here rest place ( several voices at once in indistinguishable speech ) ( many footsteps , including the peculiar loose stirring or clattering ) ( a curious sort of flapping sound ) ( the sound of an automobile starting and receding ) ( silence ) that is the substance of what my ears brought me as i lay rigid upon that strange upstairs bed in the haunted farmhouse among the daemoniac hills lay there fully dressed , with a revolver clenched in my right hand and a pocket flashlight gripped in my left .
i became , as i have said , broad awake ; but a kind of obscure paralysis nevertheless kept me inert till long after the last echoes of the sounds had died away .
i heard the wooden , deliberate ticking of the ancient connecticut clock somewhere far below , and at last made out the irregular snoring of a sleeper .
akeley must have dozed off after the strange session , and i could well believe that he needed to do so .
just what to think or what to do was more than i could decide after all , what had i heard beyond things which previous information might have led me to expect ?
had i not known that the nameless outsiders were now freely admitted to the farmhouse ?
no doubt akeley had been surprised by an unexpected visit from them .
yet something in that fragmentary discourse had chilled me immeasurably , raised the most grotesque and horrible doubts , and made me wish fervently that i might wake up and prove everything a dream .
i think my subconscious mind must have caught something which my consciousness has not yet recognised .
but what of akeley ?
was he not my friend , and would he not have protested if any harm were meant me ?
the peaceful snoring below seemed to cast ridicule on all my suddenly intensified fears .
was it possible that akeley had been imposed upon and used as a lure to draw me into the hills with the letters and pictures and phonograph record ?
did those beings mean to engulf us both in a common destruction because we had come to know too much ?
again i thought of the abruptness and unnaturalness of that change in the situation which must have occurred between akeley penultimate and final letters .
something , my instinct told me , was terribly wrong .
all was not as it seemed .
that acrid coffee which i refused had there not been an attempt by some hidden , unknown entity to drug it ?
i must talk to akeley at once , and restore his sense of proportion .
they had hypnotised him with their promises of cosmic revelations , but now he must listen to reason .
we must get out of this before it would be too late .
if he lacked the will power to make the break for liberty .
i would supply it .
or if i could not persuade him to go , i could at least go myself .
surely he would let me take his ford and leave it in a garage in brattleboro .
i had noticed it in the shed the door being left unlocked and open now that peril was deemed past and i believed there was a good chance of its being ready for instant use .
that momentary dislike of akeley which i had felt during and after the evening conversation was all gone now .
he was in a position much like my own , and we must stick together .
knowing his indisposed condition , i hated to wake him at this juncture , but i knew that i must .
i could not stay in this place till morning as matters stood .
at last i felt able to act , and stretched myself vigorously to regain command of my muscles .
arising with a caution more impulsive than deliberate , i found and donned my hat , took my valise , and started downstairs with the flashlight aid .
in my nervousness i kept the revolver clutched in my right hand , being able to take care of both valise and flashlight with my left .
why i exerted these precautions i do not really know , since i was even then on my way to awaken the only other occupant of the house .
as i down the creaking stairs to the lower hall i could hear the sleeper more plainly , and noticed that he must be in the room on my left the i had not entered .
on my right was the gaping blackness of the study in which i had heard the voices .
pushing open the unlatched door of the i traced a path with the flashlight toward the source of the snoring , and finally turned the beams on the sleeper face .
but in the next second i hastily turned them away and commenced a catlike retreat to the hall , my caution this time springing from reason as well as from instinct .
for the sleeper on the couch was not akeley at all , but my quondam guide noyes .
just what the real situation was , i could not guess ; but common sense told me that the safest thing was to find out as much as possible before arousing anybody .
regaining the hall , i silently closed and latched the door after me ; thereby lessening the chances of awakening noyes .
i now cautiously entered the dark study , where i expected to find akeley , whether asleep or awake , in the great corner chair which was evidently his favorite .
as i advanced , the beams of my flashlight caught the great , revealing one of the hellish cylinders with sight and hearing machines attached , and with a speech machine standing close by , ready to be connected at any moment .
this , i reflected , must be the encased brain i had heard talking during the frightful conference ; and for a second i had a perverse impulse to attach the speech machine and see what it would say .
it must , i thought , be conscious of my presence even now ; since the sight and hearing attachments could not fail to disclose the rays of my flashlight and the faint creaking of the floor beneath my feet .
but in the end i did not dare meddle with the thing .
i idly saw that it was the fresh shiny cylinder with akeley name on it , which i had noticed on the shelf earlier in the evening and which my host had told me not to bother .
looking back at that moment , i can only regret my timidity and wish that i had boldly caused the apparatus to speak .
god knows what mysteries and horrible doubts and questions of identity it might have cleared up !
but then , it may be merciful that i let it alone .
from the table i turned my flashlight to the corner where i thought akeley was , but found to my perplexity that the great was empty of any human occupant asleep or awake .
from the seat to the floor there trailed voluminously the familiar old , and near it on the floor lay the yellow scarf and the huge i had thought so odd .
as i hesitated , striving to conjecture where akeley might be , and why he had so suddenly discarded his necessary garments , i observed that the queer odour and sense of vibration were no longer in the room .
what had been their cause ?
curiously it occurred to me that i had noticed them only in akeley vicinity .
they had been strongest where he sat , and wholly absent except in the room with him or just outside the doors of that room .
i paused , letting the flashlight wander about the dark study and racking my brain for explanations of the turn affairs had taken .
would to heaven i had quietly left the place before allowing that light to rest again on the vacant chair .
as it turned out , i did not leave quietly ; but with a muffled shriek which must have disturbed , though it did not quite awake , the sleeping sentinel across the hall .
that shriek , and noyes snore , are the last sounds i ever heard in that farmhouse beneath the crest of haunted mountain that focus of transcosmic horror amidst the lonely green hills and brooks of a spectral rustic land .
it is a wonder that i did not drop flashlight , valise , and revolver in my wild scramble , but somehow i failed to lose any of these .
i actually managed to get out of that room and that house without making any further noise , to drag myself and my belongings safely into the old ford in the shed , and to set that archaic vehicle in motion toward some unknown point of safety in the black , moonless night .
the ride that followed was a piece of delirium out of poe or rimbaud or the drawings of dore , but finally i reached townshend .
that is all .
if my sanity is still unshaken , i am lucky .
sometimes i fear what the years will bring , especially since that new planet pluto has been so curiously discovered .
as i have implied , i let my flashlight return to the vacant after its circuit of the room ; then noticing for the first time the presence of certain objects in the seat , made inconspicuous by the adjacent loose folds of the empty .
these are the objects , three in number , which the investigators did not find when they came later on .
as i said at the outset , there was nothing of actual visual horror about them .
the trouble was in what they led one to infer .
even now i have my moments of moments in which i the scepticism of those who attribute my whole experience to dream and nerves and delusion .
the three things were damnably clever constructions of their kind , and were furnished with ingenious metallic clamps to attach them to organic developments of which i dare not form any conjecture .
i hope devoutly hope that they were the waxen products of a master artist , despite what my inmost fears tell me .
great god !
that whisperer in darkness with its morbid odour and vibrations !
sorcerer , emissary , changeling , outsider that hideous repressed buzzing and all the time in that fresh , shiny cylinder on the shelf poor devil prodigious surgical , biological , chemical , and mechanical skill for the things in the chair , perfect to the last , subtle detail of microscopic resemblance or identity were the face and hands of henry wentworth akeley .
whether the dreams brought on the fever or the fever brought on the dreams walter gilman did not know .
behind everything crouched the brooding , festering horror of the ancient town , and of the mouldy , unhallowed garret gable where he wrote and studied and wrestled with figures and formulae when he was not tossing on the meagre iron bed .
his ears were growing sensitive to a preternatural and intolerable degree , and he had long ago stopped the cheap mantel clock whose ticking had come to seem like a thunder of artillery .
at night the subtle stirring of the black city outside , the sinister scurrying of rats in the wormy partitions , and the creaking of hidden timbers in the centuried house , were enough to give him a sense of strident pandemonium .
the darkness always teemed with unexplained sound and yet he sometimes shook with fear lest the noises he heard should subside and allow him to hear certain other fainter noises which he suspected were lurking behind them .
he was in the changeless , city of arkham , with its clustering gambrel roofs that sway and sag over attics where witches hid from the king men in the dark , olden years of the province .
nor was any spot in that city more steeped in macabre memory than the gable room which harboured him for it was this house and this room which had likewise harboured old keziah mason , whose flight from salem gaol at the last no one was ever able to explain .
that was in the gaoler had gone mad and babbled of a small furry thing which scuttled out of keziah cell , and not even cotton mather could explain the curves and angles smeared on the grey stone walls with some red , sticky fluid .
possibly gilman ought not to have studied so hard .
calculus and quantum physics are enough to stretch any brain , and when one mixes them with folklore , and tries to trace a strange background of reality behind the ghoulish hints of the gothic tales and the wild whispers of the , one can hardly expect to be wholly free from mental tension .
gilman came from haverhill , but it was only after he had entered college in arkham that he began to connect his mathematics with the fantastic legends of elder magic .
something in the air of the hoary town worked obscurely on his imagination .
the professors at miskatonic had urged him to slacken up , and had voluntarily cut down his course at several points .
moreover , they had stopped him from consulting the dubious old books on forbidden secrets that were kept under lock and key in a vault at the university library .
but all these precautions came late in the day , so that gilman had some terrible hints from the dreaded necronomicon of abdul alhazred , the fragmentary book of eibon , and the suppressed unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt to correlate with his abstract formulae on the properties of space and the linkage of dimensions known and unknown .
he knew his room was in the old that , indeed , was why he had taken it .
there was much in the essex county records about keziah mason trial , and what she had admitted under pressure to the court of oyer and terminer had fascinated gilman beyond all reason .
she had told judge hathorne of lines and curves that could be made to point out directions leading through the walls of space to other spaces beyond , and had implied that such lines and curves were frequently used at certain midnight meetings in the dark valley of the white stone beyond meadow hill and on the unpeopled island in the river .
she had spoken also of the black man , of her oath , and of her new secret name of nahab .
then she had drawn those devices on the walls of her cell and vanished .
gilman believed strange things about keziah , and had felt a queer thrill on learning that her dwelling was still standing after more than two hundred and years .
when he heard the hushed arkham whispers about keziah persistent presence in the old house and the narrow streets , about the irregular human left on certain sleepers in that and other houses , about the childish cries heard near , and hallowmass , about the stench often noted in the old house attic just after those dreaded seasons , and about the small , furry , thing which haunted the mouldering structure and the town and nuzzled people curiously in the black hours before dawn , he resolved to live in the place at any cost .
a room was easy to secure , for the house was unpopular , hard to rent , and long given over to cheap lodgings .
gilman could not have told what he expected to find there , but he knew he wanted to be in the building where some circumstance had more or less suddenly given a mediocre old woman of the seventeenth century an insight into mathematical depths perhaps beyond the utmost modern delvings of planck , heisenberg , einstein , and de sitter .
he studied the timber and plaster walls for traces of cryptic designs at every accessible spot where the paper had peeled , and within a week managed to get the eastern attic room where keziah was held to have practised her spells .
it had been vacant from the first for no one had ever been willing to stay there long but the polish landlord had grown wary about renting it .
yet nothing whatever happened to gilman till about the time of the fever .
no ghostly keziah flitted through the sombre halls and chambers , no small furry thing crept into his dismal eyrie to nuzzle him , and no record of the witch incantations rewarded his constant search .
sometimes he would take walks through shadowy tangles of unpaved lanes where eldritch brown houses of unknown age leaned and tottered and leered mockingly through narrow , windows .
here he knew strange things had happened once , and there was a faint suggestion behind the surface that everything of that monstrous past might not at least in the darkest , narrowest , and most intricately crooked alleys have utterly perished .
he also rowed out twice to the island in the river , and made a sketch of the singular angles described by the rows of grey standing stones whose origin was so obscure and immemorial .
gilman room was of good size but queerly irregular shape ; the north wall slanting perceptibly inward from the outer to the inner end , while the low ceiling slanted gently downward in the same direction .
aside from an obvious and the signs of other ones , there was no access nor any appearance of a former avenue of access to the space which must have existed between the slanting wall and the straight outer wall on the house north side , though a view from the exterior showed where a window had heen boarded up at a very remote date .
the loft above the ceiling which must have had a slanting floor was likewise inaccessible .
when gilman climbed up a ladder to the level loft above the rest of the attic he found vestiges of a bygone aperture tightly and heavily covered with ancient planking and secured by the stout wooden pegs common in colonial carpentry .
no amount of persuasion , however , could induce the stolid landlord to let him investigate either of these two closed spaces .
as time wore along , his absorption in the irregular wall and ceiling of his room increased ; for he began to read into the odd angles a mathematical significance which seemed to offer vague clues regarding their purpose .
old keziah , he reflected , might have had excellent reasons for living in a room with peculiar angles ; for was it not through certain angles that she claimed to have gone outside the boundaries of the world of space we know ?
his interest gradually veered away from the unplumbed voids beyond the slanting surfaces , since it now appeared that the purpose of those surfaces concerned the side he was on .
the touch of and the dreams began early in february .
for some time , apparently , the curious angles of gilman room had been having a strange , almost hypnotic effect on him ; and as the bleak winter advanced he had found himself staring more and more intently at the corner where the ceiling met the wall .
about this period his inability to concentrate on his formal studies worried him considerably , his apprehensions about the examinations being very acute .
but the exaggerated sense of hearing was scarcely less annoying .
life had become an insistent and almost unendurable cacophony , and there was that constant , terrifying impression of other sounds perhaps from regions beyond life trembling on the very brink of audibility .
so far as concrete noises went , the rats in the ancient partitions were the worst .
sometimes their scratching seemed not only furtive but deliberate .
when it came from beyond the slanting north wall it was mixed with a sort of dry rattling ; and when it came from the loft above the slanting ceiling gilman always braced himself as if expecting some horror which only bided its time before descending to engulf him utterly .
the dreams were wholly beyond the pale of sanity , and gilman felt that they must be a result , jointly , of his studies in mathematics and in folklore .
he had been thinking too much about the vague regions which his formulae told him must lie beyond the three dimensions we know , and about the possibility that old keziah mason guided by some influence past all conjecture had actually found the gate to those regions .
the yellowed country records containing her testimony and that of her accusers were so damnably suggestive of things beyond human experience and the descriptions of the darting little furry object which served as her familiar were so painfully realistic despite their incredible details .
that object no larger than a rat and quaintly called by the townspeople brown jenkin seemed to have been the fruit of a remarkable case of sympathetic , for in no less than eleven persons had testified to glimpsing it .
there were recent rumours , too , with a baffling and disconcerting amount of agreement .
witnesses said it had long hair and the shape of a rat , but that its , bearded face was evilly human while its paws were like tiny human hands .
it took messages betwixt old keziah and the devil , and was nursed on the witch blood , which it sucked like a vampire .
its voice was a kind of loathsome titter , and it could speak all languages .
of all the bizarre monstrosities in gilman dreams , nothing filled him with greater panic and nausea than this blasphemous and diminutive hybrid , whose image flitted across his vision in a form a thousandfold more hateful than anything his waking mind had deduced from the ancient records and the modern whispers .
gilman dreams consisted largely in plunges through limitless abysses of inexplicably coloured twilight and bafflingly disordered sound ; abysses whose material and gravitational properties , and whose relation to his own entity , he could not even begin to explain .
he did not walk or climb , fly or swim , crawl or wriggle ; yet always experienced a mode of motion partly voluntary and partly involuntary .
of his own condition he could not well judge , for sight of his arms , legs , and torso seemed always cut off by some odd disarrangement of perspective ; but he felt that his physical organization and faculties were somehow marvellously transmuted and obliquely projected though not without a certain grotesque relationship to his normal proportions and properties .
the abysses were by no means vacant , being crowded with indescribably angled masses of substance , some of which appeared to be organic while others seemed inorganic .
a few of the organic objects tended to awake vague memories in the back of his mind , though he could form no conscious idea of what they mockingly resembled or suggested .
in the later dreams he began to distinguish separate categories into which the organic objects appeared to be divided , and which seemed to involve in each case a radically different species of and basic motivation .
of these categories one seemed to him to include objects slightly less illogical and irrelevant in their motions than the members of the other categories .
all the objects organic and inorganic alike were totally beyond description or even comprehension .
gilman sometimes compared the inorganic matter to prisms , labyrinths , clusters of cubes and planes , and cyclopean buildings ; and the organic things struck him variously as groups of bubbles , octopi , centipedes , living hindoo idols , and intricate arabesques roused into a kind of ophidian animation .
everything he saw was unspeakably menacing and horrible ; and whenever one of the organic entities appeared by its motions to be noticing him , he felt a stark , hideous fright which generally jolted him awake .
of how the organic entities moved , he could tell no more than of how he moved himself .
in time he observed a further mystery the tendency of certain entities to appear suddenly out of empty space , or to disappear totally with equal suddenness .
the shrieking , roaring confusion of sound which permeated the abysses was past all analysis as to pitch , timbre or rhythm ; but seemed to be synchronous with vague visual changes in all the indefinite objects , organic and inorganic alike .
gilman had a constant sense of dread that it might rise to some unbearable degree of intensity during one or another of its obscure , relentlessly inevitable fluctuations .
but it was not in these vortices of complete alienage that he saw brown jenkin .
that shocking little horror was reserved for certain lighter , sharper dreams which assailed him just before he dropped into the fullest depths of sleep .
he would be lying in the dark fighting to keep awake when a faint lambent glow would seem to shimmer around the centuried room , showing in a violet mist the convergence of angled planes which had seized his brain so insidiously .
the horror would appear to pop out of the in the corner and patter toward him over the sagging , floor with evil expectancy in its tiny , bearded human face ; but mercifully , this dream always melted away before the object got close enough to nuzzle him .
it had hellishly long , sharp , canine teeth ; gilman tried to stop up the every day , but each night the real tenants of the partitions would gnaw away the obstruction , whatever it might be .
once he had the landlord nail a tin over it , but the next night the rats gnawed a fresh hole , in making which they pushed or dragged out into the room a curious little fragment of bone .
gilman did not report his fever to the doctor , for he knew he could not pass the examinations if ordered to the college infirmary when every moment was needed for cramming .
as it was , he failed in calculus d and advanced general psychology , though not without hope of making up lost ground before the end of the term .
it was in march when the fresh element entered his lighter preliminary dreaming , and the nightmare shape of brown jenkin began to be companioned by the nebulous blur which grew more and more to resemble a bent old woman .
this addition disturbed him more than he could account for , but finally he decided that it was like an ancient crone whom he had twice actually encountered in the dark tangle of lanes near the abandoned wharves .
on those occasions the evil , sardonic , and seemingly unmotivated stare of the beldame had set him almost shivering especially the first time when an overgrown rat darting across the shadowed mouth of a neighbouring alley had made him think irrationally of brown jenkin .
now , he reflected , those nervous fears were being mirrored in his disordered dreams .
that the influence of the old house was unwholesome he could not deny , but traces of his early morbid interest still held him there .
he argued that the fever alone was responsible for his nightly fantasies , and that when the touch abated he would be free from the monstrous visions .
those visions , however , were of absorbing vividness and convincingness , and whenever he awaked he retained a vague sense of having undergone much more than he remembered .
he was hideously sure that in unrecalled dreams he had talked with both brown jenkin and the old woman , and that they had been urging him to go somewhere with them and to meet a third being of greater potency .
toward the end of march he began to pick up in his mathematics , though the other studies bothered him increasingly .
he was getting an intuitive knack for solving riemannian equations , and astonished professor upham by his comprehension of and other problems which had floored all the rest of the class .
one afternoon there was a discussion of possible freakish curvatures in space , and of theoretical points of approach or even contact between our part of the cosmos and various other regions as distant as the farthest stars or the transgalactic gulfs themselves or even as fabulously remote as the tentatively conceivable cosmic units beyond the whole einsteinian continuum .
gilman handling of this theme filled everyone with admiration , even though some of his hypothetical illustrations caused an increase in the always plentiful gossip about his nervous and solitary eccentricity .
what made the students shake their heads was his sober theory that a man might given mathematical knowledge admittedly beyond all likelihood of human acquirement step deliberately from the earth to any other celestial body which might lie at one of an infinity of specific points in the cosmic pattern .
such a step , he said , would require only two stages ; first , a passage out of the sphere we know , and second , a passage back to the sphere at another point , perhaps one of infinite remoteness .
that this could be accomplished without loss of life was in many cases conceivable .
any being from any part of space could probably survive in the fourth dimension ; and its survival of the second stage would depend upon what alien part of space it might select for its .
denizens of some planets might be able to live on certain others even planets belonging to other galaxies , or to similar dimensional phases of other continua though of course there must be vast numbers of mutually uninhabitable even though mathematically juxtaposed bodies or zones of space .
it was also possible that the inhabitants of a given dimensional realm could survive entry to many unknown and incomprehensible realms of additional or indefinitely multiplied dimensions be they within or outside the given continuum and that the converse would be likewise true .
this was a matter for speculation , though one could be fairly certain that the type of mutation involved in a passage from any given dimensional plane to the next higher one would not be destructive of biological integrity as we understand it .
gilman could not be very clear about his reasons for this last assumption , but his haziness here was more than overbalanced by his clearness on other complex points .
professor upham especially liked his demonstration of the kinship of higher mathematics to certain phases of magical lore transmitted down the ages from an ineffable antiquity human or whose knowledge of the cosmos and its laws was greater than ours .
around april gilman worried considerably because his slow fever did not abate .
he was also troubled by what some of his fellow lodgers said about his .
it seemed that he was often absent from his bed and that the creaking of his floor at certain hours of the night was remarked by the man in the room below .
this fellow also spoke of hearing the tread of shod feet in the night ; but gilman was sure he must have been mistaken in this , since shoes as well as other apparel were always precisely in place in the morning .
one could develop all sorts of aural delusions in this morbid old house for did not gilman himself , even in daylight , now feel certain that noises other than came from the black voids beyond the slanting wall and above the slanting ceiling ?
his pathologically sensitive ears began to listen for faint footfalls in the immemorially sealed loft overhead , and sometimes the illusion of such things was agonizingly realistic .
however , he knew that he had actually become a somnambulist ; for twice at night his room had been found vacant , though with all his clothing in place .
of this he had been assured by frank elwood , the one whose poverty forced him to room in this squalid and unpopular house .
elwood had been studying in the small hours and had come up for help on a differential equation , only to find gilman absent .
it had been rather presumptuous of him to open the unlocked door after knocking had failed to rouse a response , but he had needed the help very badly and thought that his host would not mind a gentle prodding awake .
on neither occasion , though , had gilman been there ; and when told of the matter he wondered where he could have been wandering , barefoot and with only his night clothes on .
he resolved to investigate the matter if reports of his continued , and thought of sprinkling flour on the floor of the corridor to see where his footsteps might lead .
the door was the only conceivable egress , for there was no possible foothold outside the narrow window .
as april advanced , gilman ears were disturbed by the whining prayers of a superstitious named joe mazurewicz who had a room on the ground floor .
mazurewicz had told long , rambling stories about the ghost of old keziah and the furry , nuzzling thing , and had said he was so badly haunted at times that only his silver crucifix given him for the purpose by father iwanicki of stanislaus ' church could bring him relief .
now he was praying because the witches ' sabbath was drawing near .
may eve was walpurgis night , when hell blackest evil roamed the earth and all the slaves of satan gathered for nameless rites and deeds .
it was always a very bad time in arkham , even though the fine folks up in miskatonic avenue and high and saltonstall streets pretended to know nothing about it .
there would be bad doings , and a child or two would probably be missing .
joe knew about such things , for his grandmother in the old country had heard tales from her grandmother .
it was wise to pray and count one beads at this season .
for three months keziah and brown jenkin had not been near joe room , nor near paul choynski room , nor anywhere else and it meant no good when they held off like that .
they must be up to something .
gilman dropped in at the doctor office on the sixteenth of the month , and was surprised to find his temperature was not as high as he had feared .
the physician questioned him sharply , and advised him to see a nerve specialist .
on reflection , he was glad he had not consulted the still more inquisitive college doctor .
old waldron , who had curtailed his activities before , would have made him take a rest an impossible thing now that he was so close to great results in his equations .
he was certainly near the boundary between the known universe and the fourth dimension , and who could say how much farther he might go ?
but even as these thoughts came to him he wondered at the source of his strange confidence .
did all of this perilous sense of immininence come from the formulae on the sheets he covered day by day ?
the soft , stealthy , imaginary footsteps in the sealed loft above were unnerving .
and now , too , there was a growing feeling that somebody was constantly persuading him to do something terrible which he could not do .
how about the somnambulism ?
where did he go sometimes in the night ?
and what was that faint suggestion of sound which once in a while seemed to trickle through the confusion of identifiable sounds even in broad daylight and full wakefulness ?
its rhythm did not correspond to anything on earth , unless perhaps to the cadence of one or two unmentionable , and sometimes he feared it corresponded to certain attributes of the vague shrieking or roaring in those wholly alien abysses of dream .
the dreams were meanwhile getting to be atrocious .
in the lighter preliminary phase the evil old woman was now of fiendish distinctness , and gilman knew she was the one who had frightened him in the slums .
her bent back , long nose , and shrivelled chin were unmistakable , and her shapeless brown garments were like those he remembered .
the expression on her face was one of hideous malevolence and exultation , and when he awaked he could recall a croaking voice that persuaded and threatened .
he must meet the black man and go with them all to the throne of azathoth at the centre of ultimate chaos .
that was what she said .
he must sign the book of azathoth in his own blood and take a new secret name now that his independent delvings had gone so far .
what kept him from going with her and brown jenkin and the other to the throne of chaos where the thin flutes pipe mindlessly was the fact that he had seen the name azathoth in the necronomicon , and knew it stood for a primal evil too horrible for description .
the old woman always appeared out of thin air near the corner where the downward slant met the inward slant .
she seemed to crystallize at a point closer to the ceiling than to the floor , and every night she was a little nearer and more distinct before the dream shifted .
brown jenkin , too was always a little nearer at the last , and its fangs glistened shockingly in that unearthly violet phosphorescence .
its shrill loathsome tittering struck more and more into gilman head , and he could remember in the morning how it had pronounced the words azathoth and nyarlathotep .
in the deeper dreams everything was likewise more distinct , and gilman felt that the twilight abysses around him were those of the fourth dimension .
those organic entities whose motions seemed least flagrantly irrelevant and unmotivated were probably projections of from our own planet , including human beings .
what the others were in their own dimensional sphere or spheres he dared not try to think .
two of the less irrelevantly moving things a rather large congeries of iridescent , prolately spheroidal bubbles and a very much smaller polyhedron of unknown colours and rapidly shifting surface angles seemed to take notice of him and follow him about or float ahead as he changed position among the titan prisms , labyrinths , clusters and ; and all the while the vague shrieking and roaring waxed louder and louder , as if approaching some monstrous climax of utterly unendurable intensity .
during the night of april the new development occurred .
gilman was half involuntarily moving about in the twilight abysses with the and the small polyhedron floating ahead when he noticed the peculiarly regular angles formed by the edges of some gigantic neighbouring .
in another second he was out of the abyss and standing tremulously on a rocky hillside bathed in intense , diffused green light .
he was barefooted and in his nightclothes .
and when he tried to walk discovered that he could scarcely lift his feet .
a swirling vapour hid everything but the immediate sloping terrain from sight , and he shrank from the thought of the sounds , that might surge out of that vapour .
then he saw the two shapes laboriously crawling toward him the old woman and the little furry thing .
the crone strained up to her knees and managed to cross her arms in a singular fashion , while brown jenkin pointed in a certain direction with a horribly anthropoid forepaw which it raised with evident difficulty .
spurred by an impulse he did not originate , gilman dragged himself forward along a course determined by the angle of the old woman arms and the direction of the small monstrosity paw , and before he had shuffled three steps he was back in the twilight abysses .
geometrical shapes seethed around him , and he fell dizzily and interminably .
at last he woke in his bed in the crazily angled garret of the eldritch old house .
he was good for nothing that morning , and stayed away from all his classes .
some unknown attraction was pulling his eyes in a seemingly irrelevant direction , for he could not help staring at a certain vacant spot on the floor .
as the day advanced , the focus of his unseeing eyes changed position , and by noon he had conquered the impulse to stare at vacancy .
about two he went out for lunch and as he threaded the narrow lanes of the city he found himself turning always to the southeast .
only an effort halted him at a cafeteria in church street , and after the meal he felt the unknown pull still more strongly .
he would have to consult a nerve specialist after all perhaps there was a connection with his somnambulism but meanwhile he might at least try to break the morbid spell himself .
undoubtedly he could still manage to walk away from the pull , so with great resolution he headed against it and dragged himself deliberately north along garrison street .
by the time he had reached the bridge over the miskatonic he was in a cold perspiration , and he clutched at the iron railing as he gazed upstream at the island whose regular lines of ancient standing stones brooded sullenly in the afternoon sunlight .
then he gave a start .
for there was a clearly visible living figure on that desolate island , and a second glance told him it was certainly the strange old woman whose sinister aspect had worked itself so disastrously into his dreams .
the tall grass near her was moving , too , as if some other living thing were crawling close to the ground .
when the old woman began to turn toward him he fled precipitately off the bridge and into the shelter of the town labyrinthine waterfront alleys .
distant though the island was , he felt that a monstrous and invincible evil could flow from the sardonic stare of that bent , ancient figure in brown .
the southeastwards pull still held , and only with tremendous resolution could gilman drag himself into the old house and up the rickety stairs .
for hours he sat silent and aimless , with his eyes shifting gradually westward .
about six his sharpened ears caught the whining prayers of joe mazurewicz two floors below , and in desperation he seized his hat and walked out into the streets , letting the now directly southward pull carry him where it might .
an hour later darkness found him in the open fields beyond hangman brook , with the glimmering spring stars shining ahead .
the urge to walk was gradually changing to an urge to leap mystically into space , and suddenly he realized just where the source of the pull lay .
it was in the sky .
a definite point among the stars had a claim on him and was calling him .
apparently it was a point somewhere between hydra and argo navis , and he knew that he had been urged toward it ever since he had awaked soon after dawn .
in the morning it had been underfoot , and now it was roughly south but stealing toward the west .
what was the meaning of this new thing ?
was he going mad ?
how long would it last ?
again mustering his resolution , gilman turned and dragged himself back to the sinister old house .
mazurewicz was waiting for him at the door , and seemed both anxious and reluctant to whisper some fresh bit of superstition .
it was about the .
joe had been out celebrating the night before and it was patriots ' day in massachusetts and had come home after midnight .
looking up at the house from outside , he had thought at first that gilman window was dark , but then he had seen the faint violet glow within .
he wanted to warn the gentleman about that glow , for everybody in arkham knew it was keziah which played near brown jenkin and the ghost of the old crone herself .
he had not mentioned this before , but now he must tell about it because it meant that keziah and her familiar were haunting the young gentleman .
sometimes he and paul choynski and landlord dombrowski thought they saw that light seeping out of cracks in the sealed loft above the young gentleman room , but they had all agreed not to talk about that .
however , it would be better for the gentleman to take another room and get a crucifix from some good priest like father iwanicki .
as the man rambled on , gilman felt a nameless panic clutch at his throat .
he knew that joe must have been half drunk when he came home the night before ; yet the mention of a violet light in the garret window was of frightful import .
it was a lambent glow of this sort which always played about the old woman and the small furry thing in those lighter , sharper dreams which prefaced his plunge into unknown abysses , and the thought that a wakeful second person could see the was utterly beyond sane harborage .
yet where had the fellow got such an odd notion ?
had he himself talked as well as walked around the house in his sleep ?
no , joe said , he had not but he must check up on this .
perhaps frank elwood could tell him something , though he hated to ask .
fever wild dreams somnambulism illusions of sounds a pull toward a point in the sky and now a suspicion of insane !
he must stop studying , see a nerve specialist , and take himself in hand .
when he climbed to the second storey he paused at elwood door but saw that the other youth was out .
reluctantly he continued up to his garret room and sat down in the dark .
his gaze was still pulled to the southward , but he also found himself listening intently for some sound in the closed loft above , and half imagining that an evil violet light seeped down through an infinitesimal crack in the low , slanting ceiling .
that night as gilman slept , the violet light broke upon him with heightened intensity , and the old witch and small furry thing , getting closer than ever before , mocked him with inhuman squeals and devilish gestures .
he was glad to sink into the vaguely roaring twilight abysses , though the pursuit of that iridescent and that kaleidoscopic little polyhedron was menacing and irritating .
then came the shift as vast converging planes of a substance loomed above and below him a shift which ended in a flash of delirium and a blaze of unknown , alien light in which yellow , carmine , and indigo were madly and inextricably blended .
he was half lying on a high , fantastically balustraded terrace above a boundless jungle of outlandish , incredible peaks , balanced planes , domes , minarets , horizontal disks poised on pinnacles , and numberless forms of still greater wildness some of stone and some of metal which glittered gorgeously in the mixed , almost blistering glare from a sky .
looking upward he saw three stupendous disks of flame , each of a different hue , and at a different height above an infinitely distant curving horizon of low mountains .
behind him tiers of higher terraces towered aloft as far as he could see .
the city below stretched away to the limits of vision , and he hoped that no sound would well up from it .
the pavement from which he easily raised himself was a veined polished stone beyond his power to identify , and the tiles were cut in shapes which struck him as less asymmetrical than based on some unearthly symmetry whose laws he could not comprehend .
the balustrade was , delicate , and fantastically wrought , while along the rail were ranged at short intervals little figures of grotesque design and exquisite workmanship .
they , like the whole balustrade , seemed to be made of some sort of shining metal whose colour could not be guessed in the chaos of mixed effulgences , and their nature utterly defied conjecture .
they represented some ridged objects with thin horizontal arms radiating from a central ring and with vertical knobs or bulbs projecting from the head and base of the barrel .
each of these knobs was the hub of a system of five long , flat , triangularly tapering arms arranged around it like the arms of a starfish nearly horizontal , but curving slightly away from the central barrel .
the base of the bottom knob was fused to the long railing with so delicate a point of contact that several figures had been broken off and were missing .
the figures were about four and a half inches in height , while the spiky arms gave them a maximum diameter of about two and a half inches .
when gilman stood up , the tiles felt hot to his bare feet .
he was wholly alone , and his first act was to walk to the balustrade and look dizzily down at the endless , cyclopean city almost two thousand feet below .
as he listened he thought a rhythmic confusion of faint musical pipings covering a wide tonal range welled up from the narrow streets beneath , and he wished he might discern the denizens of the place .
the sight turned him giddy after a while , so that he would have fallen to the pavement had he not clutched instinctively at the lustrous balustrade .
his right hand fell on one of the projecting figures , the touch seeming to steady him slightly .
it was too much , however , for the exotic delicacy of the , and the spiky figure snapped off under his grasp .
still half dazed , he continued to clutch it as his other hand seized a vacant space on the smooth railing .
but now his ears caught something behind him , and he looked back across the level terrace .
approaching him softly though without apparent furtiveness were five figures , two of which were the sinister old woman and the fanged , furry little animal .
the other three were what sent him unconscious ; for they were living entities about eight feet high , shaped precisely like the spiky images on the balustrade , and propelling themselves by a wriggling of their lower set of .
gilman awoke in his bed , drenched by a cold perspiration and with a smarting sensation in his face , hands and feet .
springing to the floor , he washed and dressed in frantic haste , as if it were necessary for him to get out of the house as quickly as possible .
he did not know where he wished to go , but felt that once more he would have to sacrifice his classes .
the odd pull toward that spot in the sky between hydra and argo had abated , but another of even greater strength had taken its place .
now he felt that he must go north infinitely north .
he dreaded to cross the bridge that gave a view of the desolate island in the miskatonic , so went over the peabody avenue bridge .
very often he stumbled , for his eyes and ears were chained to an extremely lofty point in the blank blue sky .
after about an hour he got himself under better control , and saw that he was far from the city .
all around him stretched the bleak emptiness of salt marshes , while the narrow road ahead led to innsmouth that ancient , town which arkham people were so curiously unwilling to visit .
though the northward pull had not diminished , he resisted it as he had resisted the other pull , and finally found that he could almost balance the one against the other .
plodding back to town and getting some coffee at a soda fountain , he dragged himself into the public library and browsed aimlessly among the lighter magazines .
once he met some friends who remarked how oddly sunburned he looked , but he did not tell them of his walk .
at three he took some lunch at a restaurant , noting meanwhile that the pull had either lessened or divided itself .
after that he killed the time at a cheap cinema show , seeing the inane performance over and over again without paying any attention to it .
about nine at night he drifted homeward and shuffled into the ancient house .
joe mazurewicz was whining unintelligible prayers , and gilman hastened up to his own garret chamber without pausing to see if elwood was in .
it was when he turned on the feeble electric light that the shock came .
at once he saw there was something on the table which did not belong there , and a second look left no room for doubt .
lying on its side for it could not stand up alone was the exotic spiky figure which in his monstrous dream he had broken off the fantastic balustrade .
no detail was missing .
the ridged , center , the thin radiating arms , the knobs at each end , and the flat , slightly spreading from those knobs all were there .
in the electric light the colour seemed to be a kind of iridescent grey veined with green ; and gilman could see amidst his horror and bewilderment that one of the knobs ended in a jagged break , corresponding to its former point of attachment to the .
only his tendency toward a dazed stupor prevented him from screaming aloud .
this fusion of dream and reality was too much to bear .
still dazed , he clutched at the spiky thing and staggered downstairs to landlord dombrowski quarters .
the whining prayers of the superstitious were still sounding through the mouldy halls , but gilman did not mind them now .
the landlord was in , and greeted him pleasantly .
no , he had not seen that thing before and did not know anything about it .
but his wife had said she found a funny tin thing in one of the beds when she fixed the rooms at noon , and maybe that was it .
dombrowski called her , and she waddled in .
yes , that was the thing .
she had found it in the young gentleman bed on the side next the wall .
it had looked very queer to her , but of course the young gentleman had lots of queer things in his room books and curios and pictures and markings on paper .
she certainly knew nothing about it .
so gilman climbed upstairs again in mental turmoil , convinced that he was either still dreaming or that his somnambulism had run to incredible extremes and led him to depredations in unknown places .
where had he got this outré thing ?
he did not recall seeing it in any museum in arkham .
it must have been somewhere , though ; and the sight of it as he snatched it in his sleep must have caused the odd of the balustraded terrace .
next day he would make some very guarded inquiries and perhaps see the nerve specialist .
meanwhile he would try to keep track of his somnambulism .
as he went upstairs and across the garret hall he sprinkled about some flour which he had borrowed with a frank admission as to its purpose from the landlord .
he had stopped at elwood door on the way , but had found all dark within .
entering his room , he placed the spiky thing on the table , and lay down in complete mental and physical exhaustion without pausing to undress .
from the closed loft above the slanting ceiling he thought he heard a faint scratching and padding , but he was too disorganized even to mind it .
that cryptical pull from the north was getting very strong again , though it seemed now to come from a lower place in the sky .
in the dazzling violet light of dream the old woman and the fanged , furry thing came again and with a greater distinctness than on any former occasion .
this time they actually reached him , and he felt the crone withered claws clutching at him .
he was pulled out of bed and into empty space , and for a moment he heard a rhythmic roaring and saw the twilight amorphousness of the vague abysses seething around him .
but that moment was very brief , for presently he was in a crude , windowless little space with rough beams and planks rising to a peak just above his head , and with a curious slanting floor underfoot .
propped level on that floor were low cases full of books of every degree of antiquity and disintegration , and in the centre were a table and bench , both apparently fastened in place .
small objects of unknown shape and nature were ranged on the tops of the cases , and in the flaming violet light gilman thought he saw a counterpart of the spiky image which had puzzled him so horribly .
on the left the floor fell abruptly away , leaving a black triangular gulf out of which , after a second dry rattling , there presently climbed the hateful little furry thing with the yellow fangs and bearded human face .
the beldame still clutched him , and beyond the table stood a figure he had never seen before a tall , lean man of dead black colouration but without the slightest sign of negroid features wholly devoid of either hair or beard , and wearing as his only garment a shapeless robe of some heavy black fabric .
his feet were indistinguishable because of the table and bench , but he must have been shod , since there was a clicking whenever he changed position .
the man did not speak , and bore no trace of expression on his small , regular features .
he merely pointed to a book of prodigious size which lay open on the table , while the beldame thrust a huge grey quill into gilman right hand .
over everything was a pall of intensely maddening fear , and the climax was reached when the furry thing ran up the dreamer clothing to his shoulders and then down his left arm , finally biting him sharply in the wrist just below his cuff .
as the blood spurted from this wound gilman lapsed into a faint .
he awaked on the morning of the with a pain in his left wrist , and saw that his cuff was brown with dried blood .
his recollections were very confused , but the scene with the black man in the unknown space stood out vividly .
the rats must have bitten him as he slept , giving rise to the climax of that frightful dream .
opening the door , he saw that the flour on the corridor floor was undisturbed except for the huge prints of the loutish fellow who roomed at the other end of the garret .
so he had not been this time .
but something would have to be done about those rats .
he would speak to the landlord about them .
again he tried to stop up the hole at the base of the slanting wall , wedging in a candlestick which seemed of about the right size .
his ears were ringing horribly , as if with the residual echoes of some horrible noise heard in dreams .
as he bathed and changed clothes he tried to recall what he had dreamed after the scene in the space , but nothing definite would crystallize in his mind .
that scene itself must have corresponded to the sealed loft overhead , which had begun to attack his imagination so violently , but later impressions were faint and hazy .
there were suggestions of the vague , twilight abysses , and of still vaster , blacker abysses beyond them abysses in which all fixed suggestions were absent .
he had been taken there by the and the little polyhedron which always dogged him ; but they , like himself , had changed to wisps of mist in this farther void of ultimate blackness .
something else had gone on ahead a larger wisp which now and then condensed into nameless approximations of form and he thought that their progress had not been in a straight line , but rather along the alien curves and spirals of some ethereal vortex which obeyed laws unknown to the physics and mathematics of any conceivable cosmos .
eventually there had been a hint of vast , leaping shadows , of a monstrous , pulsing , and of the thin , monotonous piping of an unseen flute but that was all .
gilman decided he had picked up that last conception from what he had read in the necronomicon about the mindless entity azathoth , which rules all time and space from a black throne at the centre of chaos .
when the blood was washed away the wrist wound proved very slight , and gilman puzzled over the location of the two tiny punctures .
it occurred to him that there was no blood on the bedspread where he had lain which was very curious in view of the amount on his skin and cuff .
had he been within his room , and had the rat bitten him as he sat in some chair or paused in some less rational position ?
he looked in every corner for brownish drops or stains , but did not find any .
he had better , he thought , sprinkle flour within the room as well as outside the door though after all no further proof of his was needed .
he knew he did walk and the thing to do now was to stop it .
he must ask frank elwood for help .
this morning the strange pulls from space seemed lessened , though they were replaced by another sensation even more inexplicable .
it was a vague , insistent impulse to fly away from his present situation , but held not a hint of the specific direction in which he wished to fly .
as he picked up the strange spiky image on the table he thought the older northward pull grew a trifle stronger ; but even so , it was wholly overruled by the newer and more bewildering urge .
he took the spiky image down to elwood room , steeling himself against the whines of the which welled up from the ground floor .
elwood was in , thank heaven , and appeared to be stirring about .
there was time for a little conversation before leaving for breakfast and college , so gilman hurriedly poured forth an account of his recent dreams and fears .
his host was very sympathetic , and agreed that something ought to be done .
he was shocked by his guest drawn , haggard aspect , and noticed the queer , sunburn which others had remarked during the past week .
there was not much , though , that he could say .
he had not seen gilman on any expedition , and had no idea what the curious image could be .
he had , though , heard the who lodged just under gilman talking to mazurewicz one evening .
they were telling each other how badly they dreaded the coming of walpurgis night , now only a few days off ; and were exchanging pitying comments about the poor , doomed young gentleman .
desrochers , the fellow under gilman room , had spoken of nocturnal footsteps shod and unshod , and of the violet light he saw one night when he had stolen fearfully up to peer through gilman keyhole .
he had not dared to peer , he told mazurewicz , after he had glimpsed that light through the cracks around the door .
there had been soft talking , too and as he began to describe it his voice had sunk to an inaudible whisper .
elwood could not imagine what had set these superstitious creatures gossiping , but supposed their imaginations had been roused by gilman late hours and somnolent walking and talking on the one hand , and by the nearness of may eve on the other hand .
that gilman talked in his sleep was plain , and it was obviously from desrochers ' keyhole listenings that the delusive notion of the violet had got abroad .
these simple people were quick to imagine they had seen any odd thing they had heard about .
as for a plan of action gilman had better move down to elwood room and avoid sleeping alone .
elwood would , if awake , rouse him whenever he began to talk or rise in his sleep .
very soon , too , he must see the specialist .
meanwhile they would take the spiky image around to the various museums and to certain professors ; seeking identification and stating that it had been found in a public .
also , dombrowski must attend to the poisoning of those rats in the walls .
braced up by elwood companionship , gilman attended classes that day .
strange urges still tugged at him , but he could sidetrack them with considerable success .
during a free period he showed the queer image to several professors , all of whom were intensely interested , though none of them could shed any light upon its nature or origin .
that night he slept on a couch which elwood had had the landlord bring to the room , and for the first time in weeks was wholly free from disquieting dreams .
but the feverishness still hung on , and the whines of the were an unnerving influence .
during the next few days gilman enjoyed an almost perfect immunity from morbid manifestations .
he had , elwood said , showed no tendency to talk or rise in his sleep ; and meanwhile the landlord was putting everywhere .
the only disturbing element was the talk among the superstitious foreigners , whose imaginations had become highly excited .
mazurewicz was always trying to make him get a crucifix , and finally forced one upon him which he said had been blessed by the good father iwanicki .
desrochers , too , had something to say ; in fact , he insisted that cautious steps had sounded in the now vacant room above him on the first and second nights of gilinan absence from it .
paul choynski thought he heard sounds in the halls and on the stairs at night , and claimed that his door had been softly tried , while dombrowski vowed she had seen brown jenkin for the first time since .
but such naïve reports could mean very little , and gilman let the cheap metal crucifix hang idly from a knob on his host dresser .
for three days gilman and elwood canvassed the local museums in an effort to identify the strange spiky image , but always without success .
in every quarter , however , interest was intense ; for the utter alienage of the thing was a tremendous challenge to scientific curiosity .
one of the small radiating arms was broken off and subjected to chemical analysis .
professor ellery found platinum , iron and tellurium in the strange alloy ; but mixed with these were at least three other apparent elements of high atomic weight which chemistry was absolutely powerless to classify .
not only did they fail to correspond with any known element , but they did not even fit the vacant places reserved for probable elements in the periodic system .
the mystery remains unsolved to this day , though the image is on exhibition at the museum of miskatonic university .
on the morning of april a fresh appeared in the room where gilman was a guest , but dombrowski tinned it up during the day .
the poison was not having much effect , for scratchings and scurryings in the walls were virtually undiminished .
elwood was out late that night , and gilman waited up for him .
he did not wish to go to sleep in a room alone especially since he thought he had glimpsed in the evening twilight the repellent old woman whose image had become so horribly transferred to his dreams .
he wondered who she was , and what had been near her rattling the tin can in a at the mouth of a squalid courtyard .
the crone had seemed to notice him and leer evilly at him though perhaps this was merely his imagination .
the next day both youths felt very tired , and knew they would sleep like logs when night came .
in the evening they drowsily discussed the mathematical studies which had so completely and perhaps harmfully engrossed gilman , and speculated about the linkage with ancient magic and folklore which seemed so darkly probable .
they spoke of old keziah mason , and elwood agreed that gilman had good scientific grounds for thinking she might have stumbled on strange and significant information .
the hidden cults to which these witches belonged often guarded and handed down surprising secrets from elder , forgotten eons ; and it was by no means impossible that keziah had actually mastered the art of passing through dimensional gates .
tradition emphasizes the uselessness of material barriers in halting a witch notions , and who can say what underlies the old tales of broomstick rides through the night ?
whether a modern student could ever gain similar powers from mathematical research alone , was still to be seen .
success , gilman added , might lead to dangerous and unthinkable situations , for who could foretell the conditions pervading an adjacent but normally inaccessible dimension ?
on the other hand , the picturesque possibilities were enormous .
time could not exist in certain belts of space , and by entering and remaining in such a belt one might preserve one life and age indefinitely ; never suffering organic metabolism or deterioration except for slight amounts incurred during visits to one own or similar planes .
one might , for example , pass into a timeless dimension and emerge at some remote period of the earth history as young as before .
whether anybody had ever managed to do this , one could hardly conjecture with any degree of authority .
old legends are hazy and ambiguous , and in historic times all attempts at crossing forbidden gaps seem complicated by strange and terrible alliances with beings and messengers from outside .
there was the immemorial figure of the deputy or messenger of hidden and terrible powers the black man of the , and the nyarlathotep of the necronomicon .
there was , too , the baffling problem of the lesser messengers or intermediaries the and queer hybrids which legend depicts as witches ' familiars .
as gilman and elwood retired , too sleepy to argue further , they heard joe mazurewicz reel into the house half drunk , and shuddered at the desperate wildness of his whining prayers .
that night gilman saw the violet light again .
in his dream he had heard a scratching and gnawing in the partitions , and thought that someone fumbled clumsily at the latch .
then he saw the old woman and the small furry thing advancing toward him over the carpeted floor .
the beldame face was alight with inhuman exultation , and the little morbidity tittered mockingly as it pointed at the form of elwood on the other couch across the room .
a paralysis of fear stifled all attempts to cry out .
as once before , the hideous crone seized gilman by the shoulders , yanking him out of bed and into empty space .
again the infinitude of the shrieking abysses flashed past him , but in another second he thought he was in a dark , muddy , unknown alley of foetid odors with the rotting walls of ancient houses towering up on every hand .
ahead was the robed black man he had seen in the peaked space in the other dream , while from a lesser distance the old woman was beckoning and grimacing imperiously .
brown jenkin was rubbing itself with a kind of affectionate playfulness around the ankles of the black man , which the deep mud largely concealed .
there was a dark open doorway on the right , to which the black man silently pointed .
into this the grinning crone started , dragging gilman after her by his pajama sleeves .
there were staircases which creaked ominously , and on which the old woman seemed to radiate a faint violet light ; and finally a door leading off a landing .
the crone fumbled with the latch and pushed the door open , motioning to gilman to wait , and disappearing inside the black aperture .
the youth ears caught a hideous strangled cry , and presently the beldame came out of the room bearing a small , senseless form which she thrust at the dreamer as if ordering him to carry it .
the sight of this form , and the expression on its face , broke the spell .
still too dazed to cry out , he plunged recklessly down the noisome staircase and into the mud outside , halting only when seized and choked by the waiting black man .
as consciousness departed he heard the faint , shrill tittering of the fanged , abnormality .
on the morning of the gilman awaked into a maelstrom of horror .
the instant he opened his eyes he knew something was terribly wrong , for he was back in his old garret room with the slanting wall and ceiling , sprawled on the now unmade bed .
his throat was aching inexplicably , and as he struggled to a sitting posture he saw with growing fright that his feet and pajama bottoms were brown with caked mud .
for the moment his recollections were hopelessly hazy , but he knew at least that he must have been .
elwood had been lost too deeply in slumber to hear and stop him .
on the floor were confused muddy prints , but oddly enough they did not extend all the way to the door .
the more gilman looked at them , the more peculiar they seemed ; for in addition to those he could recognize as his there were some smaller , almost round markings such as the legs of a large chair or a table might make , except that most of them tended to be divided into halves .
there were also some curious muddy leading out of a fresh hole and back into it again .
utter bewilderment and the fear of madness racked gilman as he staggered to the door and saw that there were no muddy prints outside .
the more he remembered of his hideous dream the more terrified he felt , and it added to his desperation to hear joe mazurewicz chanting mournfully two floors below .
descending to elwood room he roused his host and began telling of how he had found himself , but elwood could form no idea of what might really have happened .
where gilman could have been , how he got back to his room without making tracks in the hall , and how the muddy , prints came to be mixed with his in the garret chamber , were wholly beyond conjecture .
then there were those dark , livid marks on his throat , as if he had tried to strangle himself .
he put his hands up to them , but found that they did not even approximately fit .
while they were talking , desrochers dropped in to say that he had heard a terrific clattering overhead in the dark small hours .
no , there had been no one on the stairs after midnight , though just before midnight he had heard faint footfalls in the garret , and cautiously descending steps he did not like .
it was , he added , a very bad time of year for arkham .
the young gentleman had better be sure to wear the crucifix joe mazurewicz had given him .
even the daytime was not safe , for after dawn there had been strange sounds in the house especially a thin , childish wail hastily choked off .
gilman mechanically attended classes that morning , but was wholly unable to fix his mind on his studies .
a mood of hideous apprehension and expectancy had seized him , and he seemed to be awaiting the fall of some annihilating blow .
at noon he lunched at the university spa , picking up a paper from the next seat as he waited for dessert .
but he never ate that dessert ; for an item on the paper first page left him limp , , and able only to pay his check and stagger back to elwood room .
there had been a strange kidnapping the night before in orne gangway , and the child of a laundry worker named anastasia wolejko had completely vanished from sight .
the mother , it appeared , had feared the event for some time ; but the reasons she assigned for her fear were so grotesque that no one took them seriously .
she had , she said , seen brown jenkin about the place now and then ever since early in march , and knew from its grimaces and titterings that little ladislas must be marked for sacrifice at the awful sabbat on walpurgis night .
she had asked her neighbour mary czanek to sleep in the room and try to protect the child , but mary had not dared .
she could not tell the police , for they never believed such things .
children had been taken that way every year ever since she could remember .
and her friend pete stowacki would not help because he wanted the child out of the way .
but what threw gilman into a cold perspiration was the report of a pair of revellers who had been walking past the mouth of the gangway just after midnight .
they admitted they had been drunk , but both vowed they had seen a crazily dressed trio furtively entering the dark passageway .
there had , they said , been a huge robed negro , a little old woman in rags , and a young white man in his .
the old woman had been dragging the youth , while around the feet of the negro a tame rat was rubbing and weaving in the brown mud .
gilman sat in a daze all the afternoon , and elwood who had meanwhile seen the papers and formed terrible conjectures from them found him thus when he came home .
this time neither could doubt but that something hideously serious was closing in around them .
between the phantasms of nightmare and the realities of the objective world a monstrous and unthinkable relationship was crystallizing , and only stupendous vigilance could avert still more direful developments .
gilman must see a specialist sooner or later , but not just now , when all the papers were full of this kidnapping business .
just what had really happened was maddeningly obscure , and for a moment both gilman and elwood exchanged whispered theories of the wildest kind .
had gilman unconsciously succeeded better than he knew in his studies of space and its dimensions ?
had he actually slipped outside our sphere to points unguessed and unimaginable ?
where if anywhere had he been on those nights of demoniac alienage ?
the roaring twilight abysses the green hillside the blistering terrace the pulls from the stars the ultimate black vortex the black man the muddy alley and the stairs the old witch and the fanged , furry horror the and the little polyhedron the strange sunburn the the unexplained image the muddy feet the throat marks the tales and fears of the superstitious foreigners what did all this mean ?
to what extent could the laws of sanity apply to such a case ?
there was no sleep for either of them that night , but next day they both cut classes and drowsed .
this was april thirtieth , and with the dusk would come the hellish which all the foreigners and the superstitious old folk feared .
mazurewicz came home at six and said people at the mill were whispering that the walpurgis revels would be held in the dark ravine beyond meadow hill where the old white stone stands in a place queerly devoid of all .
some of them had even told the police and advised them to look there for the missing wolejko child , but they did not believe anything would be done .
joe insisted that the poor young gentleman wear his crucifix , and gilman put it on and dropped it inside his shirt to humour the fellow .
late at night the two youths sat drowsing in their chairs , lulled by the praying of the on the floor below .
gilman listened as he nodded , his preternaturally sharpened hearing seeming to strain for some subtle , dreaded murmur beyond the noises in the ancient house .
unwholesome recollections of things in the necronomicon and the black book welled up , and he found himself swaying to infandous rhythms said to pertain to the blackest ceremonies of the sabbat and to have an origin outside the time and space we comprehend .
presently he realized what he was listening for the hellish chant of the celebrants in the distant black valley .
how did he know so much about what they expected ?
how did he know the time when nahab and her acolyte were due to bear the brimming bowl which would follow the black cock and the black goat ?
he saw that elwood had dropped asleep , and tried to call out and waken him .
something , however , closed his throat .
he was not his own master .
had he signed the black man book after all ?
then his fevered , abnormal hearing caught the distant , windborne notes .
over miles of hill and field and alley they came , but he recognized them none the less .
the fires must be lit , and the dancers must be starting in .
how could he keep himself from going ?
what was it that had enmeshed him ?
mathematics folklore the house old keziah brown jenkin and now he saw that there was a fresh in the wall near his couch .
above the distant chanting and the nearer praying of joe mazurewicz came another sound a stealthy , determined scratching in the partitions .
he hoped the electric lights would not go out .
then he saw the fanged , bearded little face in the the accursed little face which he at last realized bore such a shocking , mocking resemblance to old keziah and heard the faint fumbling at the door .
the screaming twilight abysses flashed before him , and he felt himself helpless in the formless grasp of the iridescent .
ahead raced the small , kaleidoscopic polyhedron and all through the churning void there was a heightening and acceleration of the vague tonal pattern which seemed to foreshadow some unutterable and unendurable climax .
he seemed to know what was coming the monstrous burst of in whose cosmic timbre would be concentrated all the primal , ultimate seethings which lie behind the massed spheres of matter and sometimes break forth in measured reverberations that penetrate faintly to every layer of entity and give hideous significance throughout the worlds to certain dreaded periods .
but all this vanished in a second .
he was again in the cramped , peaked space with the slanting floor , the low cases of ancient books , the bench and table , the queer objects , and the triangular gulf at one side .
on the table lay a small white figure an infant boy , unclothed and unconscious while on the other side stood the monstrous , leering old woman with a gleaming , knife in her right hand , and a queerly proportioned pale metal bowl covered with curiously chased designs and having delicate lateral handles in her left .
she was intoning some croaking ritual in a language which gilman could not understand , but which seemed like something guardedly quoted in the necronomicon .
as the scene grew clearer he saw the ancient crone bend forward and extend the empty bowl across the table and unable to control his own emotions , he reached far forward and took it in both hands , noticing as he did so its comparative lightness .
at the same moment the disgusting form of brown jenkin scrambled up over the brink of the triangular black gulf on his left .
the crone now motioned him to hold the bowl in a certain position while she raised the huge , grotesque knife above the small white victim as high as her right hand could reach .
the fanged , furry thing began tittering a continuation of the unknown ritual , while the witch croaked loathsome responses .
gilman felt a gnawing poignant abhorrence shoot through his mental and emotional paralysis , and the light metal bowl shook in his grasp .
a second later the downward motion of the knife broke the spell completely , and he dropped the bowl with a resounding clangour while his hands darted out frantically to stop the monstrous deed .
in an instant he had edged up the slanting floor around the end of the table and wrenched the knife from the old woman claws ; sending it clattering over the brink of the narrow triangular gulf .
in another instant , however , matters were reversed ; for those murderous claws had locked themselves tightly around his own throat , while the wrinkled face was twisted with insane fury .
he felt the chain of the cheap crucifix grinding into his neck , and in his peril wondered how the sight of the object itself would affect the evil creature .
her strength was altogether superhuman , but as she continued her choking he reached feebly in his shirt and drew out the metal symbol , snapping the chain and pulling it free .
at sight of the device the witch seemed struck with panic , and her grip relaxed long enough to give gilman a chance to break it entirely .
he pulled the claws from his neck , and would have dragged the beldame over the edge of the gulf had not the claws received a fresh access of strength and closed in again .
this time he resolved to reply in kind , and his own hands reached out for the creature throat .
before she saw what he was doing he had the chain of the crucifix twisted about her neck , and a moment later he had tightened it enough to cut off her breath .
during her last struggle he felt something bite at his ankle , and saw that brown jenkin had come to her aid .
with one savage kick he sent the morbidity over the edge of the gulf and heard it whimper on some level far below .
whether he had killed the ancient crone he did not know , but he let her rest on the floor where she had fallen .
then , as he turned away , he saw on the table a sight which nearly snapped the last thread of his reason .
brown jenkin , tough of sinew and with four tiny hands of demoniac dexterity , had been busy while the witch was throttling him , and his efforts had been in vain .
what he had prevented the knife from doing to the victim chest , the yellow fangs of the furry blasphemy had done to a wrist and the bowl so lately on the floor stood full beside the small lifeless body .
in his gilman heard the hellish chant of the sabbat coming from an infinite distance , and knew the black man must be there .
confused memories mixed themselves with his mathematics , and he believed his subconscious mind held the angles which he needed to guide him back to the normal world alone and unaided for the first time .
he felt sure he was in the immemorially sealed loft above his own room , but whether he could ever escape through the slanting floor or the egress he doubted greatly .
besides , would not an escape from a bring him merely into a an abnormal projection of the actual place he sought ?
he was wholly bewildered as to the relation betwixt dream and reality in all his experiences .
the passage through the vague abysses would be frightful , for the would be vibrating , and at last he would have to hear that cosmic pulsing which he so mortally dreaded .
even now he could detect a low , monstrous shaking whose tempo he suspected all too well .
at it always mounted and reached through to the worlds to summon the initiate to nameless rites .
half the chants of the sabbat were patterned on this faintly overheard pulsing which no earthly ear could endure in its unveiled spatial fulness .
gilman wondered , too , whether he could trust his instincts to take him back to the right part of space .
how could he be sure he would not land on that hillside of a far planet , on the tessellated terrace above the city of tentacled monsters somewhere beyond the galaxy or in the spiral black vortices of that ultimate void of chaos where reigns the mindless azathoth ?
just before he made the plunge the violet light went out and left him in utter blackness .
the witch old keziah nahab that must have meant her death .
and mixed with the distant chant of the sabbat and the whimpers of brown jenkin in the gulf below he thought he heard another and wilder whine from unknown depths .
joe mazurewicz the prayers against the crawling chaos now turning to an inexplicably triumphant shriek worlds of sardonic actuality impinging on vortices of febrile dream iä !
!
the goat with a thousand young
they found gilman on the floor of his old garret room long before dawn , for the terrible cry had brought desrochers and choynski and dombrowski and mazurewicz at once , and had even wakened the soundly sleeping elwood in his chair .
he was alive , and with open , staring eyes , but seemed largely unconscious .
on his throat were the marks of murderous hands , and on his left ankle was a distressing .
his clothing was badly rumpled and joe crucifix was missing , elwood trembled , afraid even to speculate what new form his friend had taken .
mazurewicz seemed half dazed because of a sign he said he had had in response to his prayers , and he crossed himself frantically when the squealing and whimpering of a rat sounded from beyond the slanting partition .
when the dreamer was settled on his couch in elwood room they sent for doctor malkowski a local practitioner who would repeat no tales where they might prove embarrassing and he gave gilman two hypodermic injections which caused him to relax in something like natural drowsiness .
during the day the patient regained consciousness at times and whispered his newest dream disjointedly to elwood .
it was a painful process , and at its very start brought out a fresh and disconcerting fact .
gilman whose ears had so lately possessed an abnormal sensitiveness was now .
doctor malkowski , summoned again in haste , told elwood that both were ruptured , as if by the impact of some stupendous sound intense beyond all human conception or endurance .
how such a sound could have been heard in the last few hours without arousing all the miskatonic valley was more than the honest physician could say .
elwood wrote his part of the colloquy on paper , so that a fairly easy communication was maintained .
neither knew what to make of the whole chaotic business , and decided it would be better if they thought as little as possible about it .
both , though , agreed that they must leave this ancient and accursed house as soon as it could be arranged .
evening papers spoke of a police raid on some curious revellers in a ravine beyond meadow hill just before dawn , and mentioned that the white stone there was an object of superstitious regard .
nobody had been caught , but among the scattering fugitives had been glimpsed a huge negro .
in another column it was stated that no trace of the missing child ladislas wolejko had been found .
the crowning horror came that very night .
elwood will never forget it , and was forced to stay out of college the rest of the term because of the resulting nervous breakdown .
he had thought he heard rats in the partition all the evening , but paid little attention to them .
then , long after both he and gilman had retired , the atrocious shrieking began .
elwood jumped up , turned on the lights and rushed over to his guest couch .
the occupant was emitting sounds of veritably inhuman nature , as if racked by some torment beyond description .
he was writhing under the bedclothes , and a great stain was beginning to appear on the blankets .
elwood scarcely dared to touch him , but gradually the screaming and writhing subsided .
by this time dombrowski , choynski , desrochers , mazurewicz , and the lodger were all crowding into the doorway , and the landlord had sent his wife back to telephone for doctor malkowaki .
everybody shrieked when a large form suddenly jumped out from beneath the ensanguined bedclothes and scuttled across the floor to a fresh , open hole close by .
when the doctor arrived and began to pull down those frightful covers walter gilman was dead .
it would be barbarous to do more than suggest what had killed gilman .
there had been virtually a tunnel through his body something had eaten his heart out .
dombrowski , frantic at the failure of his efforts , cast aside all thought of his lease and within a week had moved with all his older lodgers to a dingy but less ancient house in walnut street .
the worst thing for a while was keeping joe mazurewicz quiet ; for the brooding would never stay sober , and was constantly whining and muttering about spectral and terrible things .
it seems that on that last hideous night joe had stooped to look at the crimson which led from gilman couch to the hole .
on the carpet they were very indistinct , but a piece of open flooring intervened between the carpet edge and the baseboard .
there mazurewicz had found something monstrous or thought he had , for no one else could quite agree with him despite the undeniable queerness of the prints .
the tracks on the flooring were certainly vastly unlike the average prints of a rat but even choynski and desrochers would not admit that they were like the prints of four tiny human hands .
the house was never rented again .
as soon as dombrowski left it the pall of its final desolation began to descend , for people shunned it both on account of its old reputation and because of the new foetid odour .
perhaps the had worked after all , for not long after his departure the place became a neighbourhood nuisance .
health officials traced the smell to the closed spaces above and beside the eastern garret room , and agreed that the number of dead rats must be enormous .
they decided , however , that it was not worth their while to hew open and disinfect the spaces ; for the foetor would soon be over , and the locality was not one which encouraged fastidious standards .
indeed , there were always vague local tales of unexplained stenches upstairs in the just after and hallowmass .
the neighbours acquiesced in the inertia but the foetor none the less formed an additional count against the place .
toward the last the house was condemned as a habitation by the building inspector .
gilman dreams and their attendant circumstances have never been explained .
elwood , whose thoughts on the entire episode are sometimes almost maddening , came back to college the next autumn and was graduated in the following june .
he found the spectral gossip of the town much diminished , and it is indeed a fact that notwithstanding certain reports of a ghostly tittering in the deserted house which lasted almost as long as that edifice itself no fresh appearances either of old keziah or of brown jenkin have been muttered of since gilman death .
it is rather fortunate that elwood was not in arkham in that later year when certain events abruptly renewed the local whispers about elder horrors .
of course he heard about the matter afterward and suffered untold torments of black and bewildered speculation ; but even that was not as bad as actual nearness and several possible sights would have been .
in march , , a gale wrecked the roof and great chimney of the vacant , so that a chaos of crumbling bricks , blackened , shingles , and rotting planks and timbers crashed down into the loft and broke through the floor beneath .
the whole attic storey was choked with debris from above , but no one took the trouble to touch the mess before the inevitable razing of the decrepit structure .
that ultimate step came in the following december , and it was when gilman old room was cleared out by reluctant , apprehensive workmen that the gossip began .
among the rubbish which had crashed through the ancient slanting ceiling were several things which made the workmen pause and call in the police .
later the police in turn called in the coroner and several professors from the university .
there were bones badly crushed and splintered , but clearly recognizable as human whose manifestly modern date conflicted puzzlingly with the remote period at which their only possible lurking place , the low , loft overhead , had supposedly been sealed from all human access .
the coroner physician decided that some belonged to a small child , while certain others found mixed with shreds of rotten brownish cloth belonged to a rather undersized , bent female of advanced years .
careful sifting of debris also disclosed many tiny bones of rats caught in the collapse , as well as older gnawed by small fangs in a fashion now and then highly productive of controversy and reflection .
other objects found included the mangled fragments of many books and papers , together with a yellowish dust left from the total disintegration of still older books and papers .
all , without exception , appeared to deal with black magic in its most advanced and horrible forms ; and the evidently recent date of certain items is still a mystery as unsolved as that of the modern human bones .
an even greater mystery is the absolute homogeneity of the crabbed , archaic writing found on a wide range of papers whose conditions and watermarks suggest age differences of at least one hundred and fifty to two hundred years .
to some , though , the greatest mystery of all is the variety of utterly inexplicable objects objects whose shapes , materials , types of workmanship , and purposes baffle all conjecture found scattered amidst the wreckage in evidently diverse states of injury .
one of these things which excited several miskatonic professors profoundly is a badly damaged monstrosity plainly resembling the strange image which gilman gave to the college museum , save that it is large , wrought of some peculiar bluish stone instead of metal , and possessed of a singularly angled pedestal with undecipherable hieroglyphics .
archaeologists and anthropologists are still trying to explain the bizarre designs chased on a crushed bowl of light metal whose inner side bore ominous brownish stains when found .
foreigners and credulous grandmothers are equally garrulous about the modern nickel crucifix with broken chain mixed in the rubbish and shiveringly identified by joe maturewicz as that which he had given poor gilman many years before .
some believe this crucifix was dragged up to the sealed loft by rats , while others think it must have been on the floor in some corner of gilman old room at the time .
still others , including joe himself , have theories too wild and fantastic for sober credence .
when the slanting wall of gilman room was torn out , the triangular space between that partition and the house north wall was found to contain much less structural debris , even in proportion to its size , than the room itself , though it had a ghastly layer of older materials which paralyzed the wreckers with horror .
in brief , the floor was a veritable ossuary of the bones of small children some fairly modern , but others extending back in infinite gradations to a period so remote that crumbling was almost complete .
on this deep bony layer rested a knife of great size , obvious antiquity , and grotesque , ornate , and exotic design above which the debris was piled .
in the midst of this debris , wedged between a fallen plank and a cluster of cemented bricks from the ruined chimney , was an object destined to cause more bafflement , veiled fright , and openly superstitious talk in arkham than anything else discovered in the haunted and accursed building .
this object was the partly crushed skeleton of a huge diseased rat , whose abnormalities of form are still a topic of debate and source of singular reticence among the members of miskatonic department of comparative anatomy .
very little concerning this skeleton has leaked out , but the workmen who found it whisper in shocked tones about the long , brownish hairs with which it was associated .
the bones of the tiny paws , it is rumoured , imply prehensile characteristics more typical of a diminutive monkey than of a rat , while the small skull with its savage yellow fangs is of the utmost anomalousness , appearing from certain angles like a miniature , monstrously degraded parody of a human skull .
the workmen crossed themselves in fright when they came upon this blasphemy , but later burned candles of gratitude in stanislaus ' church because of the shrill , ghostly tittering they felt they would never hear again .
i have seen the dark universe yawning where the black planets roll without aim , where they roll in their horror unheeded , without knowledge or lustre or name .
cautious investigators will hesitate to challenge the common belief that robert blake was killed by lightning , or by some profound nervous shock derived from an electrical discharge .
it is true that the window he faced was unbroken , but nature has shown herself capable of many freakish performances .
the expression on his face may easily have arisen from some obscure muscular source unrelated to anything he saw , while the entries in his diary are clearly the result of a fantastic imagination aroused by certain local superstitions and by certain old matters he had uncovered .
as for the anomalous conditions at the deserted church of federal hill the shrewd analyst is not slow in attributing them to some charlatanry , conscious or unconscious , with at least some of which blake was secretly connected .
for after all , the victim was a writer and painter wholly devoted to the field of myth , dream , terror , and superstition , and avid in his quest for scenes and effects of a bizarre , spectral sort .
his earlier stay in the city a visit to a strange old man as deeply given to occult and forbidden lore as he had ended amidst death and flame , and it must have been some morbid instinct which drew him back from his home in milwaukee .
he may have known of the old stories despite his statements to the contrary in the diary , and his death may have nipped in the bud some stupendous hoax destined to have a literary reflection .
among those , however , who have examined and correlated all this evidence , there remain several who cling to less rational and commonplace theories .
they are inclined to take much of blake diary at its face value , and point significantly to certain facts such as the undoubted genuineness of the old church record , the verified existence of the disliked and unorthodox starry wisdom sect prior to , the recorded disappearance of an inquisitive reporter named edwin lillibridge in , and above all the look of monstrous , transfiguring fear on the face of the young writer when he died .
it was one of these believers who , moved to fanatical extremes , threw into the bay the curiously angled stone and its strangely adorned metal box found in the old church steeple the black windowless steeple , and not the tower where blake diary said those things originally were .
though widely censured both officially and unofficially , this man a reputable physician with a taste for odd folklore averred that he had rid the earth of something too dangerous to rest upon it .
between these two schools of opinion the reader must judge for himself .
the papers have given the tangible details from a sceptical angle , leaving for others the drawing of the picture as robert blake saw it or thought he saw it or pretended to see it .
now studying the diary closely , dispassionately , and at leisure , let us summarize the dark chain of events from the expressed point of view of their chief actor .
young blake returned to providence in the winter of , taking the upper floor of a venerable dwelling in a grassy court off college street on the crest of the great eastward hill near the brown university campus and behind the marble john hay library .
it was a cosy and fascinating place , in a little garden oasis of antiquity where huge , friendly cats sunned themselves atop a convenient shed .
the square georgian house had a monitor roof , classic doorway with fan carving , windows , and all the other earmarks of early nineteenth century workmanship .
inside were doors , wide , a curving colonial staircase , white mantels , and a rear set of rooms three steps below the general level .
blake study , a large southwest chamber , overlooked the front garden on one side , while its west windows before one of which he had his desk faced off from the brow of the hill and commanded a splendid view of the lower town outspread roofs and of the mystical sunsets that flamed behind them .
on the far horizon were the open countryside purple slopes .
against these , some two miles away , rose the spectral hump of federal hill , bristling with huddled roofs and steeples whose remote outlines wavered mysteriously , taking fantastic forms as the smoke of the city swirled up and enmeshed them .
blake had a curious sense that he was looking upon some unknown , ethereal world which might or might not vanish in dream if ever he tried to seek it out and enter it in person .
having sent home for most of his books , blake bought some antique furniture suitable for his quarters and settled down to write and paint living alone , and attending to the simple housework himself .
his studio was in a north attic room , where the panes of the monitor roof furnished admirable lighting .
during that first winter he produced five of his short stories the burrower beneath , the stairs in the crypt , shaggai , in the vale of pnath , and the feaster from the stars and painted seven canvases ; studies of nameless , unhuman monsters , and profoundly alien , landscapes .
at sunset he would often sit at his desk and gaze dreamily off at the outspread west the dark towers of memorial hall just below , the georgian belfry , the lofty pinnacles of the downtown section , and that shimmering , mound in the distance whose unknown streets and labyrinthine gables so potently provoked his fancy .
from his few local aquaintances he learned that the slope was a vast italian quarter , though most of the houses were remnant of older yankee and irish days .
now and then he would train his on that spectral , unreachable world beyond the curling smoke ; picking out individual roofs and chimneys and steeples , and speculating upon the bizarre and curious mysteries they might house .
even with optical aid federal hill seemed somehow alien , half fabulous , and linked to the unreal , intangible marvels of blake own tales and pictures .
the feeling would persist long after the hill had faded into the violet , twilight , and the floodlights and the red industrial trust beacon had blazed up to make the night grotesque .
of all the distant objects on federal hill , a certain huge , dark church most fascinated blake .
it stood out with especial distinctness at certain hours of the day , and at sunset the great tower and tapering steeple loomed blackly against the flaming sky .
it seemed to rest on especially high ground ; for the grimy façade , and the obliquely seen north side with sloping roof and the tops of great pointed windows , rose boldly above the tangle of surrounding ridgepoles and .
peculiarly grim and austere , it appeared to be built of stone , stained and weathered with the smoke and storms of a century and more .
the style , so far as the glass could show , was that earliest experimental form of gothic revival which preceded the stately upjohn period and held over some of the outlines and proportions of the georgian age .
perhaps it was reared around or .
as months passed , blake watched the , forbidding structure with an oddly mounting interest .
since the vast windows were never lighted , he knew that it must be vacant .
the longer he watched , the more his imagination worked , till at length he began to fancy curious things .
he believed that a vague , singular aura of desolation hovered over the place , so that even the pigeons and swallows shunned its smoky eaves .
around other towers and belfries his glass would reveal great flocks of birds , but here they never rested .
at least , that is what he thought and set down in his diary .
he pointed the place out to several friends , but none of them had even been on federal hill or possessed the faintest notion of what the church was or had been .
in the spring a deep restlessness gripped blake .
he had begun his novel based on a supposed survival of the in maine but was strangely unable to make progress with it .
more and more he would sit at his westward window and gaze at the distant hill and the black , frowning steeple shunned by the birds .
when the delicate leaves came out on the garden boughs the world was filled with a new beauty , but blake restlessness was merely increased .
it was then that he first thought of crossing the city and climbing bodily up that fabulous slope into the world of dream .
late in april , just before the walpurgis time , blake made his first trip into the unknown .
plodding through the endless downtown streets and the bleak , decayed squares beyond , he came finally upon the ascending avenue of steps , sagging doric porches , and cupolas which he felt must lead up to the , unreachable world beyond the mists .
there were dingy street signs which meant nothing to him , and presently he noted the strange , dark faces of the drifting crowds , and the foreign signs over curious shops in brown , buildings .
nowhere could he find any of the objects he had seen from afar ; so that once more he half fancied that the federal hill of that distant view was a never to be trod by living human feet .
now and then a battered church façade or crumbling spire came in sight , but never the blackened pile that he sought .
when he asked a shopkeeper about a great stone church the man smiled and shook his head , though he spoke english freely .
as blake climbed higher , the region seemed stranger and stranger , with bewildering mazes of brooding brown alleys leading eternally off to the south .
he crossed two or three broad avenues , and once thought he glimpsed a familiar tower .
again he asked a merchant about the massive church of stone , and this time he could have sworn that the plea of ignorance was feigned .
the dark man face had a look of fear which he tried to hide , and blake saw him make a curious sign with his right hand .
then suddenly a black spire stood out against the cloudy sky on his left , above the tiers of brown roofs lining the tangled southerly alleys .
blake knew at once what it was , and plunged toward it through the squalid , unpaved lanes that climbed from the avenue .
twice he lost his way , but he somehow dared not ask any of the patriarchs or housewives who sat on their doorsteps , or any of the children who shouted and played in the mud of the shadowy lanes .
at last he saw the tower plain against the southwest , and a huge stone bulk rose darkly at the end of an alley .
presently he stood in a open square , quaintly cobblestoned , with a high bank wall on the farther side .
this was the end of his quest ; for upon the wide , , plateau which the wall supported a separate , lesser world raised fully six feet above the surrounding streets there stood a grim , titan bulk whose identity , despite blake new perspective , was beyond dispute .
the vacant church was in a state of great decrepitude .
some of the high stone buttresses had fallen , and several delicate finials lay half lost among the brown , neglected weeds and grasses .
the sooty gothic windows were largely unbroken , though many of the stone mullions were missing .
blake wondered how the obscurely painted panes could have survived so well , in view of the known habits of small boys the world over .
the massive doors were intact and tightly closed .
around the top of the bank wall , fully enclosing the grounds , was a rusty iron fence whose gate at the head of a flight of steps from the square was visibly padlocked .
the path from the gate to the building was completely overgrown .
desolation and decay hung like a pall above the place , and in the birdless eaves and black , ivyless walls blake felt a touch of the dimly sinister beyond his power to define .
there were very few people in the square , but blake saw a policeman at the northerly end and approached him with questions about the church .
he was a great wholesome irishman , and it seemed odd that he would do little more than make the sign of the cross and mutter that people never spoke of that building .
when blake pressed him he said very hurriedly that the italian priest warned everybody against it , vowing that a monstrous evil had once dwelt there and left its mark .
he himself had heard dark whispers of it from his father , who recalled certain sounds and rumours from his boyhood .
there had been a bad sect there in the old days an outlaw sect that called up awful things from some unknown gulf of night .
it had taken a good priest to exorcise what had come , though there did be those who said that merely the light could do it .
if father were alive there would be many a thing he could tell .
but now there was nothing to do but let it alone .
it hurt nobody now , and those that owned it were dead or far away .
they had run away like rats after the threatening talk in , when people began to mind the way folks vanished now and then in the neighbourhood .
some day the city would step in and take the property for lack of heirs , but little good would come of anybody touching it .
better it be left alone for the years to topple , lest things be stirred that ought to rest forever in their black abyss .
after the policeman had gone blake stood staring at the sullen steepled pile .
it excited him to find that the structure seemed as sinister to others as to him , and he wondered what grain of truth might lie behind the old tales the bluecoat had repeated .
probably they were mere legends evoked by the evil look of the place , but even so , they were like a strange coming to life of one of his own stories .
the afternoon sun came out from behind dispersing clouds , but seemed unable to light up the stained , sooty walls of the old temple that towered on its high plateau .
it was odd that the green of spring had not touched the brown , withered growths in the raised , yard .
blake found himself edging nearer the raised area and examining the bank wall and rusted fence for possible avenues of ingress .
there was a terrible lure about the blackened fane which was not to be resisted .
the fence had no opening near the steps , but round on the north side were some missing bars .
he could go up the steps and walk round on the narrow coping outside the fence till he came to the gap .
if the people feared the place so wildly , he would encounter no interference .
he was on the embankment and almost inside the fence before anyone noticed him .
then , looking down , he saw the few people in the square edging away and making the same sign with their right hands that the shopkeeper in the avenue had made .
several windows were slammed down , and a fat woman darted into the street and pulled some small children inside a rickety , unpainted house .
the gap in the fence was very easy to pass through , and before long blake found himself wading amidst the rotting , tangled growths of the deserted yard .
here and there the worn stump of a headstone told him that there had once been burials in the field ; but that , he saw , must have been very long ago .
the sheer bulk of the church was oppressive now that he was close to it , but he conquered his mood and approached to try the three great doors in the façade .
all were securely locked , so he began a circuit of the cyclopean building in quest of some minor and more penetrable opening .
even then he could not be sure that he wished to enter that haunt of desertion and shadow , yet the pull of its strangeness dragged him on automatically .
a yawning and unprotected cellar window in the rear furnished the needed aperture .
peering in , blake saw a subterrene gulf of cobwebs and dust faintly litten by the western sun filtered rays .
debris , old barrels , and ruined boxes and furniture of numerous sorts met his eye , though over everything lay a shroud of dust which softened all sharp outlines .
the rusted remains of a furnace showed that the building had been used and kept in shape as late as times .
acting almost without conscious initiative , blake crawled through the window and let himself down to the and concrete floor .
the vaulted cellar was a vast one , without partitions ; and in a corner far to the right , amid dense shadows , he saw a black archway evidently leading upstairs .
he felt a peculiar sense of oppression at being actually within the great spectral building , but kept it in check as he cautiously scouted about finding a barrel amid the dust , and rolling it over to the open window to provide for his exit .
then , bracing himself , he crossed the wide , space toward the arch .
with the omnipresent dust , and covered with ghostly gossamer fibres , he reached and began to climb the worn stone steps which rose into the darkness .
he had no light , but groped carefully with his hands .
after a sharp turn he felt a closed door ahead , and a little fumbling revealed its ancient latch .
it opened inward , and beyond it he saw a dimly illumined corridor lined with panelling .
once on the ground floor , blake began exploring in a rapid fashion .
all the inner doors were unlocked , so that he freely passed from room to room .
the colossal nave was an almost eldritch place with its drifts and mountains of dust over box pews , altar , pulpit , and and its titanic ropes of cobweb stretching among the pointed arches of the gallery and entwining the clustered gothic columns .
over all this hushed desolation played a hideous leaden light as the declining afternoon sun sent its rays through the strange , panes of the great apsidal windows .
the paintings on those windows were so obscured by soot that blake could scarcely decipher what they had represented , but from the little he could make out he did not like them .
the designs were largely conventional , and his knowledge of obscure symbolism told him much concerning some of the ancient patterns .
the few saints depicted bore expressions distinctly open to criticism , while one of the windows seemed to show merely a dark space with spirals of curious luminosity scattered about in it .
turning away from the windows , blake noticed that the cobwebbed cross above the altar was not of the ordinary kind , but resembled the primordial ankh or crux ansata of shadowy egypt .
in a rear vestry room beside the apse blake found a rotting desk and shelves of mildewed , disintegrating books .
here for the first time he received a positive shock of objective horror , for the titles of those books told him much .
they were the black , forbidden things which most sane people have never even heard of , or have heard of only in furtive , timorous whispers ; the banned and dreaded repositories of equivocal secret and immemorial formulae which have trickled down the stream of time from the days of man youth , and the dim , fabulous days before man was .
he had himself read many of them a latin version of the abhorred necronomicon , the sinister liber ivonis , the infamous cultes des goules of comte , the unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt , and old ludvig prinn hellish de vermis mysteriis .
but there were others he had known merely by reputation or not at all the pnakotic manuscripts , the book of dzyan , and a crumbling volume of wholly unidentifiable characters yet with certain symbols and diagrams shuddering recognizable to the occult student .
clearly , the lingering local rumours had not lied .
this place had once been the seat of an evil older than mankind and wider than the known universe .
in the ruined desk was a small leatherbound filled with entries in some odd cryptographic medium .
the manuscript writing consisted of the common traditional symbols used today in astronomy and anciently in alchemy , astrology , and other dubious arts the devices of the sun , moon , planets , aspects , and zodiacal signs here massed in solid pages of text , with divisions and paragraphings suggesting that each symbol answered to some alphabetical letter .
in the hope of later solving the cryptogram , blake bore off this volume in his coat pocket .
many of the great tomes on the shelves fascinated him unutterably , and he felt tempted to borrow them at some later time .
he wondered how they could have remained undisturbed so long .
was he the first to conquer the clutching , pervasive fear which had for nearly sixty years protected this deserted place from visitors ?
having now thoroughly explored the ground floor , blake ploughed again through the dust of the spectral nave to the front vestibule , where he had seen a door and staircase presumably leading up to the blackened tower and steeple objects so long familiar to him at a distance .
the ascent was a choking experience , for dust lay thick , while the spiders had done their worst in this constricted place .
the staircase was a spiral with high , narrow wooden treads , and now and then blake passed a clouded window looking dizzily out over the city .
though he had seen no ropes below , he expected to find a bell or peal of bells in the tower whose narrow , lancet windows his had studied so often .
here he was doomed to disappointment ; for when he attained the top of the stairs he found the tower chamber vacant of chimes , and clearly devoted to vastly different purposes .
the room , about fifteen feet square , was faintly lighted by four lancet windows , one on each side , which were glazed within their screening of decayed .
these had been further fitted with tight , opaque screens , but the latter were now largely rotted away .
in the centre of the floor rose a curiously angled stone pillar dome four feet in height and two in average diameter , covered on each side with bizarre , crudely incised and wholly unrecognizable hieroglyphs .
on this pillar rested a metal box of peculiarly asymmetrical form ; its hinged lid thrown back , and its interior holding what looked beneath the dust to be an or irregularly spherical object some four inches through .
around the pillar in a rough circle were seven gothic chairs still largely intact , while behind them , ranging along the walls , were seven colossal images of crumbling , plaster , resembling more than anything else the cryptic carven megaliths of mysterious easter island .
in one corner of the cobwebbed chamber a ladder was built into the wall , leading up to the closed trap door of the windowless steeple above .
as blake grew accustomed to the feeble light he noticed odd on the strange open box of yellowish metal .
approaching , he tried to clear the dust away with his hands and handkerchief , and saw that the figurings were of a monstrous and utterly alien kind ; depicting entities which , though seemingly alive , resembled no known ever evolved on this planet .
the seeming sphere turned out to be a nearly black , polyhedron with many irregular flat surfaces ; either a very remarkable crystal of some sort or an artificial object of carved and highly polished mineral matter .
it did not touch the bottom of the box , but was held suspended by means of a metal band around its centre , with seven supports extending horizontally to angles of the box inner wall near the top .
this stone , once exposed , exerted upon blake an almost alarming fascination .
he could scarcely tear his eyes from it , and as he looked at its glistening surfaces he almost fancied it was transparent , with worlds of wonder within .
into his mind floated pictures of alien orbs with great stone towers , and other orbs with titan mountains and no mark of life , and still remoter spaces where only a stirring in vague blacknesses told of the presence of consciousness and will .
when he did look away , it was to notice a somewhat singular mound of dust in the far corner near the ladder to the steeple .
just why it took his attention he could not tell , but something in its contours carried a message to his unconscious mind .
ploughing toward it , and brushing aside the hanging cobwebs as he went , he began to discern something grim about it .
hand and handkerchief soon revealed the truth , and blake gasped with a baffling mixture of emotions .
it was a human skeleton , and it must have been there for a very long time .
the clothing was in shreds , but some buttons and fragments of cloth bespoke a man grey suit .
there were other bits of evidence shoes , metal clasps , huge buttons for round cuffs , a stickpin of bygone pattern , a reporter badge with the name of the old providence telegram , and a crumbling leather pocketbook .
blake examined the latter with care , finding within it several bills of antiquated issue , a celluloid advertising calendar for , some cards with the name edwin lillibridge , and a paper covered with pencilled memoranda .
this paper held much of a puzzling nature , and blake read it carefully at the dim westward window .
its disjointed text included such phrases as the following enoch bowen home from egypt may buys old church in july his archaeological work studies in occult well known .

restoring the paper to the pocketbook and placing the latter in his coat , blake turned to look down at the skeleton in the dust .
the implications of the notes were clear , and there could be no doubt but that this man had come to the deserted edifice years before in quest of a newspaper sensation which no one else had been bold enough to attempt .
perhaps no one else had known of his plan who could tell ?
but he had never returned to his paper .
had some fear risen to overcome him and bring on sudden ?
blake stooped over the gleaming bones and noted their peculiar state .
some of them were badly scattered , and a few seemed oddly dissolved at the ends .
others were strangely yellowed , with vague suggestions of charring .
this charring extended to some of the fragments of clothing .
the skull was in a very peculiar state stained yellow , and with a charred aperture in the top as if some powerful acid had eaten through the solid bone .
what had happened to the skeleton during its four decades of silent entombment here blake could not imagine .
before he realized it , he was looking at the stone again , and letting its curious influence call up a nebulous pageantry in his mind .
he saw processions of robed , hooded figures whose outlines were not human , and looked on endless leagues of desert lined with carved , monoliths .
he saw towers and walls in nighted depths under the sea , and vortices of space where wisps of black mist floated before thin shimmerings of cold purple haze .
and beyond all else he glimpsed an infinite gulf of darkness , where solid and semisolid forms were known only by their windy stirrings , and cloudy patterns of force seemed to superimpose order on chaos and hold forth a key to all the paradoxes and arcana of the worlds we know .
then all at once the spell was broken by an access of gnawing , indeterminate panic fear .
blake choked and turned away from the stone , conscious of some formless alien presence close to him and watching him with horrible intentness .
he felt entangled with something something which was not in the stone , but which had looked through it at him something which would ceaselessly follow him with a cognition that was not physical sight .
plainly , the place was getting on his nerves as well it might in view of his gruesome find .
the light was waning , too , and since he had no illuminant with him he knew he would have to be leaving soon .
it was then , in the gathering twilight , that he thought he saw a faint trace of luminosity in the crazily angled stone .
he had tried to look away from it , but some obscure compulsion drew his eyes hack .
was there a subtle phosphorescence of about the thing ?
what was it that the dead man notes had said concerning a shining trapezohedron ?
what , anyway , was this abandoned lair of cosmic evil ?
what had been done here , and what might still be lurking in the shadows ?
it seemed now as if an elusive touch of foetor had arisen somewhere close by , though its source was not apparent .
blake seized the cover of the box and snapped it down .
it moved easily on its alien hinges , and closed completely over the unmistakably glowing stone .
at the sharp click of that closing a soft stirring sound seemed to come from the steeple eternal blackness overhead , beyond the .
rats , without question the only living things to reveal their presence in this accursed pile since he had entered it .
and yet that stirring in the steeple frightened him horribly , so that he plunged almost wildly down the spiral stairs , across the ghoulish nave , into the vaulted basement , out amidst the gathering dust of the deserted square , and down through the teeming , alleys and avenues of federal hill towards the sane central streets and the brick sidewalks of the college district .
during the days which followed , blake told no one of his expedition .
instead , he read much in certain books , examined long years of newspaper files downtown , and worked feverishly at the cryptogram in that leather volume from the cobwebbed vestry room .
the cipher , he soon saw , was no simple one ; and after a long period of endeavour he felt sure that its language could not be english , latin , greek , french , spanish , italian , or german .
evidently he would have to draw upon the deepest wells of his strange erudition .
every evening the old impulse to gaze westwards returned , and he saw the black steeple as of yore amongst the bristling roofs of a distant and world .
but now it held a fresh note of terror for him .
he knew the heritage of evil lore it masked , and with the knowledge his vision ran riot in queer new ways .
the birds of spring were returning , and as he watched their sunset flights he fancied they avoided the gaunt , lone spire as never before .
when a flock of them approached it , he thought , they would wheel and scatter in panic confusion and he could guess at the wild twitterings which failed to reach him across the intervening miles .
it was in june that blake diary told of his victory over the cryptogram .
the text was , he found , in the dark aklo language used by certain cults of evil antiquity , and known to him in a halting way through previous researches .
the diary is strangely reticent about what blake deciphered , but he was patently awed and disconcerted by his results .
there are references to a haunter of the dark awaked by gazing into the shining trapezohedron , and insane conjectures about the black gulfs of chaos from which it was called .
the being is spoken of as holding all knowledge , and demanding monstrous sacrifices .
some of blake entries show fear lest the thing , which he seemed to regard as summoned , stalk abroad ; though he adds that the streetlights form a bulwark which can not be crossed .
of the shining trapezohedron he speaks often , calling it a window on all time and space , and tracing its history from the days it was fashioned on dark yuggoth , before ever the old ones brought it to earth .
it was treasured and placed in its curious box by the crinoid things of antarctica , salvaged from their ruins by the of valusia , and peered at aeons later in lemuria by the first human beings .
it crossed strange lands and stranger seas , and sank with atlantis before a minoan fisher meshed it in his net and sold it to swarthy merchants from nighted khem .
the pharaoh built around it a temple with a windowless crypt , and did that which caused his name to be stricken from all monuments and records .
then it slept in the ruins of that evil fane which the priests and the new pharaoh destroyed , till the delver spade once more brought it forth to curse mankind .
early in july the newspapers oddly supplement blake entries , though in so brief and casual a way that only the diary has called general attention to their contribution .
it appears that a new fear had been growing on federal hill since a stranger had entered the dreaded church .
the italians whispered of unaccustomed stirrings and bumpings and scrapings in the dark windowless steeple , and called on their priests to banish an entity which haunted their dreams .
something , they said , was constantly watching at a door to see if it were dark enough to venture forth .
press items mentioned the longstanding local superstitions , but failed to shed much light on the earlier background of the horror .
it was obvious that the young reporters of today are no antiquarians .
in writing of these things in his diary , blake expresses a curious kind of remorse , and talks of the duty of burying the shining trapezohedron and of banishing what he had evoked by letting daylight into the hideous jutting spire .
at the same time , however , he displays the dangerous extent of his fascination , and admits a morbid longing pervading even his dreams to visit the accursed tower and gaze again into the cosmic secrets of the glowing stone .
then something in the journal on the morning of july threw the diarist into a veritable fever of horror .
it was only a variant of the other items about the federal hill restlessness , but to blake it was somehow very terrible indeed .
in the night a thunderstorm had put the city out of commission for a full hour , and in that black interval the italians had nearly gone mad with fright .
those living near the dreaded church had sworn that the thing in the steeple had taken advantage of the street lamps ' absence and gone down into the body of the church , flopping and bumping around in a viscous , altogether dreadful way .
towards the last it had bumped up to the tower , where there were sounds of the shattering of glass .
it could go wherever the darkness reached , but light would always send it fleeing .
when the current blazed on again there had been a shocking commotion in the tower , for even the feeble light trickling through the , windows was too much for the thing .
it had bumped and slithered up into its tenebrous steeple just in time for a long dose of light would have sent it back into the abyss whence the crazy stranger had called it .
during the dark hour praying crowds had clustered round the church in the rain with lighted candles and lamps somehow shielded with folded paper and umbrellas a guard of light to save the city from the nightmare that stalks in darkness .
once , those nearest the church declared , the outer door had rattled hideously .
but even this was not the worst .
that evening in the bulletin blake read of what the reporters had found .
aroused at last to the whimsical news value of the scare , a pair of them had defied the frantic crowds of italians and crawled into the church through the cellar window after trying the doors in vain .
they found the dust of the vestibule and of the spectral nave ploughed up in a singular way , with pits of rotted cushions and satin scattered curiously around .
there was a bad odour everywhere , and here and there were bits of yellow stain and patches of what looked like charring .
opening the door to the tower , and pausing a moment at the suspicion of a scraping sound above , they found the narrow spiral stairs wiped roughly clean .
in the tower itself a similarly condition existed .
they spoke of the heptagonal stone pillar , the overturned gothic chairs , and the bizarre plaster images ; though strangely enough the metal box and the old mutilated skeleton were not mentioned .
what disturbed blake the most except for the hints of stains and charring and bad odours was the final detail that explained the crashing glass .
every one of the tower lancet windows was broken , and two of them had been darkened in a crude and hurried way by the stuffing of satin and into the spaces between the slanting exterior .
more satin fragments and bunches of horsehair lay scattered around the newly swept floor , as if someone had been interrupted in the act of restoring the tower to the absolute blackness of its tightly curtained days .
yellowish stains and charred patches were found on the ladder to the windowless spire , but when a reporter climbed up , opened the and shot a feeble flashlight beam into the black and strangely foetid space , he saw nothing but darkness , and a heterogeneous litter of shapeless fragments near the aperture .
the verdict , of course , was charlatanry .
somebody had played a joke on the superstitious , or else some fanatic had striven to bolster up their fears for their own supposed good .
or perhaps some of the younger and more sophisticated dwellers had staged an elaborate hoax on the outside world .
there was an amusing aftermath when the police sent an officer to verify the reports .
three men in succession found ways of evading the assignment , and the fourth went very reluctantly and returned very soon without adding to the account given by the reporters .
from this point onwards blake diary shows a mounting tide of insidious horror and nervous apprehension .
he upbraids himself for not doing something , and speculates wildly on the consequences of another electrical breakdown .
it had been verified that on three occasions during thunderstorms he telephoned the electric light company in a frantic vein and asked that desperate precautions against a lapse of power be taken .
now and then his entries show concern over the failure of the reporters to find the metal box and stone , and the strangely marred old skeleton , when they explored the shadowy tower room .
he assumed that these things had been removed whither , and by whom or what , he could only guess .
but his worst fears concerned himself , and the kind of unholy rapport he felt to exist between his mind and that lurking horror in the distant steeple that monstrous thing of night which his rashness had called out of the ultimate black spaces .
he seemed to feel a constant tugging at his will , and callers of that period remember how he would sit abstractedly at his desk and stare out of the west window at that mound beyond the swirling smoke of the city .
his entries dwell monotonously on certain terrible dreams , and of a strengthening of the unholy rapport in his sleep .
there is mention of a night when he awakened to find himself fully dressed , outdoors , and headed automatically down college hill towards the west .
again and again he dwells on the fact that the thing in the steeple knows where to find him .
the week following july is recalled as the time of blake partial breakdown .
he did not dress , and ordered all his food by telephone .
visitors remarked the cords he kept near his bed , and he said that had forced him to bind his ankles every night with knots which would probably hold or else waken him with the labour of untying .
in his diary he told of the hideous experience which had brought the collapse .
after retiring on the night of the , he had suddenly found himself groping about in an almost black space .
all he could see were short , faint , horizontal streaks of bluish light , but he could smell an overpowering foetor and hear a curious jumble of soft , furtive sounds above him .
whenever he moved he stumbled over something , and at each noise there would come a sort of answering sound from above a vague stirring , mixed with the cautious sliding of wood on wood .
once his groping hands encountered a pillar of stone with a vacant top , whilst later he found himself clutching the rungs of a ladder built into the wall , and fumbling his uncertain way upwards towards some region of intenser stench where a hot , searing blast beat down against him .
before his eyes a kaleidoscopic range of phantasmal images played , all of them dissolving at intervals into the picture of a vast , unplumbed abyss of night wherein whirled suns and worlds of an even profounder blackness .
he thought of the ancient legends of ultimate chaos , at whose centre sprawls the blind idiot god azathoth , lord of all things , encircled by his flopping horde of mindless and amorphous dancers , and lulled by the thin monotonous piping of a demoniac flute held in nameless paws .
then a sharp report from the outer world broke through his stupor and roused him to the unutterable horror of his position .
what it was , he never knew perhaps it was some belated peal from the fireworks heard all summer on federal hill as the dwellers hail their various patron saints , or the saints of their native villages in italy .
in any event he shrieked aloud , dropped frantically from the ladder , and stumbled blindly across the obstructed floor of the almost lightless chamber that encompassed him .
he knew instantly where he was , and plunged recklessly down the narrow spiral staircase , tripping and bruising himself at every turn .
there was a nightmare flight through a vast cobwebbed nave whose ghostly arches reached up to realms of leering shadow , a sightless scramble through a littered basement , a climb to regions of air and street lights outside , and a mad racing down a spectral hill of gibbering gables , across a grim , silent city of tall black towers , and up the steep eastward precipice to his own ancient door .
on regaining consciousness in the morning he found himself lying on his study floor fully dressed .
dirt and cobwebs covered him , and every inch of his body seemed sore and bruised .
when he faced the mirror he saw that his hair was badly scorched while a trace of strange evil odour seemed to cling to his upper outer clothing .
it was then that his nerves broke down .
thereafter , lounging exhaustedly about in a , he did little but stare from his west window , shiver at the threat of thunder , and make wild entries in his diary .
the great storm broke just before midnight on august .
lightning struck repeatedly in all parts of the city , and two remarkable fireballs were reported .
the rain was torrential , while a constant fusillade of thunder brought sleeplessness to thousands .
blake was utterly frantic in his fear for the lighting system , and tried to telephone the company around though by that time service had been temporarily cut off in the interests of safety .
he recorded everything in his diary the large , nervous , and often undecipherable , hieroglyphs telling their own story of growing frenzy and despair , and of entries scrawled blindly in the dark .
he had to keep the house dark in order to see out of the window , and it appears that most of his time was spent at his desk , peering anxiously through the rain across the glistening miles of downtown roofs at the constellation of distant lights marking federal hill .
now and then he would fumblingly make an entry in his diary , so that detached phrases such as the lights must not go ; it knows where i am ; i must destroy it ; and it is calling to me , but perhaps it means no injury this time ; are found scattered down two of the pages .
then the lights went out all over the city .
it happened at according to records , but blake diary gives no indication of the time .
the entry is merely , lights out god help me .
on federal hill there were watchers as anxious as he , and knots of men paraded the square and alleys around the evil church with candles , electric flashlights , oil lanterns , crucifixes , and obscure charms of the many sorts common to southern italy .
they blessed each flash of lightning , and made cryptical signs of fear with their right hands when a turn in the storm caused the flashes to lessen and finally to cease altogether .
a rising wind blew out most of the candles , so that the scene grew threatening dark .
someone roused father merluzzo of spirito santo church , and he hastened to the dismal square to pronounce whatever helpful syllables he could .
of the restless and curious sounds in the blackened tower , there could be no doubt whatever .
for what happened at we have the testimony of the priest , a young , intelligent , and person ; of patrolman william monohan of the central station , an officer of the highest reliability who had paused at that part of his beat to inspect the crowd ; and of most of the men who had gathered around the church high back wall especially those in the square where the eastward façade was visible .
of course there was nothing which can be proved as being outside the order of nature .
the possible causes of such an event are many .
no one can speak with certainty of the obscure chemical processes arising in a vast , ancient , , and building of heterogeneous contents .
mephitic vapours spontaneous combustion pressure of gases born of long decay any one of numberless phenomena might be responsible .
and then , of course , the factor of conscious charlatanry can by no means be excluded .
the thing was really quite simple in itself , and covered less than three minutes of actual time .
father merluzzo , always a precise man , looked at his watch repeatedly .
it started with a definite swelling of the dull fumbling sounds inside the black tower .
there had for some time been a vague exhalation of strange , evil odours from the church , and this had now become emphatic and offensive .
then at last there was a sound of splintering wood and a large , heavy object crashed down in the yard beneath the frowning easterly façade .
the tower was invisible now that the candles would not burn , but as the object neared the ground the people knew that it was the of that tower east window .
immediately afterwards an utterly unbearable foetor welled forth from the unseen heights , choking and sickening the trembling watchers , and almost prostrating those in the square .
at the same time the air trembled with a vibration as of flapping wings , and a sudden wind more violent than any previous blast snatched off the hats and wrenched the dripping umbrellas from the crowd .
nothing definite could be seen in the candleless night , though some spectators thought they glimpsed a great spreading blur of denser blackness against the inky sky something like a formless cloud of smoke that shot with meteorlike speed towards the east .
that was all .
the watchers were half numbed with fright , awe , and discomfort , and scarcely knew what to do , or whether to do anything at all .
not knowing what had happened , they did not relax their vigil ; and a moment later they sent up a prayer as a sharp flash of belated lightning , followed by an earsplitting crash of sound , rent the flooded heavens .
half an hour later the rain stopped , and in fifteen minutes more the street lights sprang on again , sending the weary , bedraggled watchers relievedly back to their homes .
the next day papers gave these matters minor mention in connection with the general storm reports .
it seems that the great lightning flash and deafening explosion which followed the federal hill occurrence were even more tremendous farther east , where a burst of the singular foetor was likewise noticed .
the phenomenon was most marked over college hill , where the crash awakened all the sleeping inhabitants and led to a bewildered round of speculations .
of those who were already awake only a few saw the anomalous blaze of light near the top of the hill , or noticed the inexplicable upward rush of air which almost stripped the leaves from the trees and blasted the plants in the gardens .
it was agreed that the lone , sudden must have struck somewhere in this neighbourhood , though no trace of its striking could afterwards be found .
a youth in the tau omega fraternity house thought he saw a grotesque and hideous mass of smoke in the air just as the preliminary flash burst , but his observation has not been verified .
all of the few observers , however , agree as to the violent gust from the west and the flood of intolerable stench which preceded the belated stroke , whilst evidence concerning the momentary burned odour after the stroke is equally general .
these points were discussed very carefully because of their probable connection with the death of robert blake .
students in the psi delta house , whose upper rear windows looked into blake study , noticed the blurred white face at the westward window on the morning of the ninth , and wondered what was wrong with the expression .
when they saw the same face in the same position that evening , they felt worried , and watched for the lights to come up in his apartment .
later they rang the bell of the darkened flat , and finally had a policeman force the door .
the rigid body sat bolt upright at the desk by the window , and when the intruders saw the glassy , bulging eyes , and the marks of stark , convulsive fright on the twisted features , they turned away in sickened dismay .
shortly afterwards the coroner physician made an examination , and despite the unbroken window reported electrical shock , or nervous tension induced by electrical discharge , as the cause of death .
the hideous expression he ignored altogether , deeming it a not improbable result of the profound shock as experienced by a person of such abnormal imagination and unbalanced emotions .
he deduced these latter qualities from the books , paintings , and manuscripts found in the apartment , and from the blindly scrawled entries in the diary on the desk .
blake had prolonged his frenzied jottings to the last , and the pencil was found clutched in his spasmodically contracted right hand .
the entries after the failure of the lights were highly disjointed , and legible only in part .
from them certain investigators have drawn conclusions differing greatly from the materialistic official verdict , but such speculations have little chance for belief among the conservative .
the case of these imaginative theorists has not been helped by the action of superstitious doctor dexter , who threw the curious box and angled stone an object certainly as seen in the black windowless steeple where it was found into the deepest channel of narragansett bay .
excessive imagination and neurotic unbalance on blake part , aggravated by knowledge of the evil bygone cult whose startling traces he had uncovered , form the dominant interpretation given those final frenzied jottings .
these are the entries or all that can be made of them lights still out must be five minutes now .

i during the winter of officials of the federal government made a strange and secret investigation of certain conditions in the ancient massachusetts seaport of innsmouth .
the public first learned of it in february , when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred , followed by the deliberate burning and dynamiting under suitable precautions of an enormous number of crumbling , , and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront .
uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor .
keener , however , wondered at the prodigious number of arrests , the abnormally large force of men used in making them , and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners .
no trials , or even definite charges were reported ; nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular gaols of the nation .
there were vague statements about disease and concentration camps , and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons , but nothing positive ever developed .
innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated , and it is even now only beginning to show signs of a sluggishly revived existence .
complaints from many liberal organizations were met with long confidential discussions , and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons .
as a result , these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent .
newspaper men were harder to manage , but seemed largely to cooperate with the government in the end .
only one paper a tabloid always discounted because of its wild policy mentioned the deep diving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond devil reef .
that item , gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors , seemed indeed rather ; since the low , black reef lay a full mile and a half out from innsmouth harbour .
people around the country and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves , but said very little to the outer world .
they had talked about dying and innsmouth for nearly a century , and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted at years before .
many things had taught them secretiveness , and there was no need to exert pressure on them .
besides , they really knew little ; for wide salt marshes , desolate and unpeopled , kept neighbors off from innsmouth on the landward side .
but at last i am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing .
results , i am certain , are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified men at innsmouth .
besides , what was found might possibly have more than one explanation .
i do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me , and i have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper .
for my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman , and i have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures .
it was i who fled frantically out of innsmouth in the early morning hours of july , , and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode .
i was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain ; but now that it is an old story , with public interest and curiosity gone , i have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that and seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality .
the mere telling helps me to restore confidence in my own faculties ; to reassure myself that i was not the first to succumb to a contagious nightmare hallucination .
it helps me , too , in making up my mind regarding a certain terrible step which lies ahead of me .
i never heard of innsmouth till the day before i saw it for the first and so far last time .
i was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of new england sightseeing , antiquarian , and genealogical and had planned to go directly from ancient newburyport to arkham , whence my mother family was derived .
i had no car , but was travelling by train , trolley and , always seeking the cheapest possible route .
in newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to arkham ; and it was only at the station , when i demurred at the high fare , that i learned about innsmouth .
the stout , agent , whose speech shewed him to be no local man , seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy , and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered .
you could take that old bus , i suppose , he said with a certain hesitation , but it ai thought much of hereabouts .
it goes through innsmouth you may have heard about that and so the people do like it .
run by an innsmouth fellow joe sargent but never gets any custom from here , or arkham either , i guess .
wonder it keeps running at all .
i it cheap enough , but i never see two or three people in it nobody but those innsmouth folk .
leaves the square front of hammond drug store at and unless they changed lately .
looks like a terrible rattletrap i never been on it .
that was the first i ever heard of shadowed innsmouth .
any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guidebooks would have interested me , and the agent odd manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity .
a town able to inspire such dislike in it its neighbors , i thought , must be at least rather unusual , and worthy of a tourist attention .
if it came before arkham i would stop off there and so i asked the agent to tell me something about it .
he was very deliberate , and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said .
innsmouth ?
well , it a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the manuxet .
used to be almost a city quite a port before the war of but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so .
no railroad now and never went through , and the branch line from rowley was given up years ago .
more empty houses than there are people , i guess , and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering .
everybody trades mostly either here or in arkham or ipswich .
once they had quite a few mills , but nothing left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part time .
that refinery , though , used to be a big thing , and old man marsh , who owns it , must be croesus .
queer old duck , though , and sticks mighty close in his home .
he supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight .
grandson of captain obed marsh , who founded the business .
his mother seems to been some kind of foreigner they say a south sea islander so everybody raised cain when he married an ipswich girl fifty years ago .
they always do that about innsmouth people , and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any innsmouth blood they have in .
but marsh children and grandchildren look just like anyone else far i can see .
i had pointed out to me here though , come to think of it , the elder children do seem to be around lately .
never saw the old man .
and why is everybody so down on innsmouth ?
well , young fellow , you must take too much stock in what people here say .
they hard to get started , but once they do get started they never let up .
they been telling things about innsmouth whispering , mostly for the last hundred years , i guess , and i gather they more scared than anything else .
some of the stories would make you laugh about old captain marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in innsmouth , or about some kind of and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around or thereabouts but i come from panton , vermont , and that kind of story do go down with me .
you ought to hear , though , what some of the tell about the black reef off the coast devil reef , they call it .
it well above water a good part of the time , and never much below it , but at that you could hardly call it an island .
the story is that there a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reef sprawled about , or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top .
it a rugged , uneven thing , a good bit over a mile out , and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it .
that is , sailors that did hail from innsmouth .
one of the things they had against old captain marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was right .
maybe he did , for i dare say the rock formation was interesting , and it just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it ; but there was talk of his dealing with demons there .
fact is , i guess on the whole it was really the captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef .
that was before the big epidemic of , when over half the folks in innsmouth was carried off .
they never did quite figure out what the trouble was , but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from china or somewhere by the shipping .
it surely was bad enough there was riots over it , and all sorts of ghastly doings that i do believe ever got outside of town and it left the place in awful shape .
never came back there ca be more or people living there now .
but the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice and i do say i blaming those that hold it .
i hate those innsmouth folks myself , and i would care to go to their town .
i you know though i can see you a westerner by your talk what a lot our new england ships used to have to do with queer ports in africa , asia , the south seas , and everywhere else , and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with .
you probably heard about the salem man that came home with a chinese wife , and maybe you know there still a bunch of fiji islanders somewhere around cape cod .
well , there must be something like that back of the innsmouth people .
the place always was badly cut off from the rest of the country by marshes and creeks and we ca be sure about the ins and outs of the matter ; but it pretty clear that old captain marsh must have brought home some odd specimens when he had all three of his ships in commission back in the twenties and thirties .
there certainly is a strange kind of streak in the innsmouth folks today i do know how to explain it but it sort of makes you crawl .
you notice a little in sargent if you take his bus .
some of have queer narrow heads with flat noses and bulgy , stary eyes that never seem to shut , and their skin ai quite right .
rough and scabby , and the sides of the necks are all shriveled or creased up .
get bald , too , very young .
the older fellows look the worst fact is , i do believe i ever seen a very old chap of that kind .
guess they must die of looking in the glass !
animals hate they used to have lots of horse trouble before the autos came in .
nobody around here or in arkham or ipswich will have anything to do with , and they act kind of offish themselves when they come to town or when anyone tries to fish on their grounds .
queer how fish are always thick off innsmouth harbour when there ai any anywhere else around but just try to fish there yourself and see how the folks chase you off !
those people used to come here on the railroad walking and taking the train at rowley after the branch was dropped but now they use that bus .
yes , there a hotel in innsmouth called the gilman house but i do believe it can amount to much .
i would advise you to try it .
better stay over here and take the ten bus tomorrow morning ; then you can get an evening bus there for arkham at eight .
there was a factory inspector who stopped at the gilman a couple of years ago and he had a lot of unpleasant hints about the place .
seems they get a queer crowd there , for this fellow heard voices in other rooms though most of was empty that gave him the shivers .
it was foreign talk he thought , but he said the bad thing about it was the kind of voice that sometimes spoke .
it sounded so unnatural slopping like , he said that he did dare undress and go to sleep .
just waited up and lit out the first thing in the morning .
the talk went on most all night .
this fellow casey , his name was had a lot to say about how the innsmouth folk watched him and seemed kind of on guard .
he found the marsh refinery a queer place it in an old mill on the lower falls of the manuxet .
what he said tallied up with what i heard .
books in bad shape , and no clear account of any kind of dealings .
you know it always been a kind of mystery where the marshes get the gold they refine .
they never seemed to do much buying in that line , but years ago they shipped out an enormous lot of ingots .
used to be talk of a queer foreign kind of jewelry that the sailors and refinery men sometimes sold on the sly , or that was seen once or twice on some of the marsh .
people allowed maybe old captain obed traded for it in some heathen port , especially since he always ordered stacks of glass beads and trinkets such as seafaring men used to get for native trade .
others thought and still think he found an old pirate cache out on devil reef .
but here a funny thing .
the old captain been dead these sixty years , and there ai been a ship out of the place since the civil war ; but just the same the marshes still keep on buying a few of those native trade things mostly glass and rubber gewgaws , they tell me .
maybe the innsmouth folks like to look at themselves gawd knows they gotten to be about as bad as south sea cannibals and guinea savages .
that plague of must have taken off the best blood in the place .
anyway , they a doubtful lot now , and the marshes and other rich folks are as bad as any .
as i told you , there probably ai more people in the whole town in spite of all the streets they say there are .
i guess they what they call trash ' down south lawless and sly , and full of secret things .
they get a lot of fish and lobsters and do exporting by truck .
queer how the fish swarm right there and nowhere else .
nobody can ever keep track of these people , and state school officials and census men have a devil of a time .
you can bet that prying strangers ai welcome around innsmouth .
i heard personally of more one business or government man that disappeared there , and there loose talk of one who went crazy and is out at danvers now .
they must have fixed up some awful scare for that fellow .
that why i would go at night if i was you .
i never been there and have no wish to go , but i guess a daytime trip could hurt you even though the people hereabouts will advise you not to make it .
if you just sightseeing , and looking for stuff , innsmouth ought to be quite a place for you .
and so i spent part of that evening at the newburyport public library looking up data about innsmouth .
when i had tried to question the natives in the shops , the lunchroom , the garages , and the fire station , i had found them even harder to get started than the ticket agent had predicted ; and realized that i could not spare the time to overcome their first instinctive reticence .
they had a kind of obscure suspiciousness , as if there were something amiss with anyone too much interested in innsmouth .
at the , where i was stopping , the clerk merely discouraged my going to such a dismal , decadent place ; and the people at the library shewed much the same attitude .
clearly , in the eyes of the educated , innsmouth was merely an exaggerated case of civic degeneration .
the essex county histories on the library shelves had very little to say , except that the town was founded in , noted for shipbuilding before the revolution , a seat of great marine prosperity in the early century , and later a minor factory center using the manuxet as power .
the epidemic and riots of were very sparsely treated , as if they formed a discredit to the county .
references to decline were few , though the significance of the later record was unmistakable .
after the civil war all industrial life was confined to the marsh refining company , and the marketing of gold ingots formed the only remaining bit of major commerce aside from the eternal fishing .
that fishing paid less and less as the price of the commodity fell and corporations offered competition , but there was never a dearth of fish around innsmouth harbour .
foreigners seldom settled there , and there was some discreetly veiled evidence that a number of poles and portuguese who had tried it had been scattered in a peculiarly drastic fashion .
most interesting of all was a glancing reference to the strange jewelry vaguely associated with innsmouth .
it had evidently impressed the whole countryside more than a little , for mention was made of specimens in the museum of miskatonic university at arkham , and in the display room of the newburyport historical society .
the fragmentary descriptions of these things were bald and prosaic , but they hinted to me an undercurrent of persistent strangeness .
something about them seemed so odd and provocative that i could not put them out of my mind , and despite the relative lateness of the hour i resolved to see the local sample said to be a large , thing evidently meant for a tiara if it could possibly be arranged .
the librarian gave me a note of introduction to the curator of the society , a miss anna tilton , who lived nearby , and after a brief explanation that ancient gentlewoman was kind enough to pilot me into the closed building , since the hour was not outrageously late .
the collection was a notable one indeed , but in my present mood i had eyes for nothing but the bizarre object which glistened in a corner cupboard under the electric lights .
it took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange , unearthly splendour of the alien , opulent phantasy that rested there on a purple velvet cushion .
even now i can hardly describe what i saw , though it was clearly enough a sort of tiara , as the description had said .
it was tall in front , and with a very large and curiously irregular periphery , as if designed for a head of almost freakishly elliptical outline .
the material seemed to be predominantly gold , though a weird lighter lustrousness hinted at some strange alloy with an equally beautiful and scarcely identifiable metal .
its condition was almost perfect , and one could have spent hours in studying the striking and puzzlingly untraditional designs some simply geometrical , and some plainly marine chased or moulded in high relief on its surface with a craftsmanship of incredible skill and grace .
the longer i looked , the more the thing fascinated me ; and in this fascination there was a curiously disturbing element hardly to be classified or accounted for .
at first i decided that it was the queer quality of the art which made me uneasy .
all other art objects i had ever seen either belonged to some known racial or national stream , or else were consciously modernistic defiances of every recognized stream .
this tiara was neither .
it clearly belonged to some settled technique of infinite maturity and perfection , yet that technique was utterly remote from any eastern or western , ancient or modern which i had ever heard of or seen exemplified .
it was as if the workmanship were that of another planet .
however , i soon saw that my uneasiness had a second and perhaps equally potent source residing in the pictorial and mathematical suggestion of the strange designs .
the patterns all hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abysses in time and space , and the monotonously aquatic nature of the reliefs became almost sinister .
among these reliefs were fabulous monsters of abhorrent grotesqueness and malignity half ichthyic and half batrachian in suggestion which one could not dissociate from a certain haunting and uncomfortable sense of pseudomemory , as if they called up some image from deep cells and tissues whose retentive functions are wholly primal and awesomely ancestral .
at times i fancied that every contour of these blasphemous was with the ultimate quintessence of unknown and inhuman evil .
in odd contrast to the tiara aspect was its brief and prosy history as related by miss tilton .
it had been pawned for a ridiculous sum at a shop in state street in , by a drunken innsmouth man shortly afterward killed in a brawl .
the society had acquired it directly from the pawnbroker , at once giving it a display worthy of its quality .
it was labeled as of probable or indochinese provenance , though the attribution was frankly tentative .
miss tilton , comparing all possible hypotheses regarding its origin and its presence in new england , was inclined to believe that it formed part of some exotic pirate hoard discovered by old captain obed marsh .
this view was surely not weakened by the insistent offers of purchase at a high price which the marshes began to make as soon as they knew of its presence , and which they repeated to this day despite the society unvarying determination not to sell .
as the good lady shewed me out of the building she made it clear that the pirate theory of the marsh fortune was a popular one among the intelligent people of the region .
her own attitude toward shadowed innsmouth which she never seen was one of disgust at a community slipping far down the cultural scale , and she assured me that the rumours of were partly justified by a peculiar secret cult which had gained force there and engulfed all the orthodox churches .
it was called , she said , the esoteric order of dagon , and was undoubtedly a debased , thing imported from the east a century before , at a time when the innsmouth fisheries seemed to be going barren .
its persistence among a simple people was quite natural in view of the sudden and permanent return of abundantly fine fishing , and it soon came to be the greatest influence in the town , replacing freemasonry altogether and taking up headquarters in the old masonic hall on new church green .
all this , to the pious miss tilton , formed an excellent reason for shunning the ancient town of decay and desolation ; but to me it was merely a fresh incentive .
to my architectural and historical anticipations was now added an acute anthropological zeal , and i could scarcely sleep in my small room at the y as the night wore away .
shortly before ten the next morning i stood with one small valise in front of hammond drug store in old market square waiting for the innsmouth bus .
as the hour for its arrival drew near i noticed a general drift of the loungers to other places up the street , or to the ideal lunch across the square .
evidently the had not exaggerated the dislike which local people bore toward innsmouth and its denizens .
in a few moments a small of extreme decrepitude and dirty grey colour rattled down state street , made a turn , and drew up at the curb beside me .
i felt immediately that it was the right one ; a guess which the sign on the windshield soon verified .
there were only three passengers dark , unkempt men of sullen visage and somewhat youthful cast and when the vehicle stopped they clumsily shambled out and began walking up state street in a silent , almost furtive fashion .
the driver also alighted , and i watched him as he went into the drug store to make some purchase .
this , i reflected , must be the joe sargent mentioned by the ; and even before i noticed any details there spread over me a wave of spontaneous aversion which could be neither checked nor explained .
it suddenly struck me as very natural that the local people should not wish to ride on a bus owned and driven by this man , or to visit any oftener than possible the habitat of such a man and his kinsfolk .
when the driver came out of the store i looked at him more carefully and tried to determine the source of my evil impression .
he was a thin , man not much under six feet tall , dressed in shabby blue civilian clothes and wearing a frayed golf cap .
his age was perhaps , but the odd , deep creases in the sides of his neck made him seem older when one did not study his dull , expressionless face .
he had a narrow head , bulging , eyes that seemed never to wink , a flat nose , a receding forehead and chin , and singularly undeveloped ears .
his long thick lip and , greyish cheeks seemed almost beardless except for some sparse yellow hairs that straggled and curled in irregular patches ; and in places the surface seemed queerly irregular , as if peeling from some cutaneous disease .
his hands were large and heavily veined , and had a very unusual tinge .
the fingers were strikingly short in proportion to the rest of the structure , and seemed to have a tendency to curl closely into the huge palm .
as he walked toward the bus i observed his peculiarly shambling gait and saw that his feet were inordinately immense .
the more i studied them the more i wondered how he could buy any shoes to fit them .
a certain greasiness about the fellow increased my dislike .
he was evidently given to working or lounging around the fish docks , and carried with him much of their characteristic smell .
just what foreign blood was in him i could not even guess .
his oddities certainly did not look asiatic , polynesian , levantine or negroid , yet i could see why the people found him alien .
i myself would have thought of biological degeneration rather than alienage .
i was sorry when i saw there would be no other passengers on the bus .
somehow i did not like the idea of riding alone with this driver .
but as leaving time obviously approached i conquered my qualms and followed the man aboard , extending him a dollar bill and murmuring the single word innsmouth .
he looked curiously at me for a second as he returned forty cents change without speaking .
i took a seat far behind him , but on the same side of the bus , since i wished to watch the shore during the journey .
at length the decrepit vehicle stared with a jerk , and rattled noisily past the old brick buildings of state street amidst a cloud of vapour from the exhaust .
glancing at the people on the sidewalks , i thought i detected in them a curious wish to avoid looking at the bus or at least a wish to avoid seeming to look at it .
then we turned to the left into high street , where the going was smoother ; flying by stately old mansions of the early republic and still older colonial farmhouses , passing the lower green and parker river , and finally emerging into a long , monotonous stretch of open shore country .
the day was warm and sunny , but the landscape of sand and , and stunted shrubbery became more and desolate as we proceeded .
out the window i could see the blue water and the sandy line of plum island , and we presently drew very near the beach as our narrow road veered off from the main highway to rowley and ipswich .
there were no visible houses , and i could tell by the state of the road that traffic was very light hereabouts .
the telephone poles carried only two wires .
now and then we crossed crude wooden bridges over tidal creeks that wound far inland and promoted the general isolation of the region .
once in a while i noticed dead stumps and crumbling above the drifting sand , and recalled the old tradition quoted in one of the histories i had read , that this was once a fertile and countryside .
the change , it was said , came simultaneously with the innsmouth epidemic of , and was thought by simple folk to have a dark connection with hidden forces of evil .
actually , it was caused by the unwise cutting of woodlands near the shore , which robbed the soil of the best protection and opened the way for waves of sand .
at last we lost sight of plum island and saw the vast expanse of the open atlantic on our left .
our narrow course began to climb steeply , and i felt a singular sense of disquiet in looking at the lonely crest ahead where the rutted met the sky .
it was as if the bus were about to keep on in its ascent , leaving the sane earth altogether and merging with the unknown arcana of upper air and cryptical sky .
the smell of the sea took on ominous implications , and the silent driver bent , rigid back and narrow head became more and more hateful .
as i looked at him i saw that the back of his head was almost as hairless as his face , having only a few straggling yellow strands upon a grey scabrous surface .
then we reached the crest and beheld the outspread valley beyond , where the manuxet joins the sea just north of the long line of cliffs that culminate in kingsport head and veer off toward cape ann .
on the far misty horizon i could just make out the dizzy profile of the head , topped by the queer ancient house of which so many legends are told ; but for the moment all my attention was captured by the nearer panorama just below me .
i had , i realized , come face to face with innsmouth .
it was a town of wide extent and dense construction , yet one with a portentous dearth of visible life .
from the tangle of scarcely a wisp of smoke came , and the three tall steeples loomed stark and unpainted against the seaward horizon .
one of them was crumbling down at the top , and in that and another there were only black gaping holes where should have been .
the vast huddle of sagging gambrel roofs and peaked gables conveyed with offensive clearness the idea of wormy decay , and as we approached along the now descending road i could see that many roofs had wholly caved in .
there were some large square georgian houses , too , with hipped roofs , cupolas , and railed widow walks .
these were mostly well back from the water , and one or two seemed to be in moderately sound condition .
stretching inland from among them i saw the rusted , line of the abandoned railway , with leaning now devoid of wires , and the lines of the old carriage roads to rowley and ipswich .
the decay was worst close to the waterfront , though in its very midst i could spy the white belfry of a fairly well preserved brick structure which looked like a small factory .
the harbour , long clogged with sand , was enclosed by an ancient stone breakwater ; on which i could begin to discern the minute forms of a few seated fishermen , and at whose end were what looked like the foundations of a bygone lighthouse .
a sandy tongue had formed inside this barrier and upon it i saw a few decrepit cabins , moored dories , and scattered .
the only deep water seemed to be where the river poured out past the belfried structure and turned southward to join the ocean at the breakwater end .
here and there the ruins of wharves jutted out from the shore to end in indeterminate rottenness , those farthest south seeming the most decayed .
and far out at sea , despite a high tide , i glimpsed a long , black line scarcely rising above the water yet carrying a suggestion of odd latent malignancy .
this , i knew , must be devil reef .
as i looked , a subtle , curious sense of beckoning seemed superadded to the grim repulsion ; and oddly enough , i found this overtone more disturbing than the primary impression .
we met no one on the road , but presently began to pass deserted farms in varying stages of ruin .
then i noticed a few inhabited houses with rags stuffed in the broken windows and shells and dead fish lying about the littered yards .
once or twice i saw people working in barren gardens or digging clams on the beach below , and groups of dirty , children playing around doorsteps .
somehow these people seemed more disquieting than the dismal buildings , for almost every one had certain peculiarities of face and motions which i instinctively disliked without being able to define or comprehend them .
for a second i thought this typical physique suggested some picture i had seen , perhaps in a book , under circumstances of particular horror or melancholy ; but this passed very quickly .
as the bus reached a lower level i began to catch the steady note of a waterfall through the unnatural stillness , the leaning , unpainted houses grew thicker , lined both sides of the road , and displayed more urban tendencies than did those we were leaving behind , the panorama ahead had contracted to a street scene , and in spots i could see where a cobblestone pavement and stretches of brick sidewalk had formerly existed .
all the houses were apparently deserted , and there were occasional gaps where tumbledown chimneys and cellar walls told of buildings that had collapsed .
pervading everything was the most nauseous fishy odour imaginable .
soon cross streets and junctions began to appear ; those on the left leading to shoreward realms of unpaved squalor and decay , while those on the right shewed vistas of departed grandeur .
so far i had seen no people in the town , but there now came signs of a sparse habitation curtained windows here and there , and an occasional battered motorcar at the curb .
pavement and sidewalks were increasingly , and though most of the houses were quite old wood and brick structures of the early century they were obviously kept fit for habitation .
as an amateur antiquarian i almost lost my olfactory disgust and my feeling of menace and repulsion amidst this rich , unaltered survival from the past .
but i was not to reach my destination without one very strong impression of poignantly disagreeable quality .
the bus had come to a sort of open concourse or radial point with churches on two sides and the bedraggled remains of a circular green in the centre , and i was looking at a large pillared hall on the junction ahead .
the structure once white paint was now gray and peeling and the black and gold sign on the pediment was so faded that i could only with difficulty make out the words esoteric order of dagon .
this , then was the former masonic hall now given over to a degraded cult .
as i strained to decipher this inscription my notice was distracted by the raucous tones of a cracked bell across the street , and i quickly turned to look out the window on my side of the coach .
the sound came from a squat stone church of manifestly later date than most of the houses , built in a clumsy gothic fashion and having a disproportionately high basement with shuttered windows .
though the hands of its clock were missing on the side i glimpsed , i knew that those hoarse strokes were tolling the hour of eleven .
then suddenly all thoughts of time were blotted out by an onrushing image of sharp intensity and unaccountable horror which had seized me before i knew what it really was .
the door of the church basement was open , revealing a rectangle of blackness inside .
and as i looked , a certain object crossed or seemed to cross that dark rectangle ; burning into my brain a momentary conception of nightmare which was all the more maddening because analysis could not shew a single nightmarish quality in it .
it was a living object the first except the driver that i had seen since entering the compact part of the town and had i been in a steadier mood i would have found nothing whatever of terror in it .
clearly , as i realised a moment later , it was the pastor ; clad in some peculiar vestments doubtless introduced since the order of dagon had modified the ritual of the local churches .
the thing which had probably caught my first subconscious glance and supplied the touch of bizarre horror was the tall tiara he wore ; an almost exact duplicate of the one miss tilton had shown me the previous evening .
this , acting on my imagination , had supplied namelessly sinister qualities to the indeterminate face and robed , shambling form beneath it .
there was not , i soon decided , any reason why i should have felt that shuddering touch of evil .
was it not natural that a local mystery cult should adopt among its regimentals an unique type of made familiar to the community in some strange way perhaps as ?
a very thin sprinkling of youngish people now became visible on the sidewalks lone individuals , and silent knots of two or three .
the lower floors of the crumbling houses sometimes harboured small shops with dingy signs , and i noticed a parked truck or two as we rattled along .
the sound of waterfalls became more and more distinct , and presently i saw a fairly deep ahead , spanned by a wide , highway bridge beyond which a large square opened out .
as we clanked over the bridge i looked out on both sides and observed some factory buildings on the edge of the grassy bluff or part way down .
the water far below was very abundant , and i could see two vigorous sets of falls upstream on my right and at least one downstream on my left .
from this point the noise was quite deafening .
then we rolled into the large semicircular square across the river and drew up on the side in front of a tall , cupola crowned building with remnants of yellow paint and with a sign proclaiming it to be the gilman house .
i was glad to get out of that bus , and at once proceeded to check my valise in the shabby hotel lobby .
there was only one person in sight an elderly man without what i had come to call the innsmouth look and i decided not to ask him any of the questions which bothered me ; remembering that odd things had been noticed in this hotel .
instead , i strolled out on the square , from which the bus had already gone , and studied the scene minutely and appraisingly .
one side of the cobblestoned open space was the straight line of the river ; the other was a semicircle of brick buildings of about the period , from which several streets radiated away to the southeast , south , and southwest .
lamps were depressingly few and small all incandescents and i was glad that my plans called for departure before dark , even though i knew the moon would be bright .
the buildings were all in fair condition , and included perhaps a dozen shops in current operation ; of which one was a grocery of the first national chain , others a dismal restaurant , a drug store , and a wholesale office , and still another , at the eastward extremity of the square near the river an office of the town only industry the marsh refining company .
there were perhaps ten people visible , and four or five automobiles and motor trucks stood scattered about .
i did not need to be told that this was the civic centre of innsmouth .
eastward i could catch blue glimpses of the harbour , against which rose the decaying remains of three once beautiful georgian steeples .
and toward the shore on the opposite bank of the river i saw the white belfry surmounting what i took to be the marsh refinery .
for some reason or other i chose to make my first inquiries at the chain grocery , whose personnel was not likely to be native to innsmouth .
i found a solitary boy of about seventeen in charge , and was pleased to note the brightness and affability which promised cheerful information .
he seemed exceptionally eager to talk , and i soon gathered that he did not like the place , its fishy smell , or its furtive people .
a word with any outsider was a relief to him .
he hailed from arkham , boarded with a family who came from ipswich , and went back whenever he got a moment off .
his family did not like him to work in innsmouth , but the chain had transferred him there and he did not wish to give up his job .
there was , he said , no public library or chamber of commerce in innsmouth , but i could probably find my way about .
the street i had come down was federal .
west of that were the fine old residence streets broad , washington , lafayette , and adams and east of it were the shoreward slums .
it was in these slums along main street that i would find the old georgian churches , but they were all long abandoned .
it would be well not to make oneself too conspicuous in such neighbourhoods especially north of the river since the people were sullen and hostile .
some strangers had even disappeared .
certain spots were almost forbidden territory , as he had learned at considerable cost .
one must not , for example , linger much around the marsh refinery , or around any of the still used churches , or around the pillared order of dagon hall at new church green .
those churches were very odd all violently disavowed by their respective denominations elsewhere , and apparently using the queerest kind of ceremonials and clerical vestments .
their creeds were heterodox and mysterious , involving hints of certain marvelous transformations leading to bodily immorality of a sort on this earth .
the youth own pastor wallace of asbury church in arkham had gravely urged him not to join any church in innsmouth .
as for the innsmouth people the youth hardly knew what to make of them .
they were as furtive and seldom seen as animals that live in burrows , and one could hardly imagine how they passed the time apart from their desultory fishing .
perhaps judging from the quantities of bootleg liquor they consumed they lay for most of the daylight hours in an alcoholic stupor .
they seemed sullenly banded together in some sort of fellowship and understanding despising the world as if they had access to other and preferable spheres of entity .
their appearance especially those staring , unwinking eyes which one never saw shut was certainly shocking enough ; and their voices were disgusting .
it was awful to hear them chanting in their churches at night , and especially during their main festivals or revivals , which fell twice a year on april and october .
they were very fond of the water , and swam a great deal in both river and harbour .
swimming races out to devil reef were very common , and everyone in sight seemed well able to share in this arduous sport .
when one came to think of it , it was generally only rather young people who were seen about in public , and of these the oldest were apt to be the most .
when exceptions did occur , they were mostly persons with no trace of aberrancy , like the old clerk at the hotel .
one wondered what became of the bulk of the older folk , and whether the innsmouth look were not a strange and insidious which increased its hold as years advanced .
only a very rare affliction , of course , could bring about such vast and radical anatomical changes in a single individual after maturity changes invoking osseous factors as basic as the shape of the skull but then , even this aspect was no more baffling and than the visible features of the malady as a whole .
it would be hard , the youth implied , to form any real conclusions regarding such a matter ; since one never came to know the natives personally no matter how long one might live in innsmouth .
the youth was certain that many specimens even worse than the worst visible ones were kept locked indoors in some places .
people sometimes heard the queerest kind of sounds .
the tottering waterfront hovels north of the river were reputedly connected by hidden tunnels , being thus a veritable warren of unseen abnormalities .
what kind of foreign blood if any these beings had , it was impossible to tell .
they sometimes kept certain especially repulsive characters out of sight when government and others from the outside world came to town .
it would be of no use , my informant said , to ask the natives anything about the place .
the only one who would talk was a very aged but normal looking man who lived at the poorhouse on the north rim of the town and spent his time walking about or lounging around the fire station .
this hoary character , zadok allen , was years old and somewhat touched in the head , besides being the town drunkard .
he was a strange , furtive creature who constantly looked over his shoulder as if afraid of something , and when sober could not be persuaded to talk at all with strangers .
he was , however , unable to resist any offer of his favorite poison ; and once drunk would furnish the most astonishing fragments of whispered reminiscence .
after all , though , little useful data could be gained from him ; since his stories were all insane , incomplete hints of impossible marvels and horrors which could have no source save in his own disordered fancy .
nobody ever believed him , but the natives did not like him to drink and talk with strangers ; and it was not always safe to be seen questioning him .
it was probably from him that some of the wildest popular whispers and delusions were derived .
several residents had reported monstrous glimpses from time to time , but between old zadok tales and the malformed inhabitants it was no wonder such illusions were current .
none of the ever stayed out late at night , there being a widespread impression that it was not wise to do so .
besides , the streets were loathsomely dark .
as for business the abundance of fish was certainly almost uncanny , but the natives were taking less and less advantage of it .
moreover , prices were falling and competition was growing .
of course the town real business was the refinery , whose commercial office was on the square only a few doors east of where we stood .
old man marsh was never seen , but sometimes went to the works in a closed , curtained car .
there were all sorts of rumors about how marsh had come to look .
he had once been a great dandy ; and people said he still wore the finery of the edwardian age curiously adapted to certain deformities .
his son had formerly conducted the office in the square , but latterly they had been keeping out of sight a good deal and leaving the brunt of affairs to the younger generation .
the sons and their sisters had come to look very queer , especially the elder ones ; and it was said that their health was failing .
one of the marsh daughters was a repellent , woman who wore an excess of weird jewellery clearly of the same exotic tradition as that to which the strange tiara belonged .
my informant had noticed it many times , and had heard it spoken of as coming from some secret hoard , either of pirates or of demons .
the clergymen or priests , or whatever they were called nowadays also wore this kind of ornament as a headdress ; but one seldom caught glimpses of them .
other specimens the youth had not seen , though many were rumoured to exist around innsmouth .
the marshes , together with the other three gently bred families of the town the waites , the gilmans , and the eliots were all very retiring .
they lived in immense houses along washington street , and several were reputed to harbour in concealment certain living kinsfolk whose personal aspect forbade public view , and whose deaths had been reported and recorded .
warning me that many of the street signs were down , the youth drew for my benefit a rough but ample and painstaking sketch map of the town salient features .
after a moment study i felt sure that it would be of great help , and pocketed it with profuse thanks .
disliking the dinginess of the single restaurant i had seen , i bought a fair supply of cheese crackers and ginger wafers to serve as a lunch later on .
my program , i decided , would be to thread the principal streets , talk with any i might encounter , and catch the eight coach for arkham .
the town , i could see , formed a significant and exaggerated example of communal decay ; but being no sociologist i would limit my serious observations to the field of architecture .
thus i began my systematic though tour of innsmouth narrow , ways .
crossing the bridge and turning toward the roar of the lower falls , i passed close to the marsh refinery , which seemed to be oddly free from the noise of industry .
the building stood on the steep river bluff near a bridge and an open confluence of streets which i took to be the earliest civic center , displaced after the revolution by the present town square .
the gorge on the main street bridge , i struck a region of utter desertion which somehow made me shudder .
collapsing huddles of gambrel roofs formed a jagged and fantastic skyline , above which rose the ghoulish , decapitated steeple of an ancient church .
some houses along main street were tenanted , but most were tightly boarded up .
down unpaved side streets i saw the black , gaping windows of deserted hovels , many of which leaned at perilous and incredible angles through the sinking of part of the foundations .
those windows stared so spectrally that it took courage to turn eastward toward the waterfront .
certainly , the terror of a deserted house swells in geometrical rather than arithmetical progression as houses multiply to form a city of stark desolation .
the sight of such endless avenues of vacancy and death , and the thought of such linked infinities of black , brooding compartments given over to and memories and the conqueror worm , start up vestigial fears and aversions that not even the stoutest philosophy can disperse .
fish street was as deserted as main , though it differed in having many brick and stone warehouses still in excellent shape .
water street was almost its duplicate , save that there were great seaward gaps where wharves had been .
not a living thing did i see except for the scattered fishermen on the distant , and not a sound did i hear save the lapping of the harbour tides and the roar of the falls in the manuxet .
the town was getting more and more on my nerves , and i looked behind me furtively as i picked my way back over the tottering water street bridge .
the fish street bridge , according to the sketch , was in ruins .
north of the river there were traces of squalid life active houses in water street , smoking chimneys and patched roofs here and there , occasional sounds from indeterminate sources , and infrequent shambling forms in the dismal streets and unpaved lanes but i seemed to find this even more oppressive than the southerly desertion .
for one thing , the people were more hideous and abnormal than those near the centre of the town ; so that i was several times evilly reminded of something utterly fantastic which i could not quite place .
undoubtedly the alien strain in the innsmouth folk was stronger here than farther inland unless , indeed , the innsmouth look were a disease rather than a blood stain , in which case this district might be held to harbour the more advanced cases .
one detail that annoyed me was the distribution of the few faint sounds i heard .
they ought naturally to have come wholly from the visibly inhabited houses , yet in reality were often strongest inside the most rigidly facades .
there were creakings , scurryings , and hoarse doubtful noises ; and i thought uncomfortably about the hidden tunnels suggested by the grocery boy .
suddenly i found myself wondering what the voices of those denizens would be like .
i had heard no speech so far in this quarter , and was unaccountably anxious not to do so .
pausing only long enough to look at two fine but ruinous old churches at main and church streets , i hastened out of that vile waterfront slum .
my next logical goal was new church green , but somehow or other i could not bear to repass the church in whose basement i had glimpsed the inexplicably frightening form of that strangely diademmed priest or pastor .
besides , the grocery youth had told me that churches , as well as the order of dagon hall , were not advisable neighbourhoods for strangers .
accordingly i kept north along main to martin , then turning inland , crossing federal street safely north of the green , and entering the decayed patrician neighbourhood of northern broad , washington , lafayette , and adams streets .
though these stately old avenues were and unkempt , their dignity had not entirely departed .
mansion after mansion claimed my gaze , most of them decrepit and boarded up amidst neglected grounds , but one or two in each street shewing signs of occupancy .
in washington street there was a row of four or five in excellent repair and with lawns and gardens .
the most sumptuous of these with wide terraced parterres extending back the whole way to lafayette street i took to be the home of old man marsh , the afflicted refinery owner .
in all these streets no living thing was visible , and i wondered at the complete absence of cats and dogs from innsmouth .
another thing which puzzled and disturbed me , even in some of the mansions , was the tightly shuttered condition of many and attic windows .
furtiveness and secretiveness seemed universal in this hushed city of alienage and death , and i could not escape the sensation of being watched from ambush on every hand by sly , staring eyes that never shut .
i shivered as the cracked stroke of three sounded from a belfry on my left .
too well did i recall the squat church from which those notes came .
following washington street toward the river , i now faced a new zone of former industry and commerce ; noting the ruins of a factory ahead , and seeing others , with the traces of an old railway station and covered railway bridge beyond , up the gorge on my right .
the uncertain bridge now before me was posted with a warning sign , but i took the risk and crossed again to the south bank where traces of life reappeared .
furtive , shambling creatures stared cryptically in my direction , and more normal faces eyed me coldly and curiously .
innsmouth was rapidly becoming intolerable , and i turned down paine street toward the square in the hope of getting some vehicle to take me to arkham before the of that sinister bus .
it was then that i saw the tumbledown fire station on my left , and noticed the red faced , , watery eyed old man in nondescript rags who sat on a bench in front of it talking with a pair of unkempt but not abnormal looking firemen .
this , of course , must be zadok allen , the , liquorish nonagenarian whose tales of old innsmouth and its shadow were so hideous and incredible .
it must have been some imp of the perverse or some sardonic pull from dark , hidden sources which made me change my plans as i did .
i had long before resolved to limit my observations to architecture alone , and i was even then hurrying toward the square in an effort to get quick transportation out of this festering city of death and decay ; but the sight of old zadok allen set up new currents in my mind and made me slacken my pace uncertainly .
i had been assured that the old man could do nothing but hint at wild , disjointed , and incredible legends , and i had been warned that the natives made it unsafe to be seen talking with him ; yet the thought of this aged witness to the town decay , with memories going back to the early days of ships and factories , was a lure that no amount of reason could make me resist .
after all , the strangest and maddest of myths are often merely symbols or allegories based upon truth and old zadok must have seen everything which went on around innsmouth for the last ninety years .
curiosity flared up beyond sense and caution , and in my youthful egotism i fancied i might be able to sift a nucleus of real history from the confused , extravagant outpouring i would probably extract with the aid of raw whiskey .
i knew that i could not accost him then and there , for the firemen would surely notice and object .
instead , i reflected , i would prepare by getting some bootleg liquor at a place where the grocery boy had told me it was plentiful .
then i would loaf near the fire station in apparent casualness , and fall in with old zadok after he had started on one of his frequent rambles .
the youth had said that he was very restless , seldom sitting around the station for more than an hour or two at a time .
a quart bottle of whiskey was easily , though not cheaply , obtained in the rear of a dingy just off the square in eliot street .
the fellow who waited on me had a touch of the staring innsmouth look , but was quite civil in his way ; being perhaps used to the custom of such convivial strangers truckmen , , and the like as were occasionally in town .
reentering the square i saw that luck was with me ; for shuffling out of paine street around the corner of the gilman house i glimpsed nothing less than the tall , lean , tattered form of old zadok allen himself .
in accordance with my plan , i attracted his attention by brandishing my bottle and soon realised that he had begun to shuffle wistfully after me as i turned into waite street on my way to the most deserted region i could think of .
i was steering my course by the map the grocery boy had prepared , and was aiming for the wholly abandoned stretch of southern waterfront which i had previously visited .
the only people in sight there had been the fishermen on the distant breakwater ; and by going a few squares south i could get beyond the range of these , finding a pair of seats on some abandoned wharf and being free to question old zadok unobserved for an indefinite time .
before i reached main street i could hear a faint and wheezy hey , mister !
behind me and i presently allowed the old man to catch up and take copious pulls from the quart bottle .
i began putting out feelers as we walked amidst the omnipresent desolation and crazily tilted ruins , but found that the aged tongue did not loosen as quickly as i had expected .
at length i saw a opening toward the sea between crumbling brick walls , with the weedy length of an wharf projecting beyond .
piles of stones near the water promised tolerable seats , and the scene was sheltered from all possible view by a ruined warehouse on the north .
here , i thought was the ideal place for a long secret colloquy ; so i guided my companion down the lane and picked out spots to sit in among the mossy stones .
the air of death and desertion was ghoulish , and the smell of fish almost insufferable ; but i was resolved to let nothing deter me .
about four hours remained for conversation if i were to catch the eight coach for arkham , and i began to dole out more liquor to the ancient tippler ; meanwhile eating my own frugal lunch .
in my donations i was careful not to overshoot the mark , for i did not wish zadok vinous garrulousness to pass into a stupor .
after an hour his furtive taciturnity shewed signs of disappearing , but much to my disappointment he still sidetracked my questions about innsmouth and its past .
he would babble of current topics , revealing a wide acquaintance with newspapers and a great tendency to philosophise in a sententious village fashion .
toward the end of the second hour i feared my quart of whiskey would not be enough to produce results , and was wondering whether i had better leave old zadok and go back for more .
just then , however , chance made the opening which my questions had been unable to make ; and the wheezing ancient rambling took a turn that caused me to lean forward and listen alertly .
my back was toward the sea , but he was facing it and something or other had caused his wandering gaze to light on the low , distant line of devil reef , then showing plainly and almost fascinatingly above the waves .
the sight seemed to displease him , for he began a series of weak curses which ended in a confidential whisper and a knowing leer .
he bent toward me , took hold of my coat lapel , and hissed out some hints that could not be mistaken , thar whar it all begun that cursed place of all wickedness whar the deep water starts .
gate o ' hell sheer drop daown to a bottom no kin tech .
ol ' obed done it him that faound aout more was good fer him in the saouth sea islands .

never was nobody like obed old limb o ' satan !
heh , heh !
i kin mind him ' abaout furren parts , an ' callin ' all the folks stupid for goin ' to christian meetin ' an ' bearin ' their burdens meek an ' lowly .

matt eliot , his fust mate , talked a lot too , only he was again ' folks doin ' any heathen things .

thar was a little volcanic island near thar , too , whar they was other ruins with carvin ' ruins all wore away like they ben under the sea onct , an ' with picters of awful monsters all over .
wal , sir , matt he says the natives araound thar had all the fish they cud ketch , an ' sported bracelets an ' armlets an ' head rigs made aout o ' a queer kind o ' gold an ' covered with picters o ' monsters jest like the ones carved over the ruins on the little island sorter frogs or froglike fishes that was drawed in all kinds o ' positions likes they was human bein .

matt he got to wonderon ' too an ' so did obed .
obed he notices , besides , that lots of the young folks ud drop aout o ' sight fer good from year to year , an ' that they wa many old folks around .

heh , heh !
nobody never believes me naow when i tell , an ' i du you will , young feller though come to look at ye , ye hev kind o ' got them ' eyes like obed had .
the old man whisper grew fainter , and i found myself shuddering at the terrible and sincere portentousness of his intonation , even though i knew his tale could be nothing but drunken phantasy .
wal , sir , obed he larnt that they things on this arth as most folks never heerd about an ' would believe ef they did hear .
it seems these kanakys was sacrificin ' heaps o ' their young men an ' maidens to some kind o ' that lived under the sea , an ' gittin ' all kinds o ' favour in return .
they met the things on the little islet with the queer ruins , an ' it seems them awful picters o ' monsters was supposed to be picters o ' these things .

had had ages afore , but lost track o ' the upper world after a time .
what they done to the victims it ai fer me to say , an ' i guess obed none too sharp abaout askin ' .
but it was all right with the heathens , because they ben havin ' a hard time an ' was abaout everything .
they give a sarten number o ' young folks to the twice every year an ' as cud be .
also give some a ' the carved they made .
what the things agreed to give in return was plenty a ' fish they druv in from all over the sea an ' a few things naow an ' then .
wal , as i says , the natives met the things on the little volcanic islet goin ' thar in canoes with the sacrifices et , and bringin ' back any of the jools as was comin ' to .
at fust the things did never go onto the main island , but arter a time they come to want to .
seems they hankered arter mixin ' with the folks , an ' havin ' ceremonies on the big days an ' .
ye see , they was able to live both in ant aout o ' water what they call amphibians , i guess .
the kanakys told as haow folks from the other islands might wanta wipe out if they got wind o ' their bein ' thar , but they says they du keer much , because they cud wipe aout the hull brood o ' humans ef they was willin ' to bother that is , any as did be , sarten signs sech as was used onct by the lost old ones , whoever they was .
but not wantin ' to bother , they lay low when anybody visited the island .
when it come to matin ' with them ' fishes , the kanakys kind o ' balked , but finally they larnt something as put a new face on the matter .
seems that human folks has got a kind a ' relation to sech that everything alive come aout o ' the water onct an ' only needs a little change to go back agin .
them things told the kanakys that ef they mixed bloods there be children as ud look human at fust , but later turn more more like the things , till finally they take to the water an ' jine the main lot o ' things daown har .
an ' this is the important part , young feller them as turned into fish things an ' went into the water would never die .
them things never died excep ' they was kilt violent .
wal , sir , it seems by the time obed knowed them islanders they was all full o ' fish blood from them things .
when they got old an ' begun to shew it , they was kep ' hid until they felt like takin ' to the water an ' quittin ' the place .
some was more teched than others , an ' some never did change quite enough to take to the water ; but mosily they turned out jest the way them things said .
them as was born more like the things changed arly , but them as was nearly human sometimes stayed on the island till they was past seventy , though they usually go daown under for trial trips afore that .
folks as had took to the water come back a good deal to visit , so a man ud often be ' to his own who left the dry land a couple o ' hundred years or so afore .
everybody got aout o ' the idee o ' dyin ' excep ' in canoe wars with the other islanders , or as sacrifices to the daown below , or from snakebite or plague or sharp gallopin ' ailments or somethin ' afore they cud take to the water but simply looked forrad to a kind o ' change that a bit horrible arter a while .
they thought what they got was well wuth all they had to give up an ' i guess obed kind o ' come to think the same hisself when he chewed over old walakea story a bit .
walakea , though , was one of the few as had got none of the fish blood bein ' of a royal line that intermarried with royal lines on other islands .
walakea he shewed obed a lot o ' rites an ' incantations as had to do with the sea things , an ' let him see some o ' the folks in the village as had changed a lot from human shape .
somehaow or other , though , he never would let him see one of the things from right aout o ' the water .
in the end he give him a funny kind o ' thingumajig made aout o ' lead or something , that he said ud bring up the fish things from any place in the water whar they might be a nest o ' .
the idee was to drop it daown with the right kind o ' prayers an ' sech .
walakea allowed as the things was scattered all over the world , so anybody that looked abaout cud find a nest an ' bring up ef they was wanted .
matt he did like this business at all , an ' wanted obed shud keep away from the island ; but the was sharp fer gain , an ' faound he cud get them things so cheap it ud pay him to make a specialty of them .
things went on that way for years an ' obed got enough o ' that stuff to make him start the refinery in waite old fullin ' mill .
he did dass sell the pieces like they was , for folks ud be all the time askin ' questions .
all the same his crews ud get a piece an ' dispose of it naow and then , even though they was swore to keep quiet ; an ' he let his wear some o ' the pieces as was more than most .
well , come abaout when i was seven year ' old obed he faound the island people all wiped aout between .
seems the other islanders had got wind o ' what was goin ' on , and had took matters into their own hands .
they must a had , after all , them old magic signs as the sea things says was the only things they was afeard of .
no tellin ' what any o ' them kanakys will chance to git a holt of when the throws up some island with ruins the deluge .
pious cusses , these was they did leave nothin ' standin ' on either the main island or the little volcanic islet excep ' what parts of the ruins was too big to knock daown .
in some places they was little stones strewed abaout like charms with somethin ' on like what ye call a swastika naowadays .
them was the old ones ' signs .
folks all wiped aout no trace o ' no things an ' none the nearby kanakys ud breathe a word abaout the matter .
would even admit they ever ben any people on that island .
that naturally hit obed pretty hard , seein ' as his normal trade was doin ' very poor .
it hit the whole of innsmouth , too , because in seafarint days what profited the master of a ship profited the crew proportionate .
most of the folks araound the taown took the hard times kind o ' an ' resigned , but they was in bad shape because the fishin ' was peterin ' aout an ' the mills wa doin ' none too well .
then the time obed he begun ' at the folks fer bein ' dull sheep an ' prayin ' to a christian heaven as did help none .
he told he knowed o ' folks as prayed to gods that give somethin ' ye reely need , an ' says ef a good bunch o ' men ud stand by him , he cud mebbe get a holt o ' sarten paowers as ud bring plenty o ' fish an ' quite a bit of gold .
o ' course them as sarved on the sumatry queen , an ' seed the island knowed what he meant , an ' none too anxious to get clost to like they heard tell on , but them as did know what was all abaout got kind o ' swayed by what obed had to say , and begun to ast him what he cud do to sit on the way to the faith as ud bring results .
here the old man faltered , mumbled , and lapsed into a moody and apprehensive silence ; glancing nervously over his shoulder and then turning back to stare fascinatedly at the distant black reef .
when i spoke to him he did not answer , so i knew i would have to let him finish the bottle .
the insane yarn i was hearing interested me profoundly , for i fancied there was contained within it a sort of crude allegory based upon the strangeness of innsmouth and elaborated by an imagination at once creative and full of scraps of exotic legend .
not for a moment did i believe that the tale had any really substantial foundation ; but none the less the account held a hint of genuine terror if only because it brought in references to strange jewels clearly akin to the malign tiara i had seen at newburyport .
perhaps the ornaments had , after all , come from some strange island ; and possibly the wild stories were lies of the bygone obed himself rather than of this antique toper .
i handed zadok the bottle , and he drained it to the last drop .
it was curious how he could stand so much whiskey , for not even a trace of thickness had come into his high , wheezy voice .
he licked the nose of the bottle and slipped it into his pocket , then beginning to nod and whisper softly to himself .
i bent close to catch any articulate words he might utter , and thought i saw a sardonic smile behind the stained bushy whiskers .
yes he was really forming words , and i could grasp a fair proportion of them .
poor matt matt he allus was agin it tried to line up the folks on his side , an ' had long talks with the preachers no use they run the congregational parson aout o ' taown , an ' the methodist feller quit never did see resolved babcock , the baptist parson , agin wrath o ' jehovy i was a mightly little critter , but i heerd what i heerd an , seen what i seen dagon an ' ashtoreth belial an ' beelzebub golden caff an ' the idols o ' canaan an ' the philistines babylonish abominations mene , mene , tekel , upharsin .
he stopped again , and from the look in his watery blue eyes i feared he was close to a stupor after all .
but when i gently shook his shoulder he turned on me with astonishing alertness and snapped out some more obscure phrases .
du believe me , hey ?
hey , heh , heh then jest tell me , young feller , why obed an ' twenty odd other folks used to row aout to devil reef in the dead o ' night an ' chant things so laoud ye cud hear all over taown when the wind was right ?
tell me that , hey ?
an ' tell me why obed was allus droppin ' heavy things daown into the deep water side o ' the reef whar the bottom shoots daown like a cliff ye kin saound ?
tell me what he done with that lead thingumajig as walakea give him ?
hey , boy ?
an ' what did they all haowl on , an , agin the next ?
an ' why the new church parsons fellers as used to be sailors wear them queer robes an ' cover with them things obed brung ?
hey ?
the watery blue eyes were almost savage and maniacal now , and the dirty white beard bristled electrically .
old zadok probably saw me shrink back , for he began to cackle evilly .
heh , heh , heh , heh !
beginnin ' to see , hey ?
mebbe ye like to a ben me in them days , when i seed things at night aout to sea from the cupalo top o ' my haouse .
oh , i kin tell ye ' little pitchers hev big ears , an ' i missin ' nothin ' o ' what was gossiped abaout obed an ' the folks aout to the reef !
heh , heh , heh !
haow abaout the night i took my pa ship glass up to the cupalo an ' seed the reef ' thick with shapes that dove off quick soon the moon riz ?
obed an ' the folks was in a dory , but them shapes dove off the far side into the deep water an ' never come up haow ye like to be a little shaver alone up in a cupola ' shapes as human shapes ? heh ? heh , heh , heh the old man was getting hysterical , and i began to shiver with a nameless alarm .
he laid a gnarled claw on my shoulder , and it seemed to me that its shaking was not altogether that of mirth .
one night ye seed somethin ' heavy heaved offen obed dory beyond the reef ' and then learned next day a young feller was missin ' from home .
hey !
did anybody ever see hide or hair o ' hiram gilman agin .
did they ?
an ' nick pierce , an ' luelly waite , an ' adoniram saouthwick , an ' henry garrison .
hey ?
heh , heh , heh , heh shapes talkin ' sign language with their hands them as had reel hands wal , sir , that was the time obed begun to git on his feet agin .
folks see his three darters ' things as nobody never see on afore , an ' smoke stared comin ' aout o ' the chimbly .
other folks was , too fish begun to swarm into the harbour fit to kill an ' heaven knows what sized cargoes we begun to ship aout to , arkham , an ' boston .
was then obed got the ol ' branch railrud put through .
some kingsport fishermen heerd abaout the ketch an ' come up in sloops , but they was all lost .
nobody never see agin .
an ' jest then our folk organised the esoteric order ' dagon , an ' bought masonic hall offen calvary commandery for it heh , heh , heh !
matt eliot was a mason an ' agin the sellin ' , but he dropped aout o ' sight jest then .
remember , i ai sayin ' obed was set on hevin ' things jest like they was on that kanaky isle .
i du think he aimed at fust to do no mixin ' , nor raise no younguns to take to the water an ' turn into fishes with eternal life .
he wanted them gold things , an ' was willin ' to pay heavy , an ' i guess the others was satisfied fer a while come in ' the taown done some lookin ' an ' thinkin ' fer itself .
too many folks missin ' too much wild preachin ' at meetin ' of a sunday too much talk abaout that reef .
i guess i done a bit by tellin ' selectman mowry what i see from the cupalo .
they was a party one night as follered obed craowd aout to the reef , an ' i heerd shots betwixt the dories .
nex ' day obed and others was in gaol , with everybody ' jest what was afoot and jest what charge agin cud he got to holt .
god , ef anybody look ahead a couple o ' weeks later , when nothin ' had ben throwed into the sea fer thet long zadok was shewing sings of fright and exhaustion , and i let him keep silence for a while , though glancing apprehensively at my watch .
the tide had turned and was coming in now , and the sound of the waves seemed to arouse him .
i was glad of that tide , for at high water the fishy smell might not be so bad .
again i strained to catch his whispers .
that awful night i seed .
i was up in the cupalo hordes of swarms of all over the reef an ' swimmin ' up the harbour into the manuxet god , what happened in the streets of innsmouth that night they rattled our door , but pa would open then he clumb aout the kitchen winder with his musket to find selecman mowry an ' see what he cud do maounds o ' the dead an ' the dyin ' shots and screams shaoutin ' in ol squar an ' taown squar an ' new church green gaol throwed open proclamation treason called it the plague when folks come in an ' faoud haff our people missin ' nobody left but them as ud jine in with obed an ' them things or else keep quiet never heard o ' my pa no more the old man was panting and perspiring profusely .
his grip on my shoulder tightened .
everything cleaned up in the mornin ' but they was traces obed he kinder takes charge an ' says things is goin ' to be changed others worship with us at , an ' sarten haouses hez got to entertin guests they wanted to mix like they done with the kanakys , an ' he for one did feel baound to stop .
far gone , was obed jest like a crazy man on the subjeck .
he says they brung us fish an ' treasure , an ' shud hev what they hankered after nothin ' was to be on the aoutside ; only we was to keep shy o ' strangers ef we knowed what was good fer us .
we all hed to take the oath o ' dagon , an ' later on they was secon ' an ' third oaths that some o ' us took .
them as ud help special , ud git special rewards gold an ' sech no use balkin ' , fer they was millions of daown thar .
they ruther not start risin ' an ' wipin ' aout , but ef they was gave away an ' forced to , they cud do a lot toward jest that .
we did hev them old charms to cut off like folks in the saouth sea did , an ' them kanakys wud never give away their secrets .
yield up enough sacrifices an ' savage an ' harbourage in the taown when they wanted it , an ' they let well enough alone .
wud bother no strangers as might bear tales aoutside that is , withaout they got pryin ' .
all in the band of the faithful order ' dagon an ' the children shud never die , but go back to the mother hydra an ' father dagon what we all come from onct ia !
ia !
cthulhu fhtagn !
cthulhu fhtaga old zadok was fast lapsing into stark raving , and i held my breath .
poor old soul to what pitiful depths of hallucination had his liquor , plus his hatred of the decay , alienage , and disease around him , brought that fertile , imaginative brain ?
he began to moan now , and tears were coursing down his channelled checks into the depths of his beard .
god , what i seen senct i was fifteen year ' old mene , mene , tekel , upharsin ! the folks as was missin ' , and them as kilt theirselves them as told things in arkham or ipswich or sech places was all called crazy , like you callin ' me right naow but god , what i seen they a kilt me long ago fer ' what i know , only i took the fust an ' secon ' oaths o ' dago offen obed , so was pertected unlessen a jury of proved i told things knowin ' an ' but i wud take the third oath i a died take that it got wuss araound civil war time , when children born senct begun to grow up some , that is .
i was afeared never did no pryin ' arter that awful night , an ' never see one o ' them clost to in all my life .
that is , never no one .
i went to the war , an ' ef i a had any guts or sense i a never come back , but settled away from here .
but folks wrote me things so bad .
that , i , was because draft men was in taown arter .
arter the war it was jest as bad agin .
people begun to fall off mills an ' shops shet daown shippin ' stopped an ' the harbour choked up railrud give up but they they never stopped swimmin ' in an ' aout o ' the river from that cursed reef o ' satan an ' more an ' more attic winders got up , an ' more an ' more noises was heerd in haouses as to hev nobody in folks aoutside hev their stories abaout us you heerd a plenty on , seein ' what questions ye ast stories abaout things they seed naow an ' then , an ' abaout that queer joolry as still comes in from somewhars an ' ai quite all melted up but nothin ' never gits .
nobody believe nothin ' .
they call them things pirate loot , an ' allaow the innsmouth folks hez furren blood or is or somethin ' .
beside , them that lives here shoo off as many strangers as they kin , an ' encourage the rest not to git very , specially raound night time .
beasts balk at the critters hosses mules but when they got autos that was all right .
in obed took a second wife that nobody in the taown never see some says he did want to , but was made to by them as he called in had three children by her two as disappeared young , but one gal as looked like anybody else an ' was eddicated in europe .
obed finally got her married off by a trick to an arkham feller as did suspect nothin ' .
but nobody aoutside hav nothin ' to do with innsmouth folks naow .
barnabas marsh that runs the now is obed grandson by his fust wife son of onesiphorus , his eldest son , but his mother was another o ' them as never seen aoutdoors .
right naow barnabas is abaout changed .
ca shet his eyes no more , an ' is all aout o ' shape .
they say he still wears clothes , but he take to the water soon .
mebbe he tried it already they do sometimes go daown for little spells afore they go daown for good .
ai ben seed abaout in public fer nigh on ten year ' .
du know haow his poor wife kin feel she come from ipiwich , an ' they nigh lynched barnabas when he courted her fifty odd year ' ago .
obed he died in an ' all the next is gone naow the fust wife children dead , and the rest god knows the sound of the incoming tide was now very insistent , and little by little it seemed to change the old man mood from maudlin tearfulness to watchful fear .
he would pause now and then to renew those nervous glances over his shoulder or out toward the reef , and despite the wild absurdity of his tale , i could not help beginning to share his apprehensiveness .
zadok now grew shriller , seemed to be trying to whip up his courage with louder speech .
hey , yew , why du ye say somethin ' ?
haow ye like to be livin ' in a taown like this , with everything ' an ' dyin ' , an ' monsters crawlin ' an ' bleatin ' an ' barkin ' an ' hoppin ' araoun ' black cellars an ' attics every way ye turn ?
hey ?
haow ye like to hear the haowlin ' night arter night from the churches an ' order o ' dagon hall , an ' know what doin ' part o ' the haowlin ' ?
haow ye like to hear what comes from that awful reef every an ' hallowmass ?
hey ?
think the old man crazy , eh ?
wal , sir , let me tell ye that ai the wust !
zadok was really screaming now , and the mad frenzy of his voice disturbed me more than i care to own .
curse ye , du set thar ' at me with them eyes i tell obed marsh he in hell , an , hez got to stay thar !
heh , heh in hell , i says !
ca git me i hai done nothin ' nor told nobody nothin ' oh , you , young feller ?
wal , even ef i hai told nobody nothin ' yet , i ' to naow !
yew jest set still an ' listen to me , boy this is what i ai never told nobody i says i did get to do pryin ' arter that night but i faound things about jest the same !
yew want to know what the reel horror is , hey ?
wal , it this it ai what them fish devils hez done , but what they ' to do !
they ' things up aout o ' whar they come from into the taown been doin ' it fer years , an ' slackenin ' up lately .
them haouses north o ' the river water an ' main streets is full of them devils an ' what they brung an ' when they git ready i say , when they git ever hear tell of a shoggoth ?
hey , d hear me ?
i tell ye i know what them things be i seen one night when !
the hideous suddenness and inhuman frightfulness of the old man shriek almost made me faint .
his eyes , looking past me toward the malodorous sea , were positively starting from his head ; while his face was a mask of fear worthy of greek tragedy .
his bony claw dug monstrously into my shoulder , and he made no motion as i turned my head to look at whatever he had glimpsed .
there was nothing that i could see .
only the incoming tide , with perhaps one set of ripples more local than the line of breakers .
but now zadok was shaking me , and i turned back to watch the melting of that face into a chaos of twitching eyelids and mumbling gums .
presently his voice came back albeit as a trembling whisper .
git aout o ' here !
get aout o ' here !
they seen us git aout fer your life !
du wait fer nothin ' they know naow run fer it quick aout o ' this taown another heavy wave dashed against the loosing masonry of the bygone wharf , and changed the mad ancient whisper to another inhuman and scream .
! yheaaaaaa !
before i could recover my scattered wits he had relaxed his clutch on my shoulder and dashed wildly inland toward the street , reeling northward around the ruined warehouse wall .
i glanced back at the sea , but there was nothing there .
and when i reached water street and looked along it toward the north there was no remaining trace of zadok allen .
i can hardly describe the mood in which i was left by this harrowing episode an episode at once mad and pitiful , grotesque and terrifying .
the grocery boy had prepared me for it , yet the reality left me none the less bewildered and disturbed .
puerile though the story was , old zadok insane earnestness and horror had communicated to me a mounting unrest which joined with my earlier sense of loathing for the town and its blight of intangible shadow .
later i might sift the tale and extract some nucleus of historic allegory ; just now i wished to put it out of my head .
the hour grown perilously late my watch said , and the arkham bus left town square at eight so i tried to give my thoughts as neutral and practical a cast as possible , meanwhile walking rapidly through the deserted streets of gaping roofs and leaning houses toward the hotel where i had checked my valise and would find my bus .
though the golden light of late afternoon gave the ancient roofs and decrepit chimneys an air of mystic loveliness and peace , i could not help glancing over my shoulder now and then .
i would surely be very glad to get out of malodorous and innsmouth , and wished there were some other vehicle than the bus driven by that fellow sargent .
yet i did not hurry too precipitately , for there were architectural details worth viewing at every silent corner ; and i could easily , i calculated , cover the necessary distance in a .
studying the grocery youth map and seeking a route i had not traversed before , i chose marsh street instead of state for my approach to town square .
near the corner of fall street i began to see scattered groups of furtive whisperers , and when i finally reached the square i saw that almost all the loiterers were congregated around the door of the gilman house .
it seemed as if many bulging , watery , unwinking eyes looked oddly at me as i claimed my valise in the lobby , and i hoped that none of these unpleasant creatures would be my on the coach .
the bus , rather early , rattled in with three passengers somewhat before eight , and an fellow on the sidewalk muttered a few indistinguishable words to the driver .
sargent threw out a and a roll of newspapers , and entered the hotel ; while the passengers the same men whom i had seen arriving in newburyport that morning shambled to the sidewalk and exchanged some faint guttural words with a loafer in a language i could have sworn was not english .
i boarded the empty coach and took the seat i had taken before , but was hardly settled before sargent and began mumbling in a throaty voice of peculiar repulsiveness .
i was , it appeared , in very bad luck .
there had been something wrong with the engine , despite the excellent time made from newburyport , and the bus could not complete the journey to arkham .
no , it could not possibly be repaired that night , nor was there any other way of getting transportation out of innsmouth either to arkham or elsewhere .
sargent was sorry , but i would have to stop over at the gilman .
probably the clerk would make the price easy for me , but there was nothing else to do .
almost dazed by this sudden obstacle , and violently dreading the fall of night in this decaying and town , i left the bus and reentered the hotel lobby ; where the sullen night clerk told me i could have room on next the top floor large , but without running water for a dollar .
despite what i had heard of this hotel in newburyport , i signed the register , paid my dollar , let the clerk take my valise , and followed that sour , solitary attendant up three creaking flights of stairs past dusty corridors which seemed wholly devoid of life .
my room was a dismal rear one with two windows and bare , cheap furnishings , overlooked a dingy otherwise hemmed in by low , deserted brick blocks , and commanded a view of decrepit roofs with a marshy countryside beyond .
at the end of the corridor was a bathroom a discouraging relique with ancient marble bowl , tin tub , faint electric light , and musty wooded paneling around all the plumbing fixtures .
it being still daylight , i descended to the square and looked around for a dinner of some sort ; noticing as i did so the strange glances i received from the unwholesome loafers .
since the grocery was closed , i was forced to patronise the restaurant i had shunned before ; a stooped , man with staring , unwinking eyes , and a wench with unbelievably thick , clumsy hands being in attendance .
the service was all of the counter type , and it relieved me to find that much was evidently served from cans and packages .
a bowl of vegetable soup with crackers was enough for me , and i soon headed back for my cheerless room at the gilman ; getting a evening paper and a magazine from the clerk at the rickety stand beside his desk .
as twilight deepened i turned on the one feeble electric bulb over the cheap , bed , and tried as best i could to continue the reading i had begun .
i felt it advisable to keep my mind wholesomely occupied , for it would not do to brood over the abnormalities of this ancient , town while i was still within its borders .
the insane yarn i had heard from the aged drunkard did not promise very pleasant dreams , and i felt i must keep the image of his wild , watery eyes as far as possible from my imagination .
also , i must not dwell on what that factory inspector had told the newburyport about the gilman house and the voices of its nocturnal tenants not on that , nor on the face beneath the tiara in the black church doorway ; the face for whose horror my conscious mind could not account .
it would perhaps have been easier to keep my thoughts from disturbing topics had the room not been so gruesomely musty .
as it was , the lethal mustiness blended hideously with the town general fishy odour and persistently focussed one fancy on death and decay .
another thing that disturbed me was the absence of a bolt on the door of my room .
one had been there , as marks clearly shewed , but there were signs of recent removal .
no doubt it had been out of order , like so many other things in this decrepit edifice .
in my nervousness i looked around and discovered a bolt on the clothes press which seemed to be of the same size , judging from the marks , as the one formerly on the door .
to gain a partial relief from the general tension i busied myself by transferring this hardware to the vacant place with the aid of a handy device including a screwdriver which i kept on my .
the bolt fitted perfectly , and i was somewhat relieved when i knew that i could shoot it firmly upon retiring .
not that i had any real apprehension of its need , but that any symbol of security was welcome in an environment of this kind .
there were adequate bolts on the two lateral doors to connecting rooms , and these i proceeded to fasten .
i did not undress , but decided to read till i was sleepy and then lie down with only my coat , collar , and shoes off .
taking a pocket flash light from my valise , i placed it in my trousers , so that i could read my watch if i woke up later in the dark .
drowsiness , however , did not come ; and when i stopped to analyse my thoughts i found to my disquiet that i was really unconsciously listening for something listening for something which i dreaded but could not name .
that inspector story must have worked on my imagination more deeply than i had suspected .
again i tried to read , but found that i made no progress .
after a time i seemed to hear the stairs and corridors creak at intervals as if with footsteps , and wondered if the other rooms were beginning to fill up .
there were no voices , however , and it struck me that there was something subtly furtive about the creaking .
i did not like it , and debated whether i had better try to sleep at all .
this town had some queer people , and there had undoubtedly been several disappearances .
was this one of those inns where travelers were slain for their money ?
surely i had no look of excessive prosperity .
or were the towns folk really so resentful about curious visitors ?
had my obvious sightseeing , with its frequent , aroused unfavorable notice .
it occurred to me that i must be in a highly nervous state to let a few random creakings set me off speculating in this fashion but i regretted none the less that i was unarmed .
at length , feeling a fatigue which had nothing of drowsiness in it , i bolted the newly outfitted hall door , turned off the light , and threw myself down on the hard , uneven bed coat , collar , shoes , and all .
in the darkness every faint noise of the night seemed magnified , and a flood of doubly unpleasant thoughts swept over me .
i was sorry i had put out the light , yet was too tired to rise and turn it on again .
then , after a long , dreary interval , and prefaced by a fresh creaking of stairs and corridor , there came that soft , damnably unmistakable sound which seemed like a malign fulfillment of all my apprehensions .
without the least shadow of a doubt , the lock of my door was being tried cautiously , furtively , tentatively with a key .
my sensations upon recognising this sign of actual peril were perhaps less rather than more tumultuous because of my previous vague fears .
i had been , albeit without definite reason , instinctively on my guard and that was to my advantage in the new and real crisis , whatever it might turn out to be .
nevertheless the change in the menace from vague premonition to immediate reality was a profound shock , and fell upon me with the force of a genuine blow .
it never once occurred to me that the fumbling might be a mere mistake .
malign purpose was all i could think of , and i kept deathly quiet , awaiting the intruder next move .
after a time the cautious rattling ceased , and i heard the room to the north entered with a .
then the lock of the connecting door to my room was softly tried .
the bolt held , of course , and i heard the floor creak as the prowler left the room .
after a moment there came another soft rattling , and i knew that the room to the south of me was being entered .
again a furtive trying of a bolted connecting door , and again a receding creaking .
this time the creaking went along the hall and down the stairs , so i knew that the prowler had realised the bolted condition of my doors and was giving up his attempt for a greater or lesser time , as the future would shew .
the readiness with which i fell into a plan of action proves that i must have been subconsciously fearing some menace and considering possible avenues of escape for hours .
from the first i felt that the unseen fumbler meant a danger not to be met or dealt with , but only to be fled from as precipitately as possible .
the one thing to do was to get out of that hotel alive as quickly as i could , and through some channel other than the front stairs and lobby .
rising softly and throwing my flashlight on the switch , i sought to light the bulb over my bed in order to choose and pocket some belongings for a swift , valiseless flight .
nothing , however , happened ; and i saw that the power had been cut off .
clearly , some cryptic , evil movement was afoot on a large scale just what , i could not say .
as i stood pondering with my hand on the now useless switch i heard a muffled creaking on the floor below , and thought i could barely distinguish voices in conversation .
a moment later i felt less sure that the deeper sounds were voices , since the apparent hoarse barkings and croakings bore so little resemblance to recognized human speech .
then i thought with renewed force of what the factory inspector had heard in the night in this mouldering and pestilential building .
having filled my pockets with the flashlight aid , i put on my hat and tiptoed to the windows to consider chances of descent .
despite the state safety regulations there was no fire escape on this side of the hotel , and i saw that my windows commanded only a sheer three story drop to the cobbled courtyard .
on the right and left , however , some ancient brick business blocks abutted on the hotel ; their slant roofs coming up to a reasonable jumping distance from my level .
to reach either of these lines of buildings i would have to be in a room two from my own in one case on the north and in the other case on the south and my mind instantly set to work what chances i had of making the transfer .
i could not , i decided , risk an emergence into the corridor ; where my footsteps would surely be heard , and where the difficulties of entering the desired room would be insuperable .
my progress , if it was to be made at all , would have to be through the less connecting doors of the rooms ; the locks and bolts of which i would have to force violently , using my shoulder as a whenever they were set against me .
this , i thought , would be possible owing to the rickety nature of the house and its fixtures ; but i realised i could not do it noiselessly .
i would have to count on sheer speed , and the chance of getting to a window before any hostile forces became coordinated enough to open the right door toward me with a .
my own outer door i reinforced by pushing the bureau against it little by little , in order to make a minimum of sound .
i perceived that my chances were very slender , and was fully prepared for any calamity .
even getting to another roof would not solve the problem for there would then remain the task of reaching the ground and escaping from the town .
one thing in my favour was the deserted and ruinous state of the abutting building and the number of skylights gaping blackly open in each row .
gathering from the grocery boy map that the best route out of town was southward , i glanced first at the connecting door on the south side of the room .
it was designed to open in my direction , hence i saw after drawing the bolt and finding other fastening in place it was not a favorable one for forcing .
accordingly abandoning it as a route , i cautiously moved the bedstead against it to hamper any attack which might be made on it later from the next room .
the door on the north was hung to open away from me , and this though a test proved it to be locked or bolted from the other side i knew must be my route .
if i could gain the roofs of the buildings in paine street and descend successfully to the ground level , i might perhaps dart through the courtyard and the adjacent or opposite building to washington or bates or else emerge in paine and edge around southward into washington .
in any case , i would aim to strike washington somehow and get quickly out of the town square region .
my preference would be to avoid paine , since the fire station there might be open all night .
as i thought of these things i looked out over the squalid sea of decaying roofs below me , now brightened by the beams of a moon not much past full .
on the right the black gash of the clove the panorama ; abandoned factories and railway station clinging to its sides .
beyond it the rusted railway and the rowley road led off through a flat marshy terrain dotted with islets of higher and dryer land .
on the left the was nearer , the narrow road to ipswich gleaming white in the moonlight .
i could not see from my side of the hotel the southward route toward arkham which i had determined to take .
i was irresolutely speculating on when i had better attack the northward door , and on how i could least audibly manage it , when i noticed that the vague noises underfoot had given place to a fresh and heavier creaking of the stairs .
a wavering flicker of light shewed through my transom , and the boards of the corridor began to groan with a ponderous load .
muffled sounds of possible vocal origin approached , and at length a firm knock came at my outer door .
for a moment i simply held my breath and waited .
eternities seemed to elapse , and the nauseous fishy odour of my environment seemed to mount suddenly and spectacularly .
then the knocking was repeated continuously , and with growing insistence .
i knew that the time for action had come , and forthwith drew the bolt of the northward connecting door , bracing myself for the task of battering it open .
the knocking waxed louder , and i hoped that its volume would cover the sound of my efforts .
at last beginning my attempt , i lunged again and again at the thin paneling with my left shoulder , heedless of shock or pain .
the door resisted even more than i expected , but i did not give in .
and all the while the clamour at the outer door increased .
finally the connecting door gave , but with such a crash that i knew those outside must have heard .
instantly the outside knocking became a violent battering , while keys sounded ominously in the hall doors of the rooms on both sides of me .
rushing through the newly opened connexion , i succeeded in bolting the northerly hall door before the lock could be turned ; but even as i did so i heard the hall door of the third room the one from whose window i had hoped to reach the roof below being tried with a .
for an instant i felt absolute despair , since my trapping in a chamber with no window egress seemed complete .
a wave of almost abnormal horror swept over me , and invested with a terrible but unexplainable singularity the dust prints made by the intruder who had lately tried my door from this room .
then , with a dazed automatism which persisted despite hopelessness , i made for the next connecting door and performed the blind motion of pushing at it in an effort to get through and granting that fastenings might be as providentially intact as in this second room bolt the hall door beyond before the lock could be turned from outside .
sheer fortunate chance gave me my reprieve for the connecting door before me was not only unlocked but actually ajar .
in a second i was though , and had my right knee and shoulder against a hall door which was visibly opening inward .
my pressure took the opener off guard , for the thing shut as i pushed , so that i could slip the bolt as i had done with the other door .
as i gained this respite i heard the battering at the two other doors abate , while a confused clatter came from the connecting door i had shielded with the bedstead .
evidently the bulk of my assailants had entered the southerly room and were massing in a lateral attack .
but at the same moment a sounded in the next door to the north , and i knew that a nearer peril was at hand .
the northward connecting door was wide open , but there was no time to think about checking the already turning lock in the hall .
all i could do was to shut and bolt the open connecting door , as well as its mate on the opposite side pushing a bedstead against the one and a bureau against the other , and moving a washstand in front of the hall door .
i must , i saw , trust to such makeshift barriers to shield me till i could get out the window and on the roof of the paine street block .
but even in this acute moment my chief horror was something apart from the immediate weakness of my defenses .
i was shuddering because not one of my pursuers , despite some hideous panting , grunting , and subdued barkings at odd intervals , was uttering an unmuffled or intelligible vocal sound .
as i moved the furniture and rushed toward the windows i heard a frightful scurrying along the corridor toward the room north of me , and perceived that the southward battering had ceased .
plainly , most of my opponents were about to concentrate against the feeble connecting door which they knew must open directly on me .
outside , the moon played on the ridgepole of the block below , and i saw that the jump would be desperately hazardous because of the steep surface on which i must land .
surveying the conditions , i chose the more southerly of the two windows as my avenue of escape ; planning to land on the inner slope of the roof and make for the nearest .
once inside one of the decrepit brick structures i would have to reckon with pursuit ; but i hoped to descend and dodge in and out of yawning doorways along the shadowed courtyard , eventually getting to washington street and slipping out of town toward the south .
the clatter at the northerly connecting door was now terrific , and i saw that the weak panelling was beginning to splinter .
obviously , the besiegers had brought some ponderous object into play as a .
the bedstead , however , still held firm ; so that i had at least a faint chance of making good my escape .
as i opened the window i noticed that it was flanked by heavy velour draperies suspended from a pole by brass rings , and also that there was a large projecting catch for the shutters on the exterior .
seeing a possible means of avoiding the dangerous jump , i yanked at the hangings and brought them down , pole and all ; then quickly hooking two of the rings in the shutter catch and flinging the drapery outside .
the heavy folds reached fully to the abutting roof , and i saw that the rings and catch would be likely to bear my weight .
so , climbing out of the window and down the improvised rope ladder , i left behind me forever the morbid and fabric of the gilman house .
i landed safely on the loose slates of the steep roof , and succeeded in gaining the gaping black skylight without a slip .
glancing up at the window i had left , i observed it was still dark , though far across the crumbling chimneys to the north i could see lights ominously blazing in the order of dagon hall , the baptist church , and the congregational church which i recalled so shiveringly .
there had seemed to be no one in the courtyard below , and i hoped there would be a chance to get away before the spreading of a general alarm .
flashing my pocket lamp into the skylight , i saw that there were no steps down .
the distance was slight , however , so i clambered over the brink and dropped ; striking a dusty floor littered with crumbling boxes and barrels .
the place was , but i was past minding such impressions and made at once for the staircase revealed by my flashlight after a hasty glance at my watch , which shewed the hour to be .
the steps creaked , but seemed tolerably sound ; and i raced down past a barnlike second storey to the ground floor .
the desolation was complete , and only echoes answered my footfalls .
at length i reached the lower hall at the end of which i saw a faint luminous rectangle marking the ruined paine street doorway .
heading the other way , i found the back door also open ; and darted out and down five stone steps to the cobblestones of the courtyard .
the moonbeams did not reach down here , but i could just see my way about without using the flashlight .
some of the windows on the gilman house side were faintly glowing , and i thought i heard confused sounds within .
walking softly over to the washington street side i perceived several open doorways , and chose the nearest as my route out .
the hallway inside was black , and when i reached the opposite end i saw that the street door was wedged immovably shut .
resolved to try another building , i groped my way back toward the courtyard , but stopped short when close to the doorway .
for out of an opened door in the gilman house a large crowd of doubtful shapes was pouring lanterns bobbing in the darkness , and horrible croaking voices exchanging low cries in what was certainly not english .
the figures moved uncertainly , and i realized to my relief that they did not know where i had gone ; but for all that they sent a shiver of horror through my frame .
their features were indistinguishable , but their crouching , shambling gait was abominably repellent .
and worst of all , i perceived that one figure was strangely robed , and unmistakably surmounted by a tall tiara of a design altogether too familiar .
as the figures spread throughout the courtyard , i felt my fears increase .
suppose i could find no egress from this building on the street side ?
the fishy odour was detestable , and i wondered i could stand it without fainting .
again groping toward the street , i opened a door off the hall and came upon an empty room with closely shuttered but sashless windows .
fumbling in the rays of my flashlight , i found i could open the shutters ; and in another moment had climbed outside and was fully closing the aperture in its original manner .
i was now in washington street , and for the moment saw no living thing nor any light save that of the moon .
from several directions in the distance , however , i could hear the sound of hoarse voices , of footsteps , and of a curious kind of pattering which did not sound quite like footsteps .
plainly i had no time to lose .
the points of the compass were clear to me , and i was glad that all the street lights were turned off , as is often the custom on strongly moonlit nights in prosperous rural regions .
some of the sounds came from the south , yet i retained my design of escaping in that direction .
there would , i knew , be plenty of deserted doorways to shelter me in case i met any person or group who looked like pursuers .
i walked rapidly , softly , and close to the ruined houses .
while hatless and dishevelled after my arduous climb , i did not look especially noticeable ; and stood a good chance of passing unheeded if forced to encounter any casual wayfarer .
at bates street i drew into a yawning vestibule while two shambling figures crossed in front of me , but was soon on my way again and approaching the open space where eliot street obliquely crosses washington at the intersection of south .
though i had never seen this space , it had looked dangerous to me on the grocery youth map ; since the moonlight would have free play there .
there was no use trying to evade it , for any alternative course would involve detours of possibly disastrous visibility and delaying effect .
the only thing to do was to cross it boldly and openly ; imitating the typical shamble of the innsmouth folk as best i could , and trusting that no one or at least no pursuer of mine would be there .
just how fully the pursuit was organised and indeed , just what its purpose might be i could form no idea .
there seemed to be unusual activity in the town , but i judged that the news of my escape from the gilman had not yet spread .
i would , of course , soon have to shift from washington to some other southward street ; for that party from the hotel would doubtless be after me .
i must have left dust prints in that last old building , revealing how i had gained the street .
the open space was , as i had expected , strongly moonlit ; and i saw the remains of a parklike , green in its center .
fortunately no one was about though a curious sort of buzz or roar seemed to be increasing in the direction of town square .
south street was very wide , leading directly down a slight declivity to the waterfront and commanding a long view out to sea ; and i hoped that no one would be glancing up it from afar as i crossed in the bright moonlight .
my progress was unimpeded , and no fresh sound arose to hint that i had been spied .
glancing about me , i involuntarily let my pace slacken for a second to take in the sight of the sea , gorgeous in the burning moonlight at the street end .
far out beyond the breakwater was the dim , dark line of devil reef , and as i glimpsed it i could not help thinking of all the hideous legends i had heard in the last hours legends which portrayed this ragged rock as a veritable gateway to realms of unfathomed horror and inconceivable abnormality .
then , without warning , i saw the intermittent flashes of light on the distant reef .
they were definite and unmistakable , and awaked in my mind a blind horror beyond all rational proportion .
my muscles tightened for panic flight , held in only by a certain unconscious caution and fascination .
and to make matters worse , there now flashed forth from the lofty cupola of the gilman house , which loomed up to the northeast behind me , a series of analogous though differently spaced gleams which could be nothing less than an answering signal .
controlling my muscles , and realising afresh how plainly visible i was , i resumed my brisker and feignedly shambling pace ; though keeping my eyes on that hellish and ominous reef as long as the opening of south street gave me a seaward view .
what the whole proceeding meant , i could not imagine ; unless it involved some strange rite connected with devil reef , or unless some party had landed from a ship on that sinister rock .
i now bent to the left around the ruinous green ; still gazing toward the ocean as it blazed in the spectral summer moonlight , and watching the cryptical flashing of those nameless , unexplainable beacons .
it was then that the most horrible impression of all was borne in upon me the impression which destroyed my last vestige of and sent me running frantically southward past the yawning black doorways and fishily staring windows of that deserted nightmare street .
for at a closer glance i saw that the moonlit waters between the reef and the shore were far from empty .
they were alive with a teeming horde of shapes swimming inward toward the town ; and even at my vast distance and in my single moment of perception i could tell that the bobbing heads and flailing arms were alien and aberrant in a way scarcely to be expressed or consciously formulated .
my frantic running ceased before i had covered a block , for at my left i began to hear something like the hue and cry of organised pursuit .
there were footsteps and guttural sounds , and a rattling motor wheezed south along federal street .
in a second all my plans were utterly changed for if the southward highway were blocked ahead of me , i must clearly find another egress from innsmouth .
i paused and drew into a gaping doorway , reflecting how lucky i was to have left the moonlit open space before these pursuers came down the parallel street .
a second reflection was less comforting .
since the pursuit was down another street , it was plain that the party was not following me directly .
it had not seen me , but was simply obeying a general plan of cutting off my escape .
this , however , implied that all roads leading out of innsmouth were similarly patrolled ; for the people could not have known what route i intended to take .
if this were so , i would have to make my retreat across country away from any road ; but how could i do that in view of the marshy and nature of all the surrounding region ?
for a moment my brain reeled both from sheer hopelessness and from a rapid increase in the omnipresent fishy odour .
then i thought of the abandoned railway to rowley , whose solid line of ballasted , earth still stretched off to the northwest from the crumbling station on the edge at the .
there was just a chance that the townsfolk would not think of that ; since its desertion made it , and the unlikeliest of all avenues for a fugitive to choose .
i had seen it clearly from my hotel window and knew about how it lay .
most of its earlier length was uncomfortably visible from the rowley road , and from high places in the town itself ; but one could perhaps crawl inconspicuously through the undergrowth .
at any rate , it would form my only chance of deliverance , and there was nothing to do but try it .
drawing inside the hall of my deserted shelter , i once more consulted the grocery boy map with the aid of the flashlight .
the immediate problem was how to reach the ancient railway ; and i now saw that the safest course was ahead to babson street ; then west to lafayette there edging around but not crossing an open space homologous to the one i had traversed and subsequently back northward and westward in a zigzagging line through lafayette , bates , adam , and bank streets the latter skirting the river gorge to the abandoned and dilapidated station i had seen from my window .
my reason for going ahead to babson was that i wished neither to recross the earlier open space nor to begin my westward course along a cross street as broad as south .
starting once more , i crossed the street to the side in order to edge around into babson as inconspicuously as possible .
noises still continued in federal street , and as i glanced behind me i thought i saw a gleam of light near the building through which i had escaped .
anxious to leave washington street , i broke into a quiet dogtrot , trusting to luck not to encounter any observing eye .
next the corner of babson street i saw to my alarm that one of the houses was still inhabited , as attested by curtains at the window ; but there were no lights within , and i passed it without disaster .
in babson street , which crossed federal and might thus reveal me to the searchers , i clung as closely as possible to the sagging , uneven buildings ; twice pausing in a doorway as the noises behind me momentarily increased .
the open space ahead shone wide and desolate under the moon , but my route would not force me to cross it .
during my second pause i began to detect a fresh distribution of vague sounds ; and upon looking cautiously out from cover beheld a motor car darting across the open space , bound outward along eliot street , which there intersects both babson and lafayette .
as i watched choked by a sudden rise in the fishy odour after a short abatement i saw a band of uncouth , crouching shapes loping and shambling in the same direction ; and knew that this must be the party guarding the ipswich road , since that highway forms an extension of eliot street .
two of the figures i glimpsed were in voluminous robes , and one wore a peaked diadem which glistened whitely in the moonlight .
the gait of this figure was so odd that it sent a chill through me for it seemed to me the creature was almost hopping .
when the last of the band was out of sight i resumed my progress ; darting around the corner into lafayette street , and crossing eliot very hurriedly lest stragglers of the party be still advancing along that thoroughfare .
i did hear some croaking and clattering sounds far off toward town square , but accomplished the passage without disaster .
my greatest dread was in broad and moonlit south street with its seaward view and i had to nerve myself for the ordeal .
someone might easily be looking , and possible eliot street stragglers could not fail to glimpse me from either of two points .
at the last moment i decided i had better slacken my trot and make the crossing as before in the shambling gait of an average innsmouth native .
when the view of the water again opened out this time on my right i was not to look at it at all .
i could not however , resist ; but cast a sidelong glance as i carefully and imitatively shambled toward the protecting shadows ahead .
there was no ship visible , as i had there would be .
instead , the first thing which caught my eye was a small rowboat pulling in toward the abandoned wharves and laden with some bulky , object .
its rowers , though distantly and indistinctly seen , were of an especially repellent aspect .
several swimmers were still discernible ; while on the far black reef i could see a faint , steady glow unlike the winking beacon visible before , and of a curious colour which i could not precisely identify .
above the slant roofs ahead and to the right there loomed the tall cupola of the gilman house , but it was completely dark .
the fishy odour , dispelled for a moment by some merciful breeze , now closed in again with maddening intensity .
i had not quite crossed the street when i heard a muttering band advancing along washington from the north .
as they reached the broad open space where i had had my first disquieting glimpse of the moonlit water i could see them plainly only a block away and was horrified by the bestial abnormality of their faces and the doglike of their crouching gait .
one man moved in a positively simian way , with long arms frequently touching the ground ; while another figure robed and tiaraed seemed to progress in an almost hopping fashion .
i judged this party to be the one i had seen in the gilman courtyard the one , therefore , most closely on my trail .
as some of the figures turned to look in my direction i was transfixed with fright , yet managed to preserve the casual , shambling gait i had assumed .
to this day i do not know whether they saw me or not .
if they did , my stratagem must have deceived them , for they passed on across the moonlit space without varying their course meanwhile croaking and jabbering in some hateful guttural patois i could not identify .
once more in shadow , i resumed my former past the leaning and decrepit houses that stared blankly into the night .
having crossed to the western sidewalk i rounded the nearest corner into bates street where i kept close to the buildings on the southern side .
i passed two houses shewing signs of habitation , one of which had faint lights in upper rooms , yet met with no obstacle .
as i turned into adams street i felt measurably safer , but received a shook when a man reeled out of a black doorway directly in front of me .
he proved , however , too hopelessly drunk to be a menace ; so that i reached the dismal ruins of the bank street warehouses in safety .
no one was stirring in that dead street beside the , and the roar of the waterfalls quite drowned my foot steps .
it was a long to the ruined station , and the great brick warehouse walls around me seemed somehow more terrifying than the fronts of private houses .
at last i saw the ancient arcaded station or what was left of it and made directly for the tracks that started from its farther end .
the rails were rusty but mainly intact , and not more than half the ties had rotted away .
walking or running on such a surface was very difficult ; but i did my best , and on the whole made very fair time .
for some distance the line kept on along the gorge brink , but at length i reached the long covered bridge where it crossed the chasm at a dizzying height .
the condition of this bridge would determine my next step .
if humanly possible , i would use it ; if not , i would have to risk more street wandering and take the nearest intact highway bridge .
the vast , barnlike length of the old bridge gleamed spectrally in the moonlight , and i saw that the ties were safe for at least a few feet within .
entering , i began to use my flashlight , and was almost knocked down by the cloud of bats that flapped past me .
about across there was a perilous gap in the ties which i feared for a moment would halt me ; but in the end i risked a desperate jump which fortunately succeeded .
i was glad to see the moonlight again when i emerged from that macabre tunnel .
the old tracks crossed river street at grade , and at once veered off into a region increasingly rural and with less and less of innsmouth abhorrent fishy odour .
here the dense growth of weeds and briers hindered me and cruelly tore at my clothes , but i was none the less glad that they were there to give me concealment in case of peril .
i knew that much of my route must be visible from the rowley road .
the marshy region began very abruptly , with the single track on a low , grassy embankment where the weedy growth was somewhat thinner .
then came a sort of island of higher ground , where the line passed through a shallow open cut choked with bushes and brambles .
i was very glad of this partial shelter , since at this point the rowley road was uncomfortably near according to my window view .
at the end of the cut it would cross the track and swerve off to a safer distance ; but meanwhile i must be exceedingly careful .
i was by this time thankfully certain that the railway itself was not patrolled .
just before entering the cut i glanced behind me , but saw no pursuer .
the ancient spires and roofs of decaying innsmouth gleamed lovely and ethereal in the magic yellow moonlight , and i thought of how they must have looked in the old days before the shadow fell .
then , as my gaze circled inland from the town , something less tranquil arrested my notice and held me immobile for a second .
what i saw or fancied i saw was a disturbing suggestion of undulant motion far to the south ; a suggestion which made me conclude that a very large horde must be pouring out of the city along the level ipswich road .
the distance was great and i could distinguish nothing in detail ; but i did not at all like the look of that moving column .
it undulated too much , and glistened too brightly in the rays of the now westering moon .
there was a suggestion of sound , too , though the wind was blowing the other way a suggestion of bestial scraping and bellowing even worse than the muttering of the parties i had lately overheard .
all sorts of unpleasant conjectures crossed my mind .
i thought of those very extreme innsmouth types said to be hidden in crumbling , centuried warrens near the waterfront ; i thought , too , of those nameless swimmers i had seen .
counting the parties so far glimpsed , as well as those presumably covering other roads , the number of my pursuers must be strangely large for a town as depopulated as innsmouth .
whence could come the dense personnel of such a column as i now beheld ?
did those ancient , unplumbed warrens teem with a twisted , uncatalogued , and unsuspected life ?
or had some unseen ship indeed landed a legion of unknown outsiders on that hellish reef ?
who were they ?
why were they here ?
and if such a column of them was scouring the ipswich road , would the patrols on the other roads be likewise augmented ?
i had entered the cut and was struggling along at a very slow pace when that damnable fishy odour again waxed dominant .
had the wind suddenly changed eastward , so that it blew in from the sea and over the town ?
it must have , i concluded , since i now began to hear shocking guttural murmurs from that hitherto silent direction .
there was another sound , too a kind of wholesale , colossal flopping or pattering which somehow called up images of the most detestable sort .
it made me think illogically of that unpleasantly undulating column on the ipswich road .
and then both stench and sounds grew stronger , so that i paused shivering and grateful for the cut protection .
it was here , i recalled , that the rowley road drew so close to the old railway before crossing westward and diverging .
something was coming along that road , and i must lie low till its passage and vanishment in the distance .
thank heaven these creatures employed no dogs for tracking though perhaps that would have been impossible amidst the omnipresent regional odour .
crouched in the bushes of that sandy cleft i felt reasonably safe , even though i knew the searchers would have to cross the track in front of me not much more than a hundred yards away .
i would be able to see them , but they could not , except by a malign miracle , see me .
all at once i began dreading to look at them as they passed .
i saw the close moonlit space where they would surge by , and had curious thoughts about the irredeemable pollution of that space .
they would perhaps be the worst of all innsmouth types something one would not care to remember .
the stench waxed overpowering , and the noises swelled to a bestial babel of croaking , baying and barking without the least suggestion of human speech .
were these indeed the voices of my pursuers ?
did they have dogs after all ?
so far i had seen none of the lower animals in innsmouth .
that flopping or pattering was monstrous i could not look upon the degenerate creatures responsible for it .
i would keep my eyes shut till the sound receded toward the west .
the horde was very close now air foul with their hoarse snarlings , and the ground almost shaking with their footfalls .
my breath nearly ceased to come , and i put every ounce of into the task of holding my eyelids down .
i am not even yet willing to say whether what followed was a hideous actuality or only a nightmare hallucination .
the later action of the government , after my frantic appeals , would tend to confirm it as a monstrous truth ; but could not an hallucination have been repeated under the spell of that ancient , haunted , and shadowed town ?
such places have strange properties , and the legacy of insane legend might well have acted on more than one human imagination amidst those dead , streets and huddles of rotting roofs and crumbling steeples .
is it not possible that the germ of an actual contagious madness lurks in the depths of that shadow over innsmouth ?
who can be sure of reality after hearing things like the tale of old zadok allen ?
the government men never found poor zadok , and have no conjectures to make as to what became of him .
where does madness leave off and reality begin ?
is it possible that even my latest fear is sheer delusion ?
but i must try to tell what i thought i saw that night under the mocking yellow moon saw surging and hopping down the rowley road in plain sight in front of me as i crouched among the wild brambles of that desolate railway cut .
of course my resolution to keep my eyes shut had failed .
it was foredoomed to failure for who could crouch blindly while a legion of croaking , baying entities of unknown source flopped noisomely past , scarcely more than a hundred yards away ?
i thought i was prepared for the worst , and i really ought to have been prepared considering what i had seen before .
my other pursuers had been accursedly abnormal so should i not have been ready to face a strengthening of the abnormal element ; to look upon forms in which there was no mixture of the normal at all ?
i did not open my eyes until the raucous clamour came loudly from a point obviously straight ahead .
then i knew that a long section of them must be plainly in sight where the sides of the cut flattened out and the road crossed the track and i could no longer keep myself from sampling whatever horror that leering yellow moon might have to shew .
it was the end , for whatever remains to me of life on the surface of this earth , of every vestige of mental peace and confidence in the integrity of nature and of the human mind .
nothing that i could have imagined nothing , even , that i could have gathered had i credited old zadok crazy tale in the most literal way would be in any way comparable to the demoniac , blasphemous reality that i saw or believe i saw .
i have tried to hint what it was in order to postpone the horror of writing it down baldly .
can it be possible that this planet has actually spawned such things ; that human eyes have truly seen , as objective flesh , what man has hitherto known only in febrile phantasy and tenuous legend ?
and yet i saw them in a limitless stream flopping , hopping , croaking , bleating urging inhumanly through the spectral moonlight in a grotesque , malignant saraband of fantastic nightmare .
and some of them had tall tiaras of that nameless metal and some were strangely robed and one , who led the way , was clad in a ghoulishly humped black coat and striped trousers , and had a man felt hat perched on the shapeless thing that answered for a head .
i think their predominant colour was a , though they had white bellies .
they were mostly shiny and slippery , but the ridges of their backs were scaly .
their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid , while their heads were the heads of fish , with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed .
at the sides of their necks were palpitating gills , and their long paws were webbed .
they hopped irregularly , sometimes on two legs and sometimes on four .
i was somehow glad that they had no more than four limbs .
their croaking , baying voices , clearly used for articulate speech , held all the dark shades of expression which their staring faces lacked .
but for all of their monstrousness they were not unfamiliar to me .
i knew too well what they must be for was not the memory of the evil tiara at newburyport still fresh ?
they were the blasphemous of the nameless design living and horrible and as i saw them i knew also of what that humped , tiaraed priest in the black church basement had fearsomely reminded me .
their number was past guessing .
it seemed to me that there were limitless swarms of them and certainly my momentary glimpse could have shewn only the least fraction .
in another instant everything was blotted out by a merciful fit of fainting ; the first i had ever had .
v it was a gentle daylight rain that awaked me front my stupor in the railway cut , and when i staggered out to the roadway ahead i saw no trace of any prints in the fresh mud .
the fishy odour , too , was gone , innsmouth ruined roofs and toppling steeples loomed up greyly toward the southeast , but not a living creature did i spy in all the desolate salt marshes around .
my watch was still going , and told me that the hour was past noon .
the reality of what i had been through was highly uncertain in my mind , but i felt that something hideous lay in the background .
i must get away from innsmouth and accordingly i began to test my cramped , wearied powers of locomotion .
despite weakness hunger , horror , and bewilderment i found myself after a time able to walk ; so started slowly along the muddy road to rowley .
before evening i was in village , getting a meal and providing myself with presentable clothes .
i caught the night train to arkham , and the next day talked long and earnestly with government officials there ; a process i later repeated in boston .
with the main result of these colloquies the public is now familiar and i wish , for normality sake , there were nothing more to tell .
perhaps it is madness that is overtaking me yet perhaps a greater horror or a greater marvel is reaching out .
as may well be imagined , i gave up most of the foreplanned features of the rest of my tour the scenic , architectural , and antiquarian diversions on which i had counted so heavily .
nor did i dare look for that piece of strange jewelry said to be in the miskatonic university museum .
i did , however , improve my stay in arkham by collecting some genealogical notes i had long wished to possess ; very rough and hasty data , it is true , but capable of good use later on when i might have time to collate and codify them .
the curator of the historical society there lapham peabody was very courteous about assisting me , and expressed unusual interest when i told him i was a grandson of eliza orne of arkham , who was born in and had married james williamson of ohio at the age of seventeen .
it seemed that a maternal uncle of mine had been there many years before on a quest much like my own ; and that my grandmother family was a topic of some local curiosity .
there had , peabody said , been considerable discussion about the marriage of her father , benjamin orne , just after the civil war ; since the ancestry of the bride was peculiarly puzzling .
that bride was understood to have been an orphaned marsh of new hampshire a cousin of the essex county marshes but her education had been in france and she knew very little of her family .
a guardian had deposited funds in a boston bank to maintain her and her french governess ; but that guardian name was unfamiliar to arkham people , and in time he dropped out of sight , so that the governess assumed the role by court appointment .
the frenchwoman now long dead was very taciturn , and there were those who said she could have told more than she did .
but the most baffling thing was the inability of anyone to place the recorded parents of the young woman enoch and lydia ( meserve ) marsh among the known families of new hampshire .
possibly , many suggested , she was the natural daughter of some marsh of prominence she certainly had the true marsh eyes .
most of the puzzling was done after her early death , which took place at the birth of my grandmother her only child .
having formed some disagreeable impressions connected with the name of marsh , i did not welcome the news that it belonged on my own ancestral tree ; nor was i pleased by peabody suggestion that i had the true marsh eyes myself .
however , i was grateful for data which i knew would prove valuable ; and took copious notes and lists of book references regarding the orne family .
i went directly home to toledo from boston , and later spent a month at maumee recuperating from my ordeal .
in september i entered oberlin for my final year , and from then till the next june was busy with studies and other wholesome activities reminded of the bygone terror only by occasional official visits from government men in connexion with the campaign which my pleas and evidence had started .
around the middle of july just a year after the innsmouth experience i spent a week with my late mother family in cleveland ; checking some of my new genealogical data with the various notes , traditions , and bits of heirloom material in existence there , and seeing what kind of a connected chart i could construct .
i did not exactly relish this task , for the atmosphere of the williamson home had always depressed me .
there was a strain of morbidity there , and my mother had never encouraged my visiting her parents as a child , although she always welcomed her father when he came to toledo .
my grandmother had seemed strange and almost terrifying to me , and i do not think i grieved when she disappeared .
i was eight years old then , and it was said that she had wandered off in grief after the suicide of my uncle douglas , her eldest son .
he had shot himself after a trip to new england the same trip , no doubt , which had caused him to be recalled at the arkham historical society .
this uncle had resembled her , and i had never liked him either .
something about the staring , unwinking expression of both of them had given me a vague , unaccountable uneasiness .
my mother and uncle walter had not looked like that .
they were like their father , though poor little cousin lawrence walter son had been almost perfect duplicate of his grandmother before his condition took him to the permanent seclusion of a sanitarium at canton .
i had not seen him in four years , but my uncle once implied that his state , both mental and physical , was very bad .
this worry had probably been a major cause of his mother death two years before .
my grandfather and his widowed son walter now comprised the cleveland household , but the memory of older times hung thickly over it .
i still disliked the place , and tried to get my researches done as quickly as possible .
williamson records and traditions were supplied in abundance by my grandfather ; though for orne material i had to depend on my uncle walter , who put at my disposal the contents of all his files , including notes , letters , cuttings , heirlooms , photographs , and miniatures .
it was in going over the letters and pictures on the orne side that i began to acquire a kind of terror of my own ancestry .
as i have said , my grandmother and uncle douglas had always disturbed me .
now , years after their passing , i gazed at their pictured faces with a measurably heightened feeling of repulsion and alienation .
i could not at first understand the change , but gradually a horrible sort of comparison began to obtrude itself on my unconscious mind despite the steady refusal of my consciousness to admit even the least suspicion of it .
it was clear that the typical expression of these faces now suggested something it had not suggested before something which would bring stark panic if too openly thought of .
but the worst shock came when my uncle shewed me the orne jewellery in a downtown safe deposit vault .
some of the items were delicate and inspiring enough , but there was one box of strange old pieces descended from my mysterious which my uncle was almost reluctant to produce .
they were , he said , of very grotesque and almost repulsive design , and had never to his knowledge been publicly worn ; though my grandmother used to enjoy looking at them .
vague legends of bad luck clustered around them , and my french governess had said they ought not to be worn in new england , though it would be quite safe to wear them in europe .
as my uncle began slowly and grudgingly to unwrap the things he urged me not to be shocked by the strangeness and frequent hideousness of the designs .
artists and archaeologists who had seen them pronounced their workmanship superlatively and exotically exquisite , though no one seemed able to define their exact material or assign them to any specific art tradition .
there were two armlets , a tiara , and a kind of pectoral ; the latter having in high relief certain figures of almost unbearable extravagance .
during this description i had kept a tight rein on my emotions , but my face must have betrayed my mounting fears .
my uncle looked concerned , and paused in his unwrapping to study my countenance .
i motioned to him to continue , which he did with renewed signs of reluctance .
he seemed to expect some demonstration when the first piece the tiara became visible , but i doubt if he expected quite what actually happened .
i did not expect it , either , for i thought i was thoroughly forewarned regarding what the jewellery would turn out to be .
what i did was to faint silently away , just as i had done in that railway cut a year before .
from that day on my life has been a nightmare of brooding and apprehension nor do i know how much is hideous truth and how much madness .
my had been a marsh of unknown source whose husband lived in arkham and did not old zadok say that the daughter of obed marsh by a monstrous mother was married to an arkham man through trick ?
what was it the ancient toper had muttered about the line of my eyes to captain obed ?
in arkham , too , the curator had told me i had the true marsh eyes .
was obed marsh my own ?
who or what then , was my ?
but perhaps this was all madness .
those ornaments might easily have been bought from some innsmouth sailor by the father of my , whoever he was .
and that look in the faces of my grandmother and uncle might be sheer fancy on my part sheer fancy , bolstered up by the innsmouth shadow which had so darkly coloured my imagination .
but why had my uncle killed himself after an ancestral quest in new england ?
for more than two years i fought off these reflections with partial success .
my father secured me a place in an insurance office , and i buried myself in routine as deeply as possible .
in the winter of , however , the dreams began .
they were very sparse and insidious at first , but increased in frequency and vividness as the weeks went by .
great watery spaces opened out before me , and i seemed to wander through titanic sunken porticos and labyrinths of weedy cyclopean walls with grotesque fishes as my companions .
then the other shapes began to appear , filling me with nameless horror the moment i awoke .
but during the dreams they did not horrify me at all i was one with them ; wearing their unhuman trappings , treading their aqueous ways , and praying monstrously at their evil temples .
there was much more than i could remember , but even what i did remember each morning would be enough to stamp me as a madman or a genius if ever i dared write it down .
some frightful influence , i felt , was seeking gradually to drag me out of the sane world of wholesome life into unnamable abysses of blackness and alienage ; and the process told heavily on me .
my health and appearance grew steadily worse , till finally i was forced to give up my position and adopt the static , secluded life of an invalid .
some odd nervous affliction had me in its grip , and i found myself at times almost unable to shut my eyes .
it was then that i began to study the mirror with mounting alarm .
the slow ravages of disease are not pleasant to watch , but in my case there was something subtler and more puzzling in the background .
my father seemed to notice it , too , for he began looking at me curiously and almost affrightedly .
what was taking place in me ?
could it be that i was coming to resemble my grandmother and uncle douglas ?
one night i had a frightful dream in which i met my grandmother under the sea .
she lived in a phosphorescent palace of many terraces , with gardens of strange leprous corals and grotesque brachiate efflorescences , and welcomed me with a warmth that may have been sardonic .
she had changed as those who take to the water change and told me she had never died .
instead , she had gone to a spot her dead son had learned about , and had leaped to a realm whose wonders destined for him as well he had spurned with a smoking pistol .
this was to be my realm , too i could not escape it .
i would never die , but would live with those who had lived since before man ever walked the earth .
i met also that which had been her grandmother .
for eighty thousand years had lived in , and thither she had gone back after obed marsh was dead .
was not destroyed when the men shot death into the sea .
it was hurt , but not destroyed .
the deep ones could never be destroyed , even though the palaeogean magic of the forgotten old ones might sometimes check them .
for the present they would rest ; but some day , if they remembered , they would rise again for the tribute great cthulhu craved .
it would be a city greater than innsmouth next time .
they had planned to spread , and had brought up that which would help them , but now they must wait once more .
for bringing the men death i must do a penance , but that would not be heavy .
this was the dream in which i saw a shoggoth for the first time , and the sight set me awake in a frenzy of screaming .
that morning the mirror definitely told me i had acquired the innsmouth look .
so far i have not shot myself as my uncle douglas did .
i bought an automatic and almost took the step , but certain dreams deterred me .
the tense extremes of horror are lessening , and i feel queerly drawn toward the unknown instead of fearing them .
i hear and do strange things in sleep , and awake with a kind of exaltation instead of terror .
i do not believe i need to wait for the full change as most have waited .
if i did , my father would probably shut me up in a sanitarium as my poor little cousin is shut up .
stupendous and splendors await me below , and i shall seek them soon .
cihuiha flgagnl id ia !
no , i shall not shoot myself i can not be made to shoot myself !
i shall plan my cousin escape from that canton , and together we shall go to innsmouth .
we shall swim out to that brooding reef in the sea and dive down through black abysses to cyclopean and , and in that lair of the deep ones we shall dwell amidst wonder and glory for ever .
i after years of nightmare and terror , saved only by a desperate conviction of the mythical source of certain impressions , i am unwilling to vouch for the truth of that which i think i found in western australia on the night of july .
there is reason to hope that my experience was wholly or partly an hallucination for which , indeed , abundant causes existed .
and yet , its realism was so hideous that i sometimes find hope impossible .
if the thing did happen , then man must be prepared to accept notions of the cosmos , and of his own place in the seething vortex of time , whose merest mention is paralysing .
he must , too , be placed on guard against a specific , lurking peril which , though it will never engulf the whole race , may impose monstrous and unguessable horrors upon certain venturesome members of it .
it is for this latter reason that i urge , with all the force of my being , final abandonment of all the attempts at unearthing those fragments of unknown , primordial masonry which my expedition set out to investigate .
assuming that i was sane and awake , my experience on that night was such as has befallen no man before .
it was , moreover , a frightful confirmation of all i had sought to dismiss as myth and dream .
mercifully there is no proof , for in my fright i lost the awesome object which would if real and brought out of that noxious abyss have formed irrefutable evidence .
when i came upon the horror i was alone and i have up to now told no one about it .
i could not stop the others from digging in its direction , but chance and the shifting sand have so far saved them from finding it .
now i must formulate some definite statement not only for the sake of my own mental balance , but to warn such others as may read it seriously .
these pages much in whose earlier parts will be familiar to close readers of the general and scientific press are written in the cabin of the ship that is bringing me home .
i shall give them to my son , professor wingate peaslee of miskatonic university the only member of my family who stuck to me after my queer amnesia of long ago , and the man best informed on the inner facts of my case .
of all living persons , he is least likely to ridicule what i shall tell of that fateful night .
i did not enlighten him orally before sailing , because i think he had better have the revelation in written form .
reading and at leisure will leave with him a more convincing picture than my confused tongue could hope to convey .
he can do anything that he thinks best with this account showing it , with suitable comment , in any quarters where it will be likely to accomplish good .
it is for the sake of such readers as are unfamiliar with the earlier phases of my case that i am prefacing the revelation itself with a fairly ample summary of its background .
my name is nathaniel wingate peaslee , and those who recall the newspaper tales of a generation back or the letters and articles in psychological journals six or seven years ago will know who and what i am .
the press was filled with the details of my strange amnesia in , and much was made of the traditions of horror , madness , and witchcraft which lurked behind the ancient massachusetts town then and now forming my place of residence .
yet i would have it known that there is nothing whatever of the mad or sinister in my heredity and early life .
this is a highly important fact in view of the shadow which fell so suddenly upon me from outside sources .
it may be that centuries of dark brooding had given to crumbling , arkham a peculiar vulnerability as regards such shadows though even this seems doubtful in the light of those other cases which i later came to study .
but the chief point is that my own ancestry and background are altogether normal .
what came , came from somewhere else where i even now hesitate to assert in plain words .
i am the son of jonathan and hannah ( wingate ) peaslee , both of wholesome old haverhill stock .
i was born and reared in haverhill at the old homestead in boardman street near golden hill and did not go to arkham till i entered miskatonic university as instructor of political economy in .
for thirteen years more my life ran smoothly and happily .
i married alice keezar of haverhill in , and my three children , robert , wingate and hannah were born in , , and , respectively .
in i became an associate professor , and in a full professor .
at no time had i the least interest in either occultism or abnormal psychology .
it was on thursday , may , that the queer amnesia came .
the thing was quite sudden , though later i realized that certain brief , glimmering visions of several hours previous chaotic visions which disturbed me greatly because they were so unprecedented must have formed premonitory symptoms .
my head was aching , and i had a singular feeling altogether new to me that some one else was trying to get possession of my thoughts .
the collapse occurred about , while i was conducting a class in political economy history and present tendencies of economics for juniors and a few sophomores .
i began to see strange shapes before my eyes , and to feel that i was in a grotesque room other than the classroom .
my thoughts and speech wandered from my subject , and the students saw that something was gravely amiss .
then i slumped down , unconscious , in my chair , in a stupor from which no one could arouse me .
nor did my rightful faculties again look out upon the daylight of our normal world for five years , four months , and thirteen days .
it is , of course , from others that i have learned what followed .
i showed no sign of consciousness for sixteen and a half hours though removed to my home at crane street , and given the best of medical attention .
at may my eyes opened and began to speak and my family were thoroughly frightened by the trend of my expression and language .
it was clear that i had no remembrance of my identity and my past , though for some reason seemed anxious to conceal his lack of knowledge .
my eyes glazed strangely at the persons around me , and the flections of my facial muscles were altogether unfamiliar .
even my speech seemed awkward and foreign .
i used my vocal organs clumsily and gropingly , and my diction had a curiously stilted quality , as if i had laboriously learned the english language from books .
the pronunciation was barbarously alien , whilst the idiom seemed to include both scraps of curious archaism and expressions of a wholly incomprehensible cast .
of the latter , one in particular was very potently even terrifiedly recalled by the youngest of the physicians twenty years afterward .
for at that late period such a phrase began to have an actual currency first in england and then in the united states and though of much complexity and indisputable newness , it reproduced in every least particular the mystifying words of the strange arkham patient of .
physical strength returned at once , although i required an odd amount of in the use of my hands , legs , and bodily apparatus in general .
because of this and other handicaps inherent in the mnemonic lapse , i was for some time kept under strict medical care .
when i saw that my attempts to conceal the lapse had failed , i admitted it openly , and became eager for information of all sorts .
indeed , it seemed to the doctors that i lost interest in my proper personality as soon as i found the case of amnesia accepted as a natural thing .
they noticed that my chief efforts were to master certain points in history , science , art , language , and folklore some of them tremendously abstruse , and some childishly simple which remained , very oddly in many cases , outside my consciousness .
at the same time they noticed that i had an inexplicable command of many almost unknown sorts of knowledge a command which i seemed to wish to hide rather than display .
i would inadvertently refer , with casual assurance , to specific events in dim ages outside of the range of accepted history passing off such references as a jest when i saw the surprise they created .
and i had a way of speaking of the future which two or three times caused actual fright .
these uncanny flashes soon ceased to appear , though some observers laid their vanishment more to a certain furtive caution on my part than to any waning of the strange knowledge behind them .
indeed , i seemed anomalously avid to absorb the speech , customs , and perspectives of the age around me ; as if i were a studious traveller from a far , foreign land .
as soon as permitted , i haunted the college library at all hours ; and shortly began to arrange for those odd travels , and special courses at american and european universities , which evoked so much comment during the next few years .
i did not at any time suffer from a lack of learned contacts , for my case had a mild celebrity among the psychologists of the period .
i was lectured upon as a typical example of secondary personality even though i seemed to puzzle the lecturers now and then with some bizarre symptoms or some queer trace of carefully veiled mockery .
of real friendliness , however , i encountered little .
something in my aspect and speech seemed to excite vague fears and aversions in every one i met , as if i were a being infinitely removed from all that is normal and healthful .
this idea of a black , hidden horror connected with incalculable gulfs of some sort of distance was oddly widespread and persistent .
my own family formed no exception .
from the moment of my strange waking my wife had regarded me with extreme horror and loathing , vowing that i was some utter alien usurping the body of her husband .
in she obtained a legal divorce , nor would she ever consent to see me even after my return to normality in .
these feelings were shared by my elder son and my small daughter , neither of whom i have ever seen since .
only my second son , wingate , seemed able to conquer the terror and repulsion which my change aroused .
he indeed felt that i was a stranger , but though only eight years old held fast to a faith that my proper self would return .
when it did return he sought me out , and the courts gave me his custody .
in succeeding years he helped me with the studies to which i was driven , and today , at , he is a professor of psychology at miskatonic .
but i do not wonder at the horror caused for certainly , the mind , voice , and facial expression of the being that awakened on may , were not those of nathaniel wingate peastee .
i will not attempt to tell much of my life from to , since readers may glean i the outward essentials as i largely had to do from files of old newspapers and scientific journals .
i was given charge of my funds , and spent them slowly and on the whole wisely , in travel and in study at various centres of learning .
my travels , however , were singular in the extreme , involving long visits to remote and desolate places .
in i spent a month in the himalayas , and in roused much attention through a camel trip into the unknown deserts of arabia .
what happened on those journeys i have never been able to learn .
during the summer of i chartered a ship and sailed in the arctic , north of spitzbergen , afterward showing signs of disappointment .
later in that year i spent weeks alone beyond the limits of previous or subsequent exploration in the vast limestone cavern systems of western virginia black labyrinths so complex that no retracing of my steps could even be considered .
my sojourns at the universities were marked by abnormally rapid assimilation , as if the secondary personality had an intelligence enormously superior to my own .
i have found , also , that my rate of reading and solitary study was phenomenal .
i could master every detail of a book merely by glancing over it as fast as i could turn the leaves ; while my skill at interpreting complex figures in an instant was veritably awesome .
at times there appeared almost ugly reports of my power to influence the thoughts and acts of others , though i seemed to have taken care to minimize displays of this faculty .
other ugly reports concerned my intimacy with leaders of occultist groups , and scholars suspected of connection with nameless bands of abhorrent hierophants .
these rumours , though never proved at the time , were doubtless stimulated by the known tenor of some of my reading for the consultation of rare books at libraries can not be effected secretly .
there is tangible proof in the form of marginal notes that i went minutely through such things as the comte cultes des goules , ludvig prinn de vermis mysteriis , the unaussprechlichen kulten of von junzt , the surviving fragments of the puzzling book of eibon , and the dreaded necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred .
then , too , it is undeniable that a fresh and evil wave of underground cult activity set in about the time of my odd mutation .
in the summer of i began to display signs of ennui and flagging interest , and to hint to various associates that a change might soon be expected in me .
i spoke of returning memories of my earlier life though most auditors judged me insincere , since all the recollections i gave were casual , and such as might have been learned from my old private papers .
about the middle of august i returned to arkham and my house in crane street .
here i installed a mechanism of the most curious aspect , constructed piecemeal by different makers of scientific apparatus in europe and america , and guarded carefully from the sight of any one intelligent enough to analyse it .
those who did see it a workman , a servant , and the new housekeeper say that it was a queer mixture of rods , wheels , and mirros , though only about two feet tall , one foot wide , and one foot thick .
the central mirror was circular and convex .
all this is borne out by such makers of parts as can be located .
on the evening of friday , september , i dismissed the housekeeper and the maid until noon of the next day .
lights burned in the house till late , and a lean , dark , curiously man called in an automobile .
it was about one that the lights were last seen .
at a policeman observed the place in darkness , but the stranger motor still at the curb .
by the motor was certainly gone .
it was at that a hesitant , foreign voice on the telephone asked dr wilson to call at my house and bring me out of a peculiar faint .
this call a one was later traced to a public booth in the north station in boston , but no sign of the lean foreigner was ever unearthed .
when the doctor reached my house he found me unconscious in the sitting room in an with a table drawn up before it .
on the polished top were scratches showing where some heavy object had rested .
the queer machine was gone , nor was anything afterward heard of it .
undoubtedly the dark , lean foreigner had taken it away .
in the library grate were abundant ashes , evidently left from the burning of every remaining scrap of paper on which i had written since the advent of the amnesia .
dr wilson found my breathing very peculiar , but after a hypodermic injection it became more regular .
at , september , i stirred vigorously , and my hitherto masklike face began to show signs of expression .
dr wilson remarked that the expression was not that of my secondary personality , but seemed much like that of my normal self .
about i muttered some very curious syllables syllables which seemed unrelated to any human speech .
i appeared , too , to struggle against something .
then , just afternoon the housekeeper and the maid having meanwhile returned i began to mutter in
of the orthodox economists of that period , jevons typifies the prevailing trend toward scientific correlation .
his attempt to link the commercial cycle of prosperity and depression with the physical cycle of the solar spots forms perhaps the apex of nathaniel wingate peaslee had come back a spirit in whose time scale it was still thursday morning in , with the economics class gazing up at the battered desk on the platform .
my reabsorption into normal life was a painful and difficult process .
the loss of over five years creates more complications than can be imagined , and in my case there were countless matters to be adjusted .
what i heard of my actions since astonished and disturbed me , but i tried to view the matter as philosophically as i could .
at last , regaining custody of my second son , wingate , i settled down with him in the crane street house and endeavoured to resume my teaching my old professorship having been kindly offered me by the college .
i began work with the february , , term , and kept at it just a year .
by that time i realized how badly my experience had shaken me .
though perfectly sane i hoped and with no flaw in my original personality , i had not the nervous energy of the old days .
vague dreams and queer ideas continually haunted me , and when the outbreak of the world war turned my mind to history i found myself thinking of periods and events in the oddest possible fashion .
my conception of time , my ability to distinguish between consecutiveness and simultaneousness seemed subtly disordered so that i formed chimerical notions about living in one age and casting one mind all over eternity for knowledge of past and future ages .
the war gave me strange impressions of remembering some of its consequences as if i knew how it was coming out and could look back upon it in the light of future information .
all such were attended with much pain , and with a feeling that some artificial psychological barrier was set against them .
when i diffidently hinted to others about my impressions i met with varied responses .
some persons looked uncomfortably at me , but men in the mathematics department spoke of new developments in those theories of relativity then discussed only in learned circles which were later to become so famous .
albert einstein , they said , was rapidly reducing time to the status of a mere dimension .
but the dreams and disturbed feelings gained on me , so that i had to drop my regular work in .
certainly the impressions were taking an annoying shape giving me the persistent notion that my amnesia had formed some unholy sort of exchange ; that the secondary personality had indeed had had suffered displacement .
thus i was driven to vague and fright speculations concerning the whereabouts of my true self during the years that another had held my body .
the curious knowledge and strange conduct of my body late tenant troubled me more and more as i learned further details from persons , papers , and magazines .
queernesses that had baffled others seemed to harmonize terribly with some background of black knowledge which festered in the chasms of my subconscious .
i began to search feverishly for every scrap of information bearing on the studies and travels of that other one during the dark years .
not all of my troubles were as as this .
there were the dreams and these seemed to grow in vividness and concreteness .
knowing how most would regard them , i seldom mentioned them to anyone but my son or certain trusted psychologists , but eventually i commenced a scientific study of other cases in order to see how typical or nontypical such visions might be among amnesia victims .
my results , aided by psychologists , historians , anthropologists , and mental specialists of wide experience , and by a study that included all records of split personalities from the days of legends to the medically realistic present , at first bothered me more than they consoled me .
i soon found that my dreams had , indeed , no counterpart in the overwhelming bulk of true amnesia cases .
there remained , however , a tiny residue of accounts which for years baffled and shocked me with their parallelism to my own experience .
some of them were bits of ancient folklore ; others were case histories in the annals of medicine ; one or two were anecdotes obscurely buried in standard histories .
it thus appeared that , while my special kind of affliction was prodigiously rare , instances of it had occurred at long intervals ever since the beginning of men annals .
some centuries might contain one , two , or three cases , others none or at least none whose record survived .
the essence was always the same a person of keen thoughtfulness seized a strange secondary life and leading for a greater or lesser period an utterly alien existence typified at first by vocal and bodily awkwardness , and later by a wholesale acquisition of scientific , historic , artistic , and anthropologic knowledge ; an acquisition carried on with feverish zest and with a wholly abnormal absorptive power .
then a sudden return of rightful consciousness , intermittently plagued ever after with vague unplaceable dreams suggesting fragments of some hideous memory elaborately blotted out .
and the close resemblance of those nightmares to my own even in some of the smallest particulars left no doubt in my mind of their significantly typical nature .
one or two of the cases had an added ring of faint , blasphemous familiarity , as if i had heard of them before through some cosmic channel too morbid and frightful to contemplate .
in three instances there was specific mention of such an unknown machine as had been in my house before the second change .
another thing that worried me during my investigation was the somewhat greater frequency of cases where a brief , elusive glimpse of the typical nightmares was afforded to persons not visited with amnesia .
these persons were largely of mediocre mind or less some so primitive that they could scarcely be thought of as vehicles for abnormal scholarship and preternatural mental acquisitions .
for a second they would be fired with alien force then a backward lapse , and a thin , memory of unhuman horrors .
there had been at least three such cases during the past half century one only fifteen years before .
had something been groping blindly through time from some unsuspected abyss in nature ?
were these faint cases monstrous , sinister experiments of a kind and authorship utterly beyond sane belief ?
such were a few of the formless speculations of my weaker hours fancies abetted by myths which my studies uncovered .
for i could not doubt but that certain persistent legends of immemorial antiquity , apparently unknown to the victims and physicians connected with recent amnesia cases , formed a striking and awesome elaboration of memory lapses such as mine .
of the nature of the dreams and impressions which were growing so clamorous i still almost fear to speak .
they seemed to savor of madness , and at times i believed i was indeed going mad .
was there a special type of delusion afflicting those who had suffered lapses of memory ?
conceivably , the efforts of the subconscious mind to fill up a perplexing blank with might give rise to strange imaginative vagaries .
this indeed though an alternative folklore theory finally seemed to me more plausible was the belief of many of the alienists who helped me in my search for parallel cases , and who shared my puzzlement at the exact resemblances sometimes discovered .
they did not call the condition true insanity , but classed it rather among neurotic disorders .
my course in trying to track down and analyze it , instead of vainly seeking to dismiss or forget it , they heartily endorsed as correct according to the best psychological principles .
i especially valued the advice of such physicians as had studied me during my possession by the other personality .
my first disturbances were not visual at all , but concerned the more abstract matters which i have mentioned .
there was , too , a feeling of profound and inexplicable horror concerning myself .
i developed a queer fear of seeing my own form , as if my eyes would find it something utterly alien and inconceivably abhorrent .
when i did glance down and behold the familiar human shape in quiet grey or blue clothing , i always felt a curious relief , though in order to gain this relief i had to conquer an infinite dread .
i shunned mirrors as much as possible , and was always shaved at the barber .
it was a long time before i correlated any of these disappointed feelings with the fleeting visual impressions which began to develop .
the first such correlation had to do with the odd sensation of an external , artificial restraint on my memory .
i felt that the snatches of sight i experienced had a profound and terrible meaning , and a frightful connexion with myself , but that some purposeful influence held me from grasping that meaning and that connexion .
then came that queerness about the element of time , and with it desperate efforts to place the fragmentary in the chronological and spatial pattern .
the glimpses themselves were at first merely strange rather than horrible .
i would seem to be in an enormous vaulted chamber whose lofty stone groinings were lost in the shadows overhead .
in whatever time or place the scene might be , the principle of the arch was known as fully and used as extensively as by the romans .
there were colossal , round windows and high , arched doors , and pedestals or tables each as tall as the height of an ordinary room .
vast shelves of dark wood lined the walls , holding what seemed to be volumes of immense size with strange hieroglyphs on their backs .
the exposed stonework held curious carvings , always in curvilinear mathematical designs , and there were chiselled inscriptions in the same characters that the huge books bore .
the dark granite masonry was of a monstrous megathic type , with lines of blocks fitting the courses which rested upon them .
there were no chairs , but the tops of the vast pedestals were littered with books , papers , and what seemed to be writing materials oddly figured jars of a purplish metal , and rods with stained tips .
tall as the pedestals were , i seemed at times able to view them from above .
on some of them were great globes of luminous crystal serving as lamps , and inexplicable machines formed of vitreous tubes and metal rods .
the windows were glazed , and latticed with bars .
though i dared not approach and peer out them , i could see from where i was the waving tops of singular growths .
the floor was of massive octagonal flagstones , while rugs and hangings were entirely lacking .
later i had visions of sweeping through cyclopean corridors of stone , and up and down gigantic inclined planes of the same monstrous masonry .
there were no stairs anywhere , nor was any passageway less than thirty feet wide .
some of the structures through which i floated must have towered in the sky for thousands of feet .
there were multiple levels of black vaults below , and , sealed down with metal bands and holding dim suggestions of some special peril .
i seemed to be a prisoner , and horror hung broodingly over everything i saw .
i felt that the mocking curvilinear hieroglyphs on the walls would blast my soul with their message were i not guarded by a merciful ignorance .
still later my dreams included vistas from the great round windows , and from the titanic flat roof , with its curious gardens , wide barren area , and high , scalloped parapet of stone , to which the topmost of the inclined planes led .
there were , almost endless leagues of giant buildings , each in its garden , and ranged along paved roads fully feet wide .
they differed greatly in aspect , but few were less than feet square or a thousand feet high .
many seemed so limitless that they must have had a frontage of several thousand feet , while some shot up to mountainous altitudes in the grey , steamy heavens .
they seemed to be mainly of stone or concrete , and most of them embodied the oddly curvilinear type of masonry noticeable in the building that held me .
roofs were flat and , and tended to have scalloped parapets .
sometimes there were terraces and higher levels , and wide , cleared spaces amidst the gardens .
the great roads held hints of motion , but in the earlier visions i could not resolve this impression into details .
in certain places i beheld enormous dark cylindrical towers which climbed far above any of the other structures .
these appeared to be of a totally unique nature and shewed signs of prodigious age and dilapidation .
they were built of a bizarre type of basalt masonry , and tapered slightly toward their rounded tops .
nowhere in any of them could the least traces of windows or other apertures save huge doors be found .
i noticed also some lower buildings all crumbling with the weathering of aeons which resembled these dark , cylindrical towers in basic architecture .
around all these aberrant piles of masonry there hovered an inexplicable aura of menace and concentrated fear , like that bred by the sealed .
the omnipresent gardens were almost terrifying in their strangeness , with bizarre and unfamiliar forms of vegetation nodding over broad paths lined with curiously carven monoliths .
abnormally vast growths predominated some green , and some of a ghastly , fungoid pallor .
among them rose great spectral things resembling calamites , whose trunks towered to fabulous heights .
then there were tufted forms like fabulous cycads , and grotesque shrubs and trees of coniferous aspect .
flowers were small , colourless , and unrecognizable , blooming in geometrical beds and at large among the greenery .
in a few of the terrace and gardens were larger and more blossoms of most offensive contours and seeming to suggest artificial breeding .
fungi of inconceivable size , outlines , and colours speckled the scene in patterns bespeaking some unknown but horticultural tradition .
in the larger gardens on the ground there seemed to be some attempt to preserve the irregularities of nature , but on the roofs there was more selectiveness , and more evidences of the topiary art .
the skies were almost always moist and cloudy , and sometimes i would seem to witness tremendous rains .
once in a while , though , there would be glimpses of the sun which looked abnormally large and of the moon , whose markings held a touch of difference from the normal that i could never quite fathom .
when very rarely the night sky was clear to any extent , i beheld constellations which were nearly beyond recognition .
known outlines were sometimes approximated , but seldom duplicated ; and from the position of the few groups i could recognize , i felt i must be in the earth southern hemisphere , near the tropic of capricorn .
the far horizon was always steamy and indistinct , but i could see that great jungles of unknown , calamites , lepidodendra , and sigillaria lay outside the city , their fantastic frondage waving mockingly in the shifting vapours .
now and then there would be suggestions of motion in the sky , but these my early visions never resolved .
by the autumn of i began to have infrequent dreams of strange floatings over the city and through the regions around it .
i saw interminable roads through forests of fearsome growths with mottled , fluted , and banded trunks , and past other cities as strange as the one which persistently haunted me .
i saw monstrous constructions of black or iridescent tone in glades and clearings where perpetual twilight reigned , and traversed long causeways over swamps so dark that i could tell but little of their moist , towering vegetation .
once i saw an area of countless miles strewn with basaltic ruins whose architecture had been like that of the few windowless , towers in the haunting city .
and once i saw the sea a boundless , steamy expanse beyond the colossal stone piers of an enormous town of domes and arches .
great shapeless suggestions of shadow moved over it , and here and there its surface was vexed with anomalous spoutings .
as i have said , it was not immediately that these wild visions began to hold their terrifying quality .
certainly , many persons have dreamed intrinsically stranger things things compounded of unrelated scraps of daily life , pictures , and reading , and arranged in fantastically novel forms by the unchecked caprices of sleep .
for some time i accepted the visions as natural , even though i had never before been an extravagant dreamer .
many of the vague anomalies , i argued , must have come from trivial sources too numerous to track down ; while others seemed to reflect a common text book knowledge of the plants and other conditions of the primitive world of a hundred and fifty million years ago the world of the permian or triassic age .
in the course of some months , however , the element of terror did figure with accumulating force .
this was when the dreams began so unfailingly to have the aspect of memories , and when my mind began to link them with my growing abstract disturbances the feeling of mnemonic restraint , the curious impressions regarding time , and sense of a loathsome exchange with my secondary personality of , and , considerably later , the inexplicable loathing of my own person .
as certain definite details began to enter the dreams , their horror increased a thousandfold until by october , , i felt i must do something .
it was then that i began an intensive study of other cases of amnesia and visions , feeling that i might thereby objectivise my trouble and shake clear of its emotional grip .
however , as before mentioned , the result was at first almost exactly opposite .
it disturbed me vastly to find that my dreams had been so closely duplicated ; especially since some of the accounts were too early to admit of any geological knowledge and therefore of any idea of primitive landscapes on the subjects ' part .
what is more , many of these accounts supplied very horrible details and explanations in connexion with the visions of great buildings and jungle gardens and other things .
the actual sights and vague impressions were bad enough , but what was hinted or asserted by some of the other dreamers savored of madness and blasphemy .
worst of all , my own was aroused to milder dreams and hints of coming revelations .
and yet most doctors deemed my course , on the whole , an advisable one .
i studied psychology systematically , and under the prevailing stimulus my son wingate did the same his studies leading eventually to his present professorship .
in and i took special courses at miskatonic .
meanwhile , my examination of medical , historical , and anthropological records became indefatigable , involving travels to distant libraries , and finally including even a reading of the hideous books of forbidden elder lore in which my secondary personality had been so disturbingly interested .
some of the latter were the actual copies i had consulted in my altered state , and i was greatly disturbed by certain marginal notations and ostensible corrections of the hideous text in a script and idiom which somehow seemed oddly unhuman .
these markings were mostly in the respective languages of the various books , all of which the writer seemed to know with equal , though obviously academic , facility .
one note appended to von junzt unaussprechlichen kulten , however , was alarmingly otherwise .
it consisted of certain curvilinear hieroglyphs in the same ink as that of the german corrections , but following no recognized human pattern .
and these hieroglyphs were closely and unmistakably akin to the characters constantly met with in my dreams characters whose meaning i would sometimes momentarily fancy i knew , or was just on the brink of recalling .
to complete my black confusion , my librarians assured me that , in view of previous examinations and records of consultation of the volumes in question , all of these notations must have been made by myself in my secondary state .
this despite the fact that i was and still am ignorant of three of the languages involved .
piecing together the scattered records , ancient and modern , anthropological and medical , i found a fairly consistent mixture of myth and hallucination whose scope and wildness left me utterly dazed .
only one thing consoled me , the fact that the myths were of such early existence .
what lost knowledge could have brought pictures of the palaeozoic or mesozoic landscape into these primitive fables , i could not even guess ; but the pictures had been there .
thus , a basis existed for the formation of a fixed type of delusion .
cases of amnesia no doubt created the general myth pattern but afterward the fanciful accretions of the myths must have reacted on amnesia sufferers and coloured their .
i myself had read and heard all the early tales during my memory lapse my quest had amply proved that .
was it not natural , then , for my subsequent dreams and emotional impressions to become coloured and moulded by what my memory subtly held over from my secondary state ?
a few of the myths had significant connexions with other cloudy legends of the world , especially those hindu tales involving stupefying gulfs of time and forming part of the lore of modern theosopists .
primal myth and modern delusion joined in their assumption that mankind is only one perhaps the least of the highly evolved and dominant races of this planet long and largely unknown career .
things of inconceivable shape , they implied , had reared towers to the sky and delved into every secret of nature before the first amphibian forbear of man had crawled out of the hot sea million years ago .
some had come down from the stars ; a few were as old as the cosmos itself , others had arisen swiftly from terrene germs as far behind the first germs of our as those germs are behind ourselves .
spans of thousands of millions of years , and linkages to other galaxies and universes , were freely spoken of .
indeed , there was no such thing as time in its humanly accepted sense .
but most of the tales and impressions concerned a relatively late race , of a queer and intricate shape , resembling no known to science , which had lived till only fifty million years before the advent of man .
this , they indicated , was the greatest race of all because it alone had conquered the secret of time .
it had learned all things that ever were known or ever would be known on the earth , through the power of its keener minds to project themselves into the past and future , even through gulfs of millions of years , and study the lore of every age .
from the accomplishments of this race arose all legends of prophets , including those in human mythology .
in its vast libraries were volumes of texts and pictures holding the whole of earth annals histories and descriptions of every species that had ever been or that ever would be , with full records of their arts , their achievements , their languages , and their psychologies .
with this knowledge , the great race chose from every era and such thoughts , arts , and processes as might suit its own nature and situation .
knowledge of the past , secured through a kind of outside the recognized senses , was harder to glean than knowledge of the future .
in the latter case the course was easier and more material .
with suitable mechanical aid a mind would project itself forward in time , feeling its dim , way till it approached the desired period .
then , after preliminary trials , it would seize on the best discoverable representative of the highest of that period .
it would enter the organism brain and set up therein its own vibrations , while the displaced mind would strike back to the period of the displacer , remaining in the latter body till a reverse process was set up .
the projected mind , in the body of the organism of the future , would then pose as a member of the race whose outward form it wore , learning as quickly as possible all that could be learned of the chosen age and its massed information and techniques .
meanwhile the displaced mind , thrown back to the displacer age and body , would be carefully guarded .
it would be kept from harming the body it occupied , and would be drained of all its knowledge by trained questioners .
often it could be questioned in its own language , when previous quests into the future had brought back records of that language .
if the mind came from a body whose language the great race could not physically reproduce , clever machines would be made , on which the alien speech could be played as on a musical instrument .
the great race members were immense rugose cones ten feet high , and with head and other organs attached to , distensible limbs spreading from the apexes .
they spoke by the clicking or scraping of huge paws or claws attached to the end of two of their four limbs , and walked by the expansion and contraction of a viscous layer attached to their vast , bases .
when the captive mind amazement and resentment had worn off , and when assuming that it came from a body vastly different from the great race it had lost its horror at its unfamiliar temporary form , it was permitted to study its new environment and experience a wonder and wisdom approximating that of its displacer .
with suitable precautions , and in exchange for suitable services , it was allowed to rove all over the habitable world in titan airships or on the huge boatlike vehicles which traversed the great roads , and to delve freely into the libraries containing the records of the planet past and future .
this reconciled many captive minds to their lot ; since none were other than keen , and to such minds the unveiling of hidden mysteries of chapters of inconceivable pasts and dizzying vortices of future time which include the years ahead of their own natural always , despite the abysmal horrors often unveiled , the supreme experience of life .
now and then certain captives were permitted to meet other captive minds seized from the future to exchange thoughts with consciousnesses living a hundred or a thousand or a million years before or after their own ages .
and all were urged to write copiously in their own languages of themselves and their respective periods ; such documents to be filed in the great central archives .
it may be added that there was one special type of captive whose privileges were far greater than those of the majority .
these were the dying permanent exiles , whose bodies in the future had been seized by members of the great race who , faced with death , sought to escape mental extinction .
such melancholy exiles were not as common as might be expected , since the longevity of the great race lessened its love of life especially among those superior minds capable of projection .
from cases of the permanent projection of elder minds arose many of those lasting changes of personality noticed in later history including mankind .
as for the ordinary cases of exploration when the displacing mind had learned what it wished in the future , it would build an apparatus like that which had started its flight and reverse the process of projection .
once more it would be in its own body in its own age , while the lately captive mind would return to that body of the future to which it properly belonged .
only when one or the other of the bodies had died during the exchange was this restoration impossible .
in such cases , of course , the exploring mind had like those of the to live out an life in the future ; or else the captive mind like the dying permanent exiles had to end its days in the form and past age of the great race .
this fate was least horrible when the captive mind was also of the great race a not infrequent occurrence , since in all its periods that race was intensely concerned with its own future .
the number of dying permanent exiles of the great race was very slight largely because of the tremendous penalties attached to displacements of future great race minds by the moribund .
through projection , arrangements were made to inflict these penalties on the offending minds in their new future bodies and sometimes forced reëxchanges were effected .
complex cases of the displacement of exploring or already captive minds by minds in various regions of the past had been known and carefully rectified .
in every age since the discovery of mind projection , a minute but element of the population consisted of great race minds from past ages , sojourning for a longer or shorter while .
when a captive mind of alien origin was returned to its own body in the future , it was purged by an intricate mechanical hypnosis of all it had learned in the great race age this because of certain troublesome consequences inherent in the general carrying forward of knowledge in large quantities .
the few existing instances of clear transmission had caused , and would cause at known future times , great disasters .
and it was largely in consequence of two cases of this kind said the old myths that mankind had learned what it had concerning the great race .
of all things surviving physically and directly from that world , there remained only certain ruins of great stones in far places and under the sea , and parts of the text of the frightful pnakotic manuscripts .
thus the returning mind reached its own age with only the faintest and most fragmentary visions of what it had undergone since its seizure .
all memories that could be eradicated were eradicated , so that in most cases only a blank stretched back to the time of the first exchange .
some minds recalled more than others , and the chance joining of memories had at rare times brought hints of the forbidden past to future ages .
there probably never was a time when groups or cults did not secretly cherish certain of these hints .
in the necronomicon the presence of such a cult among human beings was suggested a cult that sometimes gave aid to minds voyaging down the aeons from the days of the great race .
and , meanwhile , the great race itself waxed omniscient , and turned to the task of setting up exchanges with the minds of other planets , and of exploring their pasts and futures .
it sought likewise to fathom the past years and origin of that black , orb in far space whence its own mental heritage had come for the mind of the great race was older than its bodily form .
the beings of a dying elder world , wise with the ultimate secrets , had looked ahead for a new world and species wherein they might have long life ; and had sent their minds en masse into that future race best adapted to house them the beings that peopled our earth a billion years ago .
thus the great race came to be , while the myriad minds sent backward were left to die in the horror of strange shapes .
later the race would again face death , yet would live through another forward migration of its best minds into the bodies of others who had a longer physical span ahead of them .
such was the background of intertwined legend and hallucination .
when , around , i had my researches in coherent shape , i felt a slight lessening of the tension which their earlier stages had increased .
after all , and in spite of the fancies prompted by blind emotions , were not most of my phenomena readily explainable ?
any chance might have turned my mind to dark studies during the amnesia and then i read the forbidden legends and met the members of ancient and cults .
that , plainly , supplied the material for the dreams and disturbed feelings which came after the return of memory .
as for the marginal notes in and languages unknown to me , but laid at my door by librarians i might easily have picked up a smattering of the tongues during my secondary state , while the hieroglyphs were doubtless coined by my fancy from descriptions in old legends , and afterward woven into my dreams .
i tried to verify certain points through conversation with known cult leaders , but never succeeded in establishing the right connexions .
at times the parallelism of so many cases in so many distant ages continued to worry me as it had at first , but on the other hand i reflected that the excitant folklore was undoubtedly more universal in the past than in the present .
probably all the other victims whose cases were like mine had had a long and familiar knowledge of the tales i had learned only when in my secondary state .
when these victims had lost their memory , they had associated themselves with the creatures of their household myths the fabulous invaders supposed to displace men minds and had thus embarked upon quests for knowledge which they thought they could take back to a fancied , past .
then , when their memory returned , they reversed the associative process and thought of themselves as the former captive minds instead of as the displacers .
hence the dreams and following the conventional myth pattern .
despite the seeming cumbrousness of these explanations , they came finally to supersede all others in my mind largely because of the greater weakness of any rival theory .
and a substantial number of eminent psychologists and anthropologists gradually agreed with me .
the more i reflected , the more convincing did my reasoning seem ; till in the end i had a really effective bulwark against the visions and impressions which still assailed me .
suppose i did see strange things at night ?
these were only what i had heard and read of .
suppose i did have odd loathings and perspectives and ?
these , too , were only echoes of myths absorbed in my secondary state .
nothing that i might dream , nothing that i might feel , could be of any actual significance .
fortified by this philosophy , i greatly improved in nervous equilibrium , even though the visions rather than the abstract impressions steadily became more frequent and more disturbingly detailed .
in i felt able to undertake regular work again , and put my newly gained knowledge to practical use by accepting an instructorship in psychology at the university .
my old chair of political economy had long been adequately filled besides which , methods of teaching economics had changed greatly since my heyday .
my son was at this time just entering on the studies leading to his present professorship , and we worked together a great deal .
i continued , however , to keep a careful record of the outré dreams which crowded upon me so thickly and vividly .
such a record , i argued , was of genuine value as a psychological document .
the glimpses still seemed damnably like memories , though i fought off this impression with a goodly measure of success .
in writing , i treated the phantasmata as things seen ; but at all other times i brushed them aside like any gossamer illusions of the night .
i had never mentioned such matters in common conversation ; though reports of them , filtering out as such things will , had aroused sundry rumors regarding my mental health .
it is amusing to reflect that these rumors were confined wholly to laymen , without a single champion among physicians or psychologists .
of my visions after i will here mention only a few , since fuller accounts and records are at the disposal of the serious student .
it is evident that with time the curious inhibitions somewhat waned , for the scope of my visions vastly increased .
they have never , though , become other than disjointed fragments seemingly without clear motivation .
within the dreams i seemed gradually to acquire a greater and greater freedom of wandering .
i floated through many strange buildings of stone , going from one to the other along mammoth underground passages which seemed to form the common avenues of transit .
sometimes i encountered those gigantic sealed in the lowest level , around which such an aura of fear and forbiddenness clung .
i saw tremendously tessellated pools , and rooms of curious and inexplicable utensils of myriad sorts .
then there were colossal caverns of intricate machinery whose outlines and purpose were wholly strange to me , and whose sound manifested itself only after many years of dreaming .
i may here remark that sight and sound are the only senses i have ever exercised in the visionary world .
the real horror began in may , , when i first saw the living things .
this was before my studies had taught me what , in view of the myths and case histories , to expect .
as mental barriers wore down , i beheld great masses of thin vapour in various parts of the building and in the streets below .
these steadily grew more solid and distinct , till at last i could trace their monstrous outlines with uncomfortable ease .
they seemed to be enormous , iridescent cones , about ten feet high and ten feet wide at the base , and made up of some ridgy , scaly , matter .
from their apexes projected four flexible , cylindrical members , each a foot thick , and of a ridgy substance like that of the cones themselves .
these members were sometimes contracted almost to nothing , and sometimes extended to any distance up to about ten feet .
terminating two of them were enormous claws or nippers .
at the end of a third were four red , trumpetlike appendages .
the fourth terminated in an irregular yellowish globe some two feet in diameter and having three great dark eyes ranged along its central circumference .
surmounting this head were four slender grey stalks bearing appendages , whilst from its nether side dangled eight greenish antennae or tentacles .
the great base of the central cone was fringed with a rubbery , grey substance which moved the whole entity through expansion and contraction .
their actions , though harmless , horrified me even more than their appearance for it is not wholesome to watch monstrous objects doing what one had known only human beings to do .
these objects moved intelligently about the great rooms , getting books from the shelves and taking them to the great tables , or vice versa , and sometimes writing diligently with a peculiar rod gripped in the greenish head tentacles .
the huge nippers were used in carrying books and in consisting of a kind of clicking and scraping .
the objects had no clothing , but wore satchels or knapsacks suspended from the top of the conical trunk .
they commonly carried their head and its supporting member at the level of the cone top , although it was frequently raised or lowered .
the other three great members tended to rest downward at the sides of the cone , contracted to about five feet each when not in use .
from their rate of reading , writing , and operating their machines those on the tables seemed somehow connected with thought i concluded that their intelligence was enormously greater than man .
afterward i saw them everywhere ; swarming in all the great chambers and corridors , tending monstrous machines in vaulted crypts , and racing along the vast roads in gigantic , cars .
i ceased to be afraid of them , for they seemed to form supremely natural parts of their environment .
individual differences amongst them began to be manifest , and a few appeared to be under some kind of restraint .
these latter , though shewing no physical variation , had a diversity of gestures and habits which marked them off not only from the majority , but very largely from one another .
they wrote a great deal in what seemed to my cloudy vision a vast variety of characters never the typical curvilinear hieroglyphs of the majority .
a few , i fancied , used our own familiar alphabet .
most of them worked much more slowly than the general mass of the entities .
all this time my own part in the dreams seemed to be that of a disembodied consciousness with a range of vision wider than the normal , floating freely about , yet confined to the ordinary avenues and speeds of travel .
not until august , , did any suggestions of bodily existence begin to harass me .
i say harass , because the first phase was a purely abstract , though infinitely terrible , association of my previously noted body loathing with the scenes of my visions .
for a while my chief concern during dreams was to avoid looking down at myself , and i recall how grateful i was for the total absence of large mirrors in the strange rooms .
i was mightily troubled by the fact that i always saw the great tables whose height could not be under ten feet from a level not below that of their surfaces .
and then the morbid temptation to look down at myself became greater and greater , till one night i could not resist it .
at first my downward glance revealed nothing whatever .
a moment later i perceived that this was because my head lay at the end of a flexible neck of enormous length .
retracting this neck and gazing down very sharply , i saw the scaly , rugose , iridescent bulk of a vast cone ten feet tall and ten feet wide at the base .
that was when i waked half of arkham with my screaming as i plunged madly up from the abyss of sleep .
only after weeks of hideous repetition did i grow to these visions of myself in monstrous form .
in the dreams i now moved bodily among the other unknown entities , reading terrible books from the endless shelves and writing for hours at the great tables with a stylus managed by the green tentacles that hung down from my head .
snatches of what i read and wrote would linger in my memory .
there were horrible annals of other worlds and other universes , and of stirrings of formless life outside of all universes .
there were records of strange orders of beings which had peopled the world in forgotten pasts , and frightful chronicles of intelligences which would people it millions of years after the death of the last human being .
i learned of chapters in human history whose existence no scholar of today has ever suspected .
most of these writings were in the language of the hieroglyphs ; which i studied in a queer way with the aid of droning machines , and which was evidently an agglutinative speech with root systems utterly unlike any found in human languages .
other volumes were in other unknown tongues learned in the same queer way .
a very few were in languages i knew .
extremely clever pictures , both inserted in the records and forming separate collections , aided me immensely .
and all the time i seemed to be setting down a history of my own age in english .
on waking , i could recall only minute and meaningless scraps of the unknown tongues which my had mastered , though whole phrases of the history stayed with me .
i learned even before my waking self had studied the parallel cases or the old myths from which the dreams doubtless sprang that the entities around me were of the world greatest race , which had conquered time and had sent exploring minds into every age .
i knew , too , that i had been snatched from my age while another used my body in that age , and that a few of the other strange forms housed similarly captured minds .
i seemed to talk , in some odd language of claw clickings , with exiled intellects from every corner of the solar system .
there was a mind from the planet we know as venus , which would live incalculable epochs to come , and one from an outer moon of jupiter six million years in the past .
of earthly minds there were some from the winged , , race of palaeogean antarctica ; one from the reptile people of fabled valusia ; three from the furry hyperborean worshippers of tsathoggua ; one from the wholly abominable ; two from the arachnid denizens of earth last age ; five from the hardy coleopterous species immediately following mankind , to which the great race was some day to transfer its keenest minds en masse in the face of horrible peril ; and several from different branches of humanity .
i talked with the mind of , a philosopher from the cruel empire of , which is to come in ; with that of a general of the greatheaded brown people who held south africa in .
; with that of a florentine monk named bartolomeo corsi ; with that of a king of lomar who had ruled that terrible polar land one hundred thousand years before the squat , yellow inutos came from the west to engulf it .
i talked with the mind of , a magician of the dark conquerors of ; with that of a roman named titus sempronius blaesus , who had been a quaestor in sulla time ; with that of khephnes , an egyptian of the dynasty , who told me the hideous secret of nyarlathotep , with that of a priest of atlantis ' middle kingdom ; with that of a suffolk gentleman of cromwell day , james woodville ; with that of a court astronomer of peru ; with that of the australian physicist nevil , who will die in ; with that of an archimage of vanished yhe in the pacific ; with that of theodotides , a official of .
; with that of an aged frenchman of louis time named montagny ; with that of , a cimmerian chieftain of .
; and with so many others that my brain can not hold the shocking secrets and dizzying marvels i learned from them .
i awaked each morning in a fever , sometimes frantically trying to verify or discredit such information as fell within the range of modern human knowledge .
traditional facts took on new and doubtful aspects , and i marvelled at the which could invent such surprising addenda to history and science .
i shivered at the mysteries the past may conceal , and trembled at the menaces the future may bring forth .
what was hinted in the speech of entities of the fate of mankind produced such an effect on me that i will not set it down here .
after man there would be the mighty beetle civilisation , the bodies of whose members the cream of the great race would seize when the monstrous doom overtook the elder world .
later , as the earth span closed , the transferred minds would again migrate through time and space to another in the bodies of the bulbous vegetable entities of mercury .
but there would be races after them , clinging pathetically to the cold planet and burrowing to its core , before the utter end .
meanwhile , in my dreams , i wrote endlessly in that history of my own age which i was preparing half voluntarily and half through promises of increased library and travel opportunities for the great race central archives .
the archives were in a colossal subterranean structure near the city center , which i came to know well through frequent labors and consultations .
meant to last as long as the race , and to withstand the fiercest of earth convulsions , this titan repository surpassed all other buildings in the massive , firmness of its construction .
the records , written or printed on great sheets of a curiously tenacious cellulose fabric were bound into books that opened from the top , and were kept in individual cases of a strange , extremely light , rustless metal of greyish hue , decorated with mathematical designs and bearing the title in the great race curvilinear hieroglyphs .
these cases were stored in tiers of rectangular vaults like closed , locked shelves wrought of the same rustless metal and fastened by knobs with intricate turnings .
my own history was assigned a specific place in the vaults of the lowest or vertebrate level the section devoted to the culture of mankind and of the furry and reptilian races immediately preceding it in terrestrial dominance .
but none of the dreams ever gave me a full picture of daily life .
all were the merest misty , disconnected fragments , and it is certain that these fragments were not unfolded in their rightful sequence .
i have , for example , a very imperfect idea of my own living arrangements in the ; though i seem to have possessed a great stone room of my own .
my restrictions as a prisoner gradually disappeared , so that some of the visions included vivid travels over the mighty jungle roads , sojourns in strange cities , and explorations of some of the vast , dark , windowless ruins from which the great race shrank in curious fear .
there were also long sea voyages in enormous , boats of incredible swiftness , and trips over wild regions in closed airships lifted and moved by electrical repulsion .
beyond the wide , warm ocean were other cities of the great race , and on one far continent i saw the crude villages of the , winged creatures who would evolve as a dominant stock after the great race had sent its foremost minds into the future to escape the creeping horror .
flatness and exuberant green life were always the keynote of the scene .
hills were low and sparse , and usually displayed signs of volcanic forces .
of the animals i saw , i could write volumes .
all were wild ; for the great race mechanised culture had long since done away with domestic beasts , while food was wholly vegetable or synthetic .
clumsy reptiles of great bulk floundered in steaming morasses , fluttered in the heavy air , or spouted in the seas and lakes ; and among these i fancied i could vaguely recognise lesser , archaic prototypes of many forms dinosaurs , pterodactyls , ichthyosaurs , labyrinthodonts , plesiosaurs , and the familiar through palaeontology .
of birds or mammals there were none that i could discover .
the ground and swamps were constantly alive with snakes , lizards , and crocodiles while insects buzzed incessantly among the lush vegetation .
and far out at sea , unspied and unknown monsters spouted mountainous columns of foam into the vaporous sky .
once i was taken under the ocean in a gigantic submarine vessel with searchlights , and glimpsed some living horrors of awesome magnitude .
i saw also the ruins of incredible sunken cities , and the wealth of crinoid , brachiopod , coral , and ichthyic life which everywhere abounded .
of the physiology , psychology , folkways , and detailed history of the great race my visions preserved but little information , and many of the scattered points i here set down were gleaned from my study of old legends and other cases rather than from my own dreaming .
for in time , of course , my reading and research caught up with and passed the dreams in many phases , so that certain were explained in advance and formed verifications of what i had learned .
this consolingly established my belief that similar reading and research , accomplished by my secondary self , had formed the source of the whole terrible fabric of pseudomemories .
the period of my dreams , apparently , was one somewhat less than years ago , when the palaeozoic age was giving place to the mesozoic .
the bodies occupied by the great race represented no surviving or even scientifically known line of terrestrial evolution , but were of a peculiar , closely homogeneous , and highly specialised organic type inclining as much as to the vegetable as to the animal state .
cell action was of an unique sort almost precluding fatigue , and wholly eliminating the need of sleep .
nourishment , assimilated through the red appendages on one of the great flexible limbs , was always semifluid and in many aspects wholly unlike the food of existing animals .
the beings had but two of the senses which we recognise sight and hearing , the latter accomplished through the appendages on the grey stalks above their heads .
of other and incomprehensible senses not , however , well utilizable by alien captive minds inhabiting their bodies they possessed many .
their three eyes were so situated as to give them a range of vision wider than the normal .
their blood was a sort of ichor of great thickness .
they had no sex , but reproduced through seeds or spores which clustered on their bases and could be developed only under water .
great , shallow tanks were used for the growth of their young which were , however , reared only in small numbers on account of the longevity of individuals four or five thousand years being the common life span .
markedly defective individuals were quickly disposed of as soon as their defects were noticed .
disease and the approach of death were , in the absence of a sense of touch or of physical pain , recognised by purely visual symptoms .
the dead were incinerated with dignified ceremonies .
once in a while , as before mentioned , a keen mind would escape death by forward projection in time ; but such cases were not numerous .
when one did occur , the exiled mind from the future was treated with the utmost kindness till the dissolution of its unfamiliar tenement .
the great race seemed to form a single , loosely knit nation or league , with major institutions in common , though there were four definite divisions .
the political and economic system of each unit was a sort of fascistic socialism , with major resources rationally distributed , and power delegated to a small governing board elected by the votes of all able to pass certain educational and psychological tests .
family organisation was not overstressed , though ties among persons of common descent were recognised , and the young were generally reared by their parents .
resemblances to human attitudes and institutions were , of course , most marked in those fields where on the one hand highly abstract elements were concerned , or where on the other hand there was a dominance of the basic , unspecialised urges common to all organic life .
a few added likenesses came through conscious adoption as the great race probed the future and copied what it liked .
industry , highly mechanised , demanded but little time from each citizen ; and the abundant leisure was filled with intellectual and aesthetic activities of various sorts .
the sciences were carried to an unbelievable height of development , and art was a vital part of life , though at the period of my dreams it had passed its crest and meridian .
technology was enormously stimulated through the constant struggle to survive , and to keep in existence the physical fabric of great cities , imposed by the prodigious geologic upheavals of those primal days .
crime was surprisingly scant , and was dealt with through highly efficient policing .
punishments ranged from privilege deprivation and imprisonment to death or major emotion wrenching , and were never administered without a careful study of the criminal motivations .
warfare , largely civil for the last few millennia though sometimes waged against reptilian or octopodic invaders , or against the winged , old ones who centered in the antarctic , was infrequent though infinitely devastating .
an enormous army , using weapons which produced tremendous electrical effects , was kept on hand for purposes seldom mentioned , but obviously connected with the ceaseless fear of the dark , windowless elder ruins and of the great sealed in the lowest subterranean levels .
this fear of the basalt ruins and was largely a matter of unspoken suggestion or , at most , of furtive .
everything specific which bore on it was significantly absent from such books as were on the common shelves .
it was the one subject lying altogether under a taboo among the great race , and seemed to be connected alike with horrible bygone struggles , and with that future peril which would some day force the race to send its keener minds ahead en masse in time .
imperfect and fragmentary as were the other things presented by dreams and legends , this matter was still more bafflingly shrouded .
the vague old myths avoided it or perhaps all allusions had for some reason been excised .
and in the dreams of myself and others , the hints were peculiarly few .
members of the great race never intentionally referred to the matter , and what could be gleaned came only from some of the more sharply observant captive minds .
according to these scraps of information , the basis of the fear was a horrible elder race of , utterly alien entities which had come through space from immeasurably distant universes and had dominated the earth and three other solar planets about million years ago .
they were only partly material as we understand matter and their type of consciousness and media of perception differed widely from those of terrestrial organisms .
for example , their senses did not include that of sight ; their mental world being a strange , pattern of impressions .
they were , however , sufficiently material to use implements of normal matter when in cosmic areas containing it ; and they required housing albeit of a peculiar kind .
though their senses could penetrate all material barriers , their substance could not ; and certain forms of electrical energy could wholly destroy them .
they had the power of aërial motion , despite the absence of wings or any other visible means of levitation .
their minds were of such texture that no exchange with them could be effected by the great race .
when these things had come to the earth they had built mighty basalt cities of windowless towers , and had preyed horribly upon the beings they found .
thus it was when the minds of the great race sped across the void from that obscure , world known in the disturbing and debatable eltdown shards as yith .
the newcomers , with the instruments they created , had found it easy to subdue the predatory entities and drive them down to those caverns of inner earth which they had already joined to their abodes and begun to inhabit .
then they had sealed the entrances and left them to their fate , afterward occupying most of their great cities and preserving certain important buildings for reasons connected more with superstition than with indifference , boldness , or scientific and historical zeal .
but as the aeons passed there came vague , evil signs that the elder things were growing strong and numerous in the inner world .
there were sporadic irruptions of a particularly hideous character in certain small and remote cities of the great race , and in some of the deserted elder cities which the great race had not peopled places where the paths to the gulfs below had not been properly sealed or guarded .
after that greater precautions were taken , and many of the paths were closed forever though a few were left with sealed for strategic use in fighting the elder things if ever they broke forth in unexpected places .
the irruptions of the elder things must have been shocking beyond all description , since they had permanently coloured the psychology of the great race .
such was the fixed mood of horror that the very aspect of the creatures was left unmentioned .
at no time was i able to gain a clear hint of what they looked like .
there were veiled suggestions of a monstrous plasticity , and of temporary lapses of visibility , while other fragmentary whispers referred to their control and military use of great winds .
singular whistling noises , and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe marks , seemed also to be associated with them .
it was evident that the coming doom so desperately feared by the great race the doom that was one day to send millions of keen minds across the chasm of time to strange bodies in the safer future had to do with a final successful irruption of the elder beings .
mental projections down the ages had clearly foretold such a horror , and the great race had resolved that none who could escape should face it .
that the foray would be a matter of vengeance , rather than an attempt to reoccupy the outer world , they knew from the planet later history for their projections shewed the coming and going of subsequent races untroubled by the monstrous entities .
perhaps these entities had come to prefer earth inner abysses to the variable , surface , since light meant nothing to them .
perhaps , too , they were slowly weakening with the aeons .
indeed , it was known that they would be quite dead in the time of the beetle race which the fleeing minds would tenant .
meanwhile , the great race maintained its cautious vigilance , with potent weapons ceaselessly ready despite the horrified banishing of the subject from common speech and visible records .
and always the shadow of nameless fear hung bout the sealed and the dark , windowless elder towers .
v that is the world of which my dreams brought me dim , scattered echoes every night .
i can not hope to give any true idea of the horror and dread contained in such echoes , for it was upon a wholly intangible quality the sharp sense of that such feelings mainly depended .
as i have said , my studies gradually gave me a defence against these feelings in the form of rational psychological explanations ; and this saving influence was augmented by the subtle touch of accustomedness which comes with the passage of time .
yet in spite of everything the vague , creeping terror would return momentarily now and then .
it did not , however , engulf me as it had before ; and after i lived a very normal life of work and recreation .
in the course of years i began to feel that my experience together with the kindred cases and the related folklore ought to be definitely summarised and published for the benefit of serious students ; hence i prepared a series of articles briefly covering the whole ground and illustrated with crude sketches of some of the shapes , scenes , decorative motifs , and hieroglyphs remembered from the dreams .
these appeared at various times during and in the journal of the american psychological society , but did not attract much attention .
meanwhile i continued to record my dreams with the minutest care , even though the growing stack of reports attained troublesomely vast proportions .
on july , , there was forwarded to me by the psychological society the letter which opened the culminating and most horrible phase of the whole mad ordeal .
it was postmarked pilbarra , western australia , and bore the signature of one whom i found , upon inquiry , to be a mining engineer of considerable prominence .
enclosed were some very curious snapshots .
i will reproduce the text in its entirety , and no reader can fail to understand how tremendous an effect it and the photographs had upon me .
i was , for a time , almost stunned and incredulous ; for although i had often thought that some basis of fact must underlie certain phases of the legends which had coloured my dreams , i was none the less unprepared for anything like a tangible survival from a lost world remote beyond all imagination .
most devastating of all were the photographs for here , in cold , incontrovertible realism , there stood out against a background of sand certain , , blocks of stone whose slightly convex tops and slightly concave bottoms told their own story .
and when i studied them with a magnifying glass i could see all too plainly , amidst the batterings and pittings , the traces of those vast curvilinear designs and occasional hieroglyphs whose significance had become so hideous to me .
but here is the letter , which speaks for itself .
, dampier , pilbarra , australia , may , .
w peaslee , am .
psychological society , , new york city , my dear sir a recent conversation with boyle of perth , and some papers with your articles which he has just sent me , make it advisable for me to tell you about certain things i have seen in the great sandy desert east of our gold field here .
it would seem , in view of the peculiar legends about old cities with huge stonework and strange designs and hieroglyphs which you describe , that i have come upon something very important .
the blackfellows have always been full of talk about great stones with marks on them , and seem to have a terrible fear of such things .
they connect them in some way with their common racial legends about buddai , the gigantic old man who lies asleep for ages underground with his head on his arm , and who will some day awake and eat up the world .
there are some very old and tales of enormous underground huts of great stones , where passages lead down and down , and where horrible things have happened .
the blackfellows claim that once some warriors , fleeing in battle , went down into one and never came back , but that frightful winds began to blow from the place soon after they went down .
however , there usually is much in what these natives say .
but what i have to tell is more than this .
two years ago , when i was prospecting about miles east in the desert , i came on a lot of queer pieces of dressed stone perhaps x x feet in size , and weathered and pitted to the very limit .
at first i could find any of the marks the blackfellows told about , but when i looked close enough i could make out some deeply carved lines in spite of the weathering .
there were peculiar curves , just like what the blackfellows had tried to describe .
i imagine there must have been thirty or forty blocks , some nearly buried in the sand , and all within a circle perhaps a quarter of a mile in diameter .
when i saw some , i looked around closely for more , and made a careful reckoning of the place with my instruments .
i also took pictures of ten or twelve of the most typical blocks , and will enclose the prints for you to see .
i turned my information and pictures over to the government at perth , but they have done nothing about them .
then i met boyle , who had read your articles in the journal of the american psychological society , and , in time , happened to mention the stones .
he was enormously interested , and became quite excited when i shewed him my snapshots , saying that the stones and the markings were just like those of the masonry you had dreamed about and seen described in legends .
he meant to write you , but was delayed .
meanwhile , he sent me most of the magazines with your articles , and i saw at once , from your drawings and descriptions , that my stones are certainly the kind you mean .
you can appreciate this from the enclosed prints .
later on you will hear directly from boyle .
now i can understand how important all this will be to you .
without question we are faced with the remains of an unknown civilization older than any dreamed of before , and forming a basis for your legends .
as a mining engineer , i have some knowledge of geology , and can tell you that these blocks are so ancient they frighten me .
they are mostly sandstone and granite , though one is almost certainly made of a queer sort of cement or concrete .
they bear evidence of water action , as if this part of the world had been submerged and come up again after long ages all since those blocks were made and used .
it is a matter of hundreds of thousands of years or heaven knows how much more .
i do like to think about it .
in view of your previous diligent work in tracking down the legends and everything connected with them , i can not doubt but that you will want to lead an expedition to the desert and make some archaeological excavations .
both boyle and i are prepared to cooperate in such work if you or organizations known to you can furnish the funds .
i can get together a dozen miners for the heavy digging the blackfellows would be of no use , for i found that they have an almost maniacal fear of this particular spot .
boyle and i are saying nothing to others , for you very obviously ought to have precedence in any discoveries or credit .
the place can be reached from pilbarra in about four days by motor tractor which we need for our apparatus .
it is somewhat west and south of warburton path of , and miles southeast of joanna spring .
we could float things up the de grey river instead of starting from pilbarra but all that can be talked over later .
roughly the stones lie at a point about ' south latitude , ' east longitude .
the climate is tropical , and the desert conditions are trying .
i shall welcome further correspondence upon this subject , and am keenly eager to assist in any plan you may devise .
after studying your articles i am deeply impressed with the profound significance of the whole matter .
boyle will write later .
when rapid communication is needed , a cable to perth can be relayed by wireless .
hoping profoundly for an early message , believe me , most faithfully yours , robert mackenzie of the immediate aftermath of this letter , much can be learned from the press .
my good fortune in securing the backing of miskatonic university was great , and both mackenzie and boyle proved invaluable in arranging matters at the australian end .
we were not too specific with the public about our objects , since the whole matter would have lent itself unpleasantly to sensational and jocose treatment by the cheaper newspapers .
as a result , printed reports were sparing ; but enough appeared to tell of our quest for reported australian ruins and to chronicle our various preparatory steps .
professor william dyer of the college geology department leader of the miskatonic antarctic expedition of ferdinand ashley of the department of ancient history , and tyler freeborn of the department of anthropology together with my son wingate accompanied me .
my correspondent , mackenzie , came to arkham early in and assisted in our final preparations .
he proved to be a tremendously competent and affable man of about fifty , admirably , and deeply familiar with all the conditions of australian travel .
he had tractors waiting at pilbarra , and we chartered a tramp steamer sufficiently small to get up the river to that point .
we were prepared to excavate in the most careful and scientific fashion , sifting every particle of sand , and disturbing nothing which might seem to be in or near its original situation .
sailing from boston aboard the wheezy lexington on march , , we had a leisurely trip across the atlantic and mediterranean , through the suez canal , down the red sea , and across the indian ocean to our goal .
i need not tell how the sight of the low , sandy west australian coast depressed me , and how i detested the crude mining town and dreary gold fields where the tractors were given their last loads .
boyle , who met us , proved to be elderly , pleasant , and intelligent and his knowledge of psychology led him into many long discussions with my son and me .
discomfort and expectancy were oddly mingled in most of us when at length our party of eighteen rattled forth over the arid leagues of sand and rock .
on friday , may , we forded a branch of the de grey and entered the realm of utter desolation .
a certain positive terror grew on me as we advanced to this actual site of the elder world behind the legends a terror , of course , abetted by the fact that my disturbing dreams and still beset me with unabated force .
it was on monday , june , that we saw the first of the blocks .
i can not describe the emotions with which i actually touched in objective reality a fragment of cyclopean masonry in every respect like the blocks in the walls of my .
there was a distinct trace of carving and my hands trembled as i recognised part of a curvilinear decorative scheme made hellish to me through years of tormenting nightmare and baffling research .
a month of digging brought a total of some blocks in varying stages of wear and disintegration .
most of these were carven megaliths with curved tops and bottoms .
a minority were smaller , flatter , , and square or octagonally those of the floors and pavements in my dreams while a few were singularly massive and curved or slanted in such a manner as to suggest use in vaulting or groining , or as parts of arches or round window casings .
the deeper and the farther north and east we dug , the more blocks we found ; though we still failed to discover any trace of arrangement among them .
professor dyer was appalled at the measureless age of the fragments , and freeborn found traces of symbols which fitted darkly into certain papuan and polynesian legends of infinite antiquity .
the condition and scattering of the blocks told mutely of vertiginous cycles of time and geologic upheavals of cosmic savagery .
we had an aëroplane with us , and my son wingate would often go up to different heights and scan the waste for signs of dim , outlines either differences of level or trails of scattered blocks .
his results were virtually negative ; for whenever he would one day think he had glimpsed some significant trend , he would on his next trip find the impression replaced by another equally insubstantial a result of the shifting , sand .
one or two of these ephemeral suggestions , though , affected me queerly and disagreeably .
they seemed , after a fashion , to dovetail horribly with something i had dreamed or read , but which i could no longer remember .
there was a terrible familiarity about them which somehow made me look furtively and apprehensively over the abominable , sterile terrain toward the north and northeast .
around the first week in july i developed an unaccountable set of mixed emotions about that general northeasterly region .
there was horror , and there was curiosity but more than that , there was a persistent and perplexing illusion of memory .
i tried all sorts of psychological expedients to get these notions out of my head , but met with no success .
sleeplessness also gained upon me , but i almost welcomed this because of the resultant shortening of my .
i acquired the habit of taking long , lone walks in the desert late at night usually to the north or northeast , whither the sum of my strange new impulses seemed subtly to pull me .
sometimes , on these walks , i would stumble over nearly buried fragments of the ancient masonry .
though there were fewer visible blocks here than where we had started , i felt sure that there must be a vast abundance beneath the surface .
the ground was less level than at our camp , and the prevailing high winds now and then piled the sand into fantastic temporary hillocks exposing low traces of the elder stones while it covered other traces .
i was queerly anxious to have the excavations extend to this territory , yet at the same time dreaded what might be revealed .
obviously , i was getting into a rather bad state all the worse because i could not account for it .
an indication of my poor nervous health can be gained from my response to an odd discovery which i made on one of my nocturnal rambles .
it was on the evening of july , when the moon flooded the mysterious hillocks with a curious pallor .
wandering somewhat beyond my usual limits , i came upon a great stone which seemed to differ markedly from any we had yet encountered .
it was almost wholly covered , but i stooped and cleared away the sand with my hands , later studying the object carefully and supplementing the moonlight with my electric torch .
unlike the other very large rocks , this one was perfectly , with no convex or concave surface .
it seemed , too , to be of a dark basaltic substance , wholly dissimilar to the granite and sandstone and occasional concrete of the now familiar fragments .
suddenly i rose , turned , and ran for the camp at top speed .
it was a wholly unconscious and irrational flight , and only when i was close to my tent did i fully realise why i had run .
then it came to me .
the queer dark stone was something which i had dreamed and read about , and which was linked with the uttermost horrors of the legendry .
it was one of the blocks of that basaltic elder masonry which the fabled great race held in such fear the tall , windowless ruins left by those brooding , , alien things that festered in earth nether abysses and against whose , invisible forces the were sealed and the sleepless sentinels posted .
i remained awake all night , but by dawn realised how silly i had been to let the shadow of a myth upset me .
instead of being frightened , i should have had a discoverer enthusiasm .
the next forenoon i told the others about my find , and dyer , freeborn , boyle , my son , and i set out to view the anomalous block .
failure , however , confronted us .
i had formed no clear idea of the stone location , and a late wind had wholly altered the hillocks of shifting sand .
i come now to the crucial and most difficult part of my narrative all the more difficult because i can not be quite certain of its reality .
at times i feel uncomfortably sure that i was not dreaming or deluded ; and it is this feeling in view of the stupendous implications which the objective truth of my experience would raise which impels me to make this record .
my son a trained psychologist with the fullest and most sympathetic knowledge of my whole case shall be the primary judge of what i have to tell .
first let me outline the externals of the matter , as those at the camp know them .
on the night of july , after a windy day , i retired early but could not sleep .
rising shortly before eleven , and afflicted as usual with that strange feeling regarding the northeastward terrain , i set out on one of my typical nocturnal walks ; seeing and greeting only one person an australian miner named tupper as i left our precincts .
the moon , slightly past full , shone from a clear sky , and drenched the ancient sands with a white , leprous radiance which seemed to me somehow infinitely evil .
there was no longer any wind , nor did any return for nearly five hours , as amply attested by tupper and others who saw me walking rapidly across the pallid , hillocks toward the northeast .
about a violent wind blew up , waking everyone in camp and felling three of the tents .
the sky was unclouded , and the desert still blazed with that leprous moonlight .
as the party saw to the tents my absence was noted , but in view of my previous walks this circumstance gave no one alarm .
and yet , as many as three men all australians seemed to feel something sinister in the air .
mackenzie explained to professor freeborn that this was a fear picked up from blackfellow folklore the natives having woven a curious fabric of malignant myth about the high winds which at long intervals sweep across the sands under a clear sky .
such winds , it is whispered , blow out of the great stone huts under the ground , where terrible things have happened and are never felt except near places where the big marked stones are scattered .
close to four the gale subsided as suddenly as it had begun , leaving the sand hills in new and unfamiliar shapes .
it was just past five , with the bloated , fungoid moon sinking in the west , when i staggered into camp hatless , tattered , features scratched and ensanguined , and without my electric torch .
most of the men had returned to bed , but professor dyer was smoking a pipe in front of his tent .
seeing my winded and almost frenzied state , he called boyle , and the two of them got me on my cot and made me comfortable .
my son , roused by the stir , soon joined them , and they all tried to force me to lie still and attempt sleep .
but there was no sleep for me .
my psychological state was very extraordinary different from anything i had previously suffered .
after a time i insisted upon talking nervously and elaborately explaining my condition .
i told them i had become fatigued , and had lain down in the sand for a nap .
there had , i said , been dreams even more frightful than usual and when i was awaked by the sudden high wind my overwrought nerves had snapped .
i had fled in panic , frequently falling over stones and thus gaining my tattered and bedraggled aspect .
i must have slept long hence the hours of my absence .
of anything strange either seen or experienced i hinted absolutely nothing exercising the greatest in that respect .
but i spoke of a change of mind regarding the whole work of the expedition , and urged a halt in all digging toward the northeast .
my reasoning was patently weak for i mentioned a dearth of blocks , a wish not to offend the superstitious miners , a possible shortage of funds from the college , and other things either untrue or irrelevant .
naturally , no one paid the least attention to my new wishes not even my son , whose concern for my health was obvious .
the next day i was up and around the camp , but took no part in the excavations .
seeing that i could not stop the work , i decided to return home as soon as possible for the sake of my nerves , and made my son promise to fly me in the plane to perth a thousand miles to the southwest as soon as he had surveyed the region i wished let alone .
if , i reflected , the thing i had seen was still visible , i might decide to attempt a specific warning even at the cost of ridicule .
it was just conceivable that the miners who knew the local folklore might back me up .
humouring me , my son made the survey that very afternoon , flying over all the terrain my walk could possibly have covered .
yet nothing of what i had found remained in sight .
it was the case of the anomalous basalt block all over again the shifting sand had wiped out every trace .
for an instant i half regretted having lost a certain awesome object in my stark fright but now i know that the loss was merciful .
i can still believe my whole experience an illusion especially if , as i devoutly hope , that hellish abyss is never found .
wingate took me to perth on july , though declining to abandon the expedition and return home .
he stayed with me until the , when the steamer for liverpool sailed .
now , in the cabin of the empress , i am pondering long and frantically upon the entire matter , and have decided that my son at least must be informed .
it shall rest with him whether to diffuse the matter more widely .
in order to meet any eventuality i have prepared this summary of my background as already known in a scattered way to others and will now tell as briefly as possible what seemed to happen during my absence from the camp that hideous night .
nerves on edge , and whipped into a kind of perverse eagerness by that inexplicable , , mnemonic urge toward the northeast , i plodded on beneath the evil , burning moon .
here and there i saw , half shrouded by sand , those primal cyclopean blocks left from nameless and forgotten aeons .
the incalculable age and brooding horror of this monstrous waste began to oppress me as never before , and i could not keep from thinking of my maddening dreams , of the frightful legends which lay behind them , and of the present fears of natives and miners concerning the desert and its carven stones .
and yet i plodded on as if to some eldritch rendezvous more and more assailed by bewildering fancies , compulsions , and .
i thought of some of the possible contours of the lines of stones as seen by my son from the air , and wondered why they seemed at once so ominous and so familiar .
something was fumbling and rattling at the latch of my recollection , while another unknown force sought to keep the portal barred .
the night was windless , and the pallid sand curved upward and downward like frozen waves of the sea .
i had no goal , but somehow ploughed along as if with assurance .
my dreams welled up into the waking world , so that each megalith seemed part of endless rooms and corridors of masonry , carved and hieroglyphed with symbols that i knew too well from years of custom as a captive mind of the great race .
at moments i fancied i saw those omniscient , conical horrors moving about at their accustomed tasks , and i feared to look down lest i find myself one with them in aspect .
yet all the while i saw the blocks as well as the rooms and corridors ; the evil , burning moon as well as the lamps of luminous crystal ; the endless desert as well as the waving ferns beyond the windows .
i was awake and dreaming at the same time .
i do not know how long or how far or indeed , in just what direction i had walked when i first spied the heap of blocks bared by the day wind .
it was the largest group in one place that i had seen so far , and so sharply did it impress me that the visions of fabulous aeons faded suddenly away .
again there were only the desert and the evil moon and the shards of an unguessed past .
i drew close and paused , and cast the added light of my electric torch over the tumbled pile .
a hillock had blown away , leaving a low , irregularly round mass of megaliths and smaller fragments some forty feet across and from two to eight feet high .
from the very outset i realized that there was some utterly unprecedented quality about those stones .
not only was the mere number of them quite without parallel , but something in the sandworn traces of design arrested me as i scanned them under the mingled beams of the moon and my torch .
not that any one differed essentially from the earlier specimens we had found .
it was something subtler than that .
the impression did not come when i looked at one block alone , but only when i ran my eye over several almost simultaneously .
then , at last , the truth dawned upon me .
the curvilinear patterns on many of those blocks were closely related parts of one vast decorative conception .
for the first time in this waste i had come upon a mass of masonry in its old position tumbled and fragmentary , it is true , but none the less existing in a very definite sense .
mounting at a low place , i clambered laboriously over the heap ; here and there clearing away the sand with my fingers , and constantly striving to interpret varieties of size , shape , and style , and relationships of design .
after a while i could vaguely guess at the nature of the bygone structure , and at the designs which had once stretched over the vast surfaces of the primal masonry .
the perfect identity of the whole with some of my appalled and unnerved me .
this was once a cyclopean corridor thirty feet tall , paved with octagonal blocks and solidly vaulted overhead .
there would have been rooms opening off on the right , and at the farther end one of those strange inclined planes would have wound down to still lower depths .
i started violently as these conceptions occurred to me , for there was more in them than the blocks themselves had supplied .
how did i know that this level should have been far underground ?
how did i know that the plane leading upward should have been behind me ?
how did i know that the long subterrene passage to the square of pillars ought to lie on the left one level above me ?
how did i know that the room of machines and the tunnel to the central archives ought to lie two levels below ?
how did i know that there would be one of those horrible , at the very bottom four levels down ?
bewildered by this intrusion from the , i found myself shaking and bathed in a cold perspiration .
then , as a last , intolerable touch , i felt that faint , insidious stream of cool air trickling upward from a depressed place near the center of the huge heap .
instantly , as once before , my visions faded , and i saw again only the evil moonlight , the brooding desert , and the spreading tumulus of palaeogean masonry .
something real and tangible , yet fraught with infinite suggestions of nighted mystery , now confronted me .
for that stream of air could argue but one thing a hidden gulf of great size beneath the disordered blocks on the surface .
my first thought was of the sinister blackfellow legends of vast underground huts among the megaliths where horrors happen and great winds are born .
then thoughts of my own dreams came back , and i felt dim tugging at my mind .
what manner of place lay below me ?
what primal , inconceivable source of and haunting nightmares might i be on the brink of uncovering ?
it was only for a moment that i hesitated , for more than curiosity and scientific zeal was driving me on and working against my growing fear .
i seemed to move almost automatically , as if in the clutch of some compelling fate .
pocketing my torch , and struggling with a strength that i had not thought i possessed , i wrenched aside first one titan fragment of stone and then another , till there welled up a strong draught whose dampness contrasted oddly with the desert dry air .
a black rift began to yawn , and at length when i had pushed away every fragment small enough to budge the leprous moonlight blazed on an aperture of ample width to admit me .
i drew out my torch and cast a brilliant beam into the opening .
below me was a chaos of tumbled masonry , sloping roughly down toward the north at an angle of about degrees , and evidently the result of some bygone collapse from above .
between its surface and the ground level was a gulf of impenetrable blackness at whose upper edge were signs of gigantic , vaulting .
at this point , it appeared , the deserts sands lay directly upon a floor of some titan structure of earth youth how preserved through aeons of geologic convulsion i could not then and can not now even attempt to guess .
in retrospect , the barest idea of a sudden , lone descent into such a doubtful abyss and at a time when one whereabouts were unknown to any living soul seems like the utter apex of insanity .
perhaps it was yet that night i embarked without hesitancy upon such a descent .
again there was manifest that lure and driving of fatality which had all along seemed to direct my course .
with torch flashing intermittently to save the battery , i commenced a mad scramble down the sinister , cyclopean incline below the opening sometimes facing forward as i found good and , and at other times turning to face the heap of megaliths as i clung and fumbled more precariously .
in two directions beside me distant walls of carven , crumbling masonry loomed dimly under the direct beams of my torch .
ahead , however , was only unbroken darkness .
i kept no track of time during my downward scramble .
so seething with baffling hints and images was my mind that all objective matters seemed withdrawn into incalculable distances .
physical sensation was dead , and even fear remained as a , inactive gargoyle leering impotently at me .
eventually , i reached a level floor strewn with fallen blocks , shapeless fragments of stone , and sand and detritus of every kind .
on either side perhaps thirty feet apart rose massive walls culminating in huge groinings .
that they were carved i could just discern , but the nature of the carvings was beyond my perception .
what held me the most was the vaulting overhead .
the beam from my torch could not reach the roof , but the lower parts of the monstrous arches stood out distinctly .
and so perfect was their identity with what i had seen in countless dreams of the elder world , that i trembled actively for the first time .
behind and high above , a faint luminous blur told of the distant moonlit world outside .
some vague shred of caution warned me that i should not let it out of my sight , lest i have no guide for my return .
i now advanced toward the wall at my left , where the traces of carving were plainest .
the littered floor was nearly as hard to traverse as the downward heap had been , but i managed to pick my difficult way .
at one place i heaved aside some blocks and locked away the detritus to see what the pavement was like , and shuddered at the utter , fateful familiarity of the great octagonal stones whose buckled surface still held roughly together .
reaching a convenient distance from the wall , i cast the searchlight slowly and carefully over its worn remnants of carving .
some bygone influx of water seemed to have acted on the sandstone surface , while there were curious incrustations which i could not explain .
in places the masonry was very loose and distorted , and i wondered how many aeons more this primal , hidden edifice could keep its remaining traces of form amidst earth heavings .
but it was the carvings themselves that excited me most .
despite their state , they were relatively easy to trace at close range ; and the complete , intimate familiarity of every detail almost stunned my imagination .
that the major attributes of this hoary masonry should be familiar , was not beyond normal credibility .
powerfully impressing the weavers of certain myths , they had become embodied in a stream of cryptic lore which , somehow , coming to my notice during the amnesic period , had evoked vivid images in my subconscious mind .
but how could i explain the exact and minute fashion in which each line and spiral of these strange designs tallied with what i had dreamed for more than a score of years ?
what obscure , forgotten iconography could have reproduced each subtle shading and nuance which so persistently , exactly , and unvaryingly besieged my sleeping vision night after night ?
for this was no chance or remote resemblance .
definitely and absolutely , the millennially ancient , corridor in which i stood was the original of something i knew in sleep as intimately as i knew my own house in crane street , arkham .
true , my dreams shewed the place in its undecayed prime ; but the identity was no less real on that account .
i was wholly and horribly oriented .
the particular structure i was in was known to me .
known , too , was its place in that terrible elder city of dreams .
that i could visit unerringly any point in that structure or in that city which had escaped the changes and devastations of uncounted ages , i realized with hideous and instinctive certainty .
what in heaven name could all this mean ?
how had i come to know what i knew ?
and what awful reality could lie behind those antique tales of the beings who had dwelt in this labyrinth of primordial stone ?
words can convey only fractionally the welter of dread and bewilderment which ate at my spirit .
i knew this place .
i knew what lay before me , and what had lain overhead before the myriad towering stories had fallen to dust and debris and the desert .
no need now , i thought with a shudder , to keep that faint blur of moonlight in view .
i was torn betwixt a longing to flee and a feverish mixture of burning curiosity and driving fatality .
what had happened to this monstrous megalopolis of old in the millions of years since the time of my dreams ?
of the subterrene mazes which had underlain the city and linked all the titan towers , how much had still survived the writhings of earth crust ?
had i come upon a whole buried world of unholy archaism ?
could i still find the house of the writing master , and the tower where , the captive mind from the vegetable carnivores of antarctica , had chiselled certain pictures on the blank spaces of the walls ?
would the passage at the second level down , to the hall of the alien minds , be still unchoked and traversable ?
in that hall the captive mind of an incredible entity a denizen of the hollow interior of an unknown planet eighteen million years in the future had kept a certain thing which it had modelled from clay .
i shut my eyes and put my hand to my head in a vain , pitiful effort to drive these insane from my consciousness .
then , for the first time , i felt acutely the coolness , motion , and dampness of the surrounding air .
shuddering , i realized that a vast chain of black gulfs must indeed be yawning somewhere beyond and below me .
i thought of the frightful chambers and corridors and inclines as i recalled them from my dreams .
would the way to the central archives still be open ?
again that driving fatality tugged insistently at my brain as i recalled the awesome records that once lay cased in those rectangular vaults of rustless metal .
there , said the dreams and legends , had reposed the whole history , past and future , of the cosmic continuum written by captive minds from every orb and every age in the solar system .
madness , of course but had i not now stumbled into a nighted world as mad as i ?
i thought of the locked metal shelves , and of the curious knob twistings needed to open each one .
my own came vividly into my consciousness .
how often had i gone through that intricate routine of varied turns and pressures in the terrestrial vertebrate section on the lowest level !
every detail was fresh and familiar .
if there were such a vault as i had dreamed of , i could open it in a moment .
it was then that madness took me utterly .
an instant later , and i was leaping and stumbling over the rocky debris toward the incline to the depths below .
from that point forward my impressions are scarcely to be relied on indeed , i still possess a final , desperate hope that they all form parts of some daemonic dream or illusion born of delirium .
a fever raged in my brain , and everything came to me through a kind of haze sometimes only intermittently .
the rays of my torch shot feebly into the engulfing blackness , bringing phantasmal flashes of hideously familiar walls and carvings , all blighted with the decay of ages .
in one place a tremendous mass of vaulting had fallen , so that i had to clamber over a mighty mound of stones reaching almost to the ragged , grotesquely stalactited roof .
it was all the ultimate apex of nightmare , made worse by the blasphemous tug of .
one thing only was unfamiliar , and that was my own size in relation to the monstrous masonry .
i felt oppressed by a sense of unwonted smallness , as if the sight of these towering walls from a mere human body was something wholly new and abnormal .
again and again i looked nervously down at myself , vaguely disturbed by the human form i possessed .
onward through the blackness of the abyss i leaped , plunged , and staggered often falling and bruising myself , and once nearly shattering my torch .
every stone and corner of that daemonic gulf was known to me , and at many points i stopped to cast beams of light through choked and crumbling , yet familiar , archways .
some rooms had totally collapsed ; others were bare , or .
in a few i saw masses of metal some fairly intact , some broken , and some crushed or battered which i recognised as the colossal pedestals or tables of my dreams .
what they could in truth have been , i dared not guess .
i found the downward incline and began its descent though after a time halted by a gaping , ragged chasm whose narrowest point could not be much less than four feet across .
here the stonework had fallen through , revealing incalculable inky depths beneath .
i knew there were two more cellar levels in this titan edifice , and trembled with fresh panic as i recalled the on the lowest one .
there could be no guards now for what had lurked beneath had long since done its hideous work and sunk into its long decline .
by the time of the posthuman beetle race it would be quite dead .
and yet , as i thought of the native legends , i trembled anew .
it cost me a terrible effort to vault that yawning chasm , since the littered floor prevented a running start but madness drove me on .
i chose a place close to the wall where the rift was least wide and the reasonably clear of dangerous debris and after one frantic moment reached the other side in safety .
at last , gaining the lower level , i stumbled on past the archway of the room of machines , within which were fantastic ruins of metal , half buried beneath fallen vaulting .
everything was where i knew it would be , and i climbed confidently over the heaps which barred the entrance of a vast transverse corridor .
this , i realised , would take me under the city to the central archives .
endless ages seemed to unroll as i stumbled , leaped , and crawled along that corridor .
now and then i could make out carvings on the walls some familiar , others seemingly added since the period of my dreams .
since this was a subterrene highway , there were no archways save when the route led through the lower levels of various buildings .
at some of these intersections i turned aside long enough to look down corridors and into rooms .
twice only did i find any radical changes from what i had dreamed of and in one of these cases i could trace the outlines of the archway i remembered .
i shook violently , and felt a curious surge of retarding weakness , as i steered a hurried and reluctant course through the crypt of one of those great windowless , ruined towers whose alien , basalt masonry bespoke a whispered and horrible origin .
this primal vault was round and fully two hundred feet across , with nothing carved upon the stonework .
the floor was here free from anything save dust and sand , and i could see the apertures leading upward and downward .
there were no stairs or inclines indeed , my dreams had pictured those elder towers as wholly untouched by the fabulous great race .
those who had built them had not needed stairs or inclines .
in the dreams , the downward aperture had been tightly sealed and nervously guarded .
now it lay and yawning , and giving forth a current of cool , damp air .
of what limitless caverns of eternal night might brood below , i would not permit myself to think .
later , clawing my way along a badly heaped section of the corridor , i reached a place where the roof had wholly caved in .
the debris rose like a mountain , and i climbed up over it , passing through a vast , empty space where my torchlight could reveal neither walls nor vaulting .
this , i reflected , must be the cellar of the house of the , fronting on the third square not far from the archives .
what had happened to it i could not conjecture .
i found the corridor again beyond the mountain of detritus and stone , but after a short distance encountered a wholly choked place where the fallen vaulting almost touched the perilously sagging ceiling .
how i managed to wrench and tear aside enough blocks to afford a passage , and how i dared disturb the tightly packed fragments when the least shift of equilibrium might have brought down all the tons of superincumbent masonry to crush me to nothingness , i do not know .
it was sheer madness that impelled and guided me if , indeed , my whole underground adventure was not as i hope a hellish delusion or phase of dreaming .
but i did make or dream that i made a passage that i could squirm through .
as i wiggled over the mound of debris my torch , switched continuously on , thrust deeply in my mouth i felt myself torn by the fantastic stalactites of the jagged floor above me .
i was now close to the great underground archival structure which seemed to form my goal .
sliding and clambering down the farther side of the barrier , and picking my way along the remaining stretch of corridor with , intermittently flashing torch , i came at last to a low , circular crypt with arches still in a marvelous state of preservation opening off on every side .
the walls , or such parts of them as lay within reach of my torchlight , were densely hieroglyphed and chiselled with typical curvilinear symbols some added since the period of my dreams .
this , i realised , was my fated destination , and i turned at once through a familiar archway on my left .
that i could find a clear passage up and down the incline to all the surviving levels , i had , oddly , little doubt .
this vast , pile , housing the annals of all the solar system , had been built with supernal skill and strength to last as long as that system itself .
blocks of stupendous size , poised with mathematical genius and bound with cements of incredible toughness , had combined to form a mass as firm as the planet rocky core .
here , after ages more prodigious than i could sanely grasp , its buried bulk stood in all its essential contours , the vast , floors scarce sprinkled with the litter elsewhere so dominant .
the relatively easy walking from this point onward went curiously to my head .
all the frantic eagerness hitherto frustrated by obstacles now took itself out in a kind of febrile speed , and i literally raced along the , monstrously aisles beyond the archway .
i was past being astonished by the familiarity of what i saw .
on every hand the great hieroglyphed metal loomed monstrously ; some yet in place , others sprung open , and still others bent and buckled under bygone geological stresses not quite strong enough to shatter the titan masonry .
here and there a heap beneath a gaping , empty shelf seemed to indicate where cases had been shaken down by earth tremors .
on occasional pillars were great symbols or letters proclaiming classes and subclasses of volumes .
once i paused before an open vault where i saw some of the accustomed metal cases still in position amidst the omnipresent gritty dust .
reaching up , i dislodged one of the thinner specimens with some difficulty , and rested it on the floor for inspection .
it was titled in the prevailing curvilinear hieroglyphs , though something in the arrangement of the characters seemed subtly unusual .
the odd mechanism of the hooked fastener was perfectly well known to me , and i snapped up the still rustless and workable lid and drew out the book within .
the latter , as expected , was some twenty by fifteen inches in area , and two inches thick ; the thin metal covers opening at the top .
its tough cellulose pages seemed unaffected by the myriad cycles of time they had lived through , and i studied the queerly pigmented , letters of the unlike either the usual curved hieroglyphs or any alphabet known to human scholarship with a haunting , memory .
it came to me that this was the language used by a captive mind i had known slightly in my dreams a mind from a large asteroid on which had survived much of the archaic life and lore of the primal planet whereof it formed a fragment .
at the same time i recalled that this level of the archives was devoted to volumes dealing with the planets .
as i ceased poring over this incredible document i saw that the light of my torch was beginning to fail , hence quickly inserted the extra battery i always had with me .
then , armed with the stronger radiance , i resumed my feverish racing through unending tangles of aisles and corridors recognising now and then some familiar shelf , and vaguely annoyed by the acoustic conditions which made my footfalls echo incongruously in these catacombs .
the very prints of my shoes behind me in the millennially untrodden dust made me shudder .
never before , if my mad dreams held anything of truth , had human feet pressed upon those immemorial pavements .
of the particular goal of my insane racing , my conscious mind held no hint .
there was , however , some force of evil potency pulling at my dazed will and buried recollection , so that i vaguely felt i was not running at random .
i came to a downward incline and followed it to profounder depths .
floors flashed by me as i raced , but i did not pause to explore them .
in my whirling brain there had begun to beat a certain rhythm which set my right hand twitching in unison .
i wanted to unlock something , and felt that i knew all the intricate twists and pressures needed to do it .
it would be like a modern safe with a combination lock .
dream or not , i had once known and still knew .
how any dream or scrap of unconsciously absorbed legend could have taught me a detail so minute , so intricate , and so complex , i did not attempt to explain to myself .
i was beyond all coherent thought .
for was not this whole experience this shocking familiarity with a set of unknown ruins , and this monstrously exact identity of everything before me with what only dreams and scraps of myth could have suggested a horror beyond all reason ?
probably it was my basic conviction then as it is now during my saner moments that i was not awake at all , and that the entire buried city was a fragment of febrile hallucination .
eventually , i reached the lowest level and struck off to the right of the incline .
for some shadowy reason i tried to soften my steps , even though i lost speed thereby .
there was a space i was afraid to cross on this last , deeply buried floor .
as i drew near it i recalled what thing in that space i feared .
it was merely one of the and closely guarded .
there would be no guards now , and on that account i trembled and tiptoed as i had done in passing through that black basalt vault where a similar had yawned .
i felt a current of cool , damp air as i had felt there , and wished that my course led in another direction .
why i had to take the particular course i was taking , i did not know .
when i came to the space i saw that the yawned widely open .
ahead , the shelves began again , and i glimpsed on the floor before one of them a heap very thinly covered with dust , where a number of cases had recently fallen .
at the same moment a fresh wave of panic clutched me , though for some time i could not discover why .
heaps of fallen cases were not uncommon , for all through the aeons this lightless labyrinth had been racked by the heavings of earth and had echoed at intervals of the deafening clatter of toppling objects .
it was only when i was nearly across the space that i realized why i shook so violently .
not the heap , but something about the dust of the level floor was troubling me .
in the light of my torch it seemed as if that dust were not as even as it ought to be there were places where it looked thinner , as if it had been disturbed not many months before .
i could not be sure , for even the apparently thinner places were dusty enough ; yet a certain suspicion of regularity in the fancied unevenness was highly disquieting .
when i brought the torchlight close to one of the queer places i did not like what i saw for the illusion of regularity became very great .
it was as if there were regular lines of composite impressions impressions that went in threes , each slightly over a foot square , and consisting of five nearly circular prints , one in advance of the other four .
these possible lines of impressions appeared to lead in two directions , as if something had gone somewhere and returned .
they were , of course , very faint , and may have been illusions or accidents ; but there was an element of dim , fumbling terror about the way i thought they ran .
for at one end of them was the heap of cases which must have clattered down not long before , while at the other end was the ominous with the cool , damp wind , yawning unguarded down to abysses past imagination .
that my strange sense of compulsion was deep and overwhelming is shewn by its conquest of my fear .
no rational motive could have drawn me on after that hideous suspicion of prints and the creeping it excited .
yet my right hand , even as it shook with fright , still twitched rhythmically in its eagerness to turn a lock it hoped to find .
before i knew it i was past the heap of lately fallen cases and running on tiptoe through aisles of utterly unbroken dust toward a point which i seemed to know morbidly , horribly well .
my mind was asking itself questions whose origin and relevancy i was only beginning to guess .
would the shelf be reachable by a human body ?
could my human hand master all the motions of the lock ?
would the lock be undamaged and workable ?
and what would i do what dare i do with what as i now commenced to realise i both hoped and feared to find ?
would it prove the awesome , truth of something past normal conception , or shew only that i was dreaming ?
the next i knew i had ceased my tiptoed racing and was standing still , staring at a row of maddeningly familiar hieroglyphed shelves .
they were in a state of almost perfect preservation , and only three of the doors in this vicinity had sprung open .
my feelings toward these shelves can not be described so utter and insistent was the sense of old acquaintance .
i was looking high up at a row near the top and wholly out of my reach , and wondering how i could climb to best advantage .
an open door four rows from the bottom would help , and the locks of the closed doors formed possible holds for hands and feet .
i would grip the torch between my teeth , as i had in other places where both hands were needed .
above all i must make no noise .
how to get down what i wished to remove would be difficult , but i could probably hook its movable fastener in my coat collar and carry it like a knapsack .
again i wondered whether the lock would be undamaged .
that i could repeat each familiar motion i had not the least doubt .
but i hoped the thing would not scrape or creak and that my hand could work it properly .
even as i thought these things i had taken the torch in my mouth and begun to climb .
the projecting locks were poor supports ; but , as i had expected , the opened shelf helped greatly .
i used both the swinging door and the edge of the aperture itself in my ascent , and managed to avoid any loud creaking .
balanced on the upper edge of the door , and leaning far to my right , i could just reach the lock i sought .
my fingers , half numb from climbing , were very clumsy at first ; but i soon saw that they were anatomically adequate .
and the was strong in them .
out of unknown gulfs of time the intricate , secret motions had somehow reached my brain correctly in every detail for after less than five minutes of trying there came a click whose familiarity was all the more startling because i had not consciously anticipated it .
in another instant the metal door was slowly swinging open with only the faintest grating sound .
dazedly i looked over the row of greyish case ends thus exposed , and felt a tremendous surge of some wholly inexplicable emotion .
just within reach of my right hand was a case whose curving hieroglyphs made me shake with a pang infinitely more complex than one of mere fright .
still shaking , i managed to dislodge it amidst a shower of gritty flakes , and ease it over toward myself without any violent noise .
like the other case i had handled , it was slightly more than twenty by fifteen inches in size , with curved mathematical designs in low relief .
in thickness it just exceeded three inches .
crudely wedging it between myself and the surface i was climbing , i fumbled with the fastener and finally got the hook free .
lifting the cover , i shifted the heavy object to my back , and let the hook catch hold of my collar .
hands now free , i awkwardly clambered down to the dusty floor , and prepared to inspect my prize .
kneeling in the gritty dust , i swung the case around and rested it in front of me .
my hands shook , and i dreaded to draw out the book within almost as much as i longed and felt compelled to do so .
it had very gradually become clear to me what i ought to find , and this realisation nearly paralysed my faculties .
if the thing were there and if i were not dreaming the implications would be quite beyond the power of the human spirit to bear .
what tormented me most was my momentary inability to feel that my surroundings were a dream .
the sense of reality was hideous and again becomes so as i recall the scene .
at length i tremblingly pulled the book from its container and stared fascinatedly at the hieroglyphs on the cover .
it seemed to be in prime condition , and the curvilinear letters of the title held me in almost as hypnotised a state as if i could read them .
indeed , i can not swear that i did not actually read them in some transient and terrible access of abnormal memory .
i do not know how long it was before i dared to lift that thin metal cover .
i temporized and made excuses to myself .
i took the torch from my mouth and shut it off to save the battery .
then , in the dark , i collected my courage finally lifting the cover without turning on the light .
last of all , i did indeed flash the torch upon the exposed page steeling myself in advance to suppress any sound no matter what i should find .
i looked for an instant , then collapsed .
clenching my teeth , however , i kept silent .
i sank wholly to the floor and put a hand to my forehead amidst the engulfing blackness .
what i dreaded and expected was there .
either i was dreaming , or time and space had become a mockery .
i must be dreaming but i would test the horror by carrying this thing back and shewing it to my son if it were indeed a reality .
my head swam frightfully , even though there were no visible objects in the unbroken gloom to swirl about me .
ideas and images of the starkest terror excited by vistas which my glimpse had opened up began to throng in upon me and cloud my senses .
i thought of those possible prints in the dust , and trembled at the sound of my own breathing as i did so .
once again i flashed on the light and looked at the page as a serpent victim may look at his destroyer eyes and fangs .
then , with clumsy fingers , in the dark , i closed the book , put it in its container , and snapped the lid and the curious , hooked fastener .
this was what i must carry back to the outer world if it truly existed if the whole abyss truly existed if i , and the world itself , truly existed .
just when i tottered to my feet and commenced my return i can not be certain .
it comes to me oddly as a measure of my sense of separation from the normal world that i did not even once look at my watch during those hideous hours underground .
torch in hand , and with the ominous case under one arm , i eventually found myself tiptoeing in a kind of silent panic past the abyss and those lurking suggestions of prints .
i lessened my precautions as i climbed up the endless inclines , but could not shake off a shadow of apprehension which i had not felt on the downward journey .
i dreaded having to repass through the black basalt crypt that was older than the city itself , where cold draughts welled up from unguarded depths .
i thought of that which the great race had feared , and of what might still be lurking be it ever so weak and dying down there .
i thought of those prints and of what my dreams had told me of such prints and of strange winds and whistling noises associated with them .
and i thought of the tales of the modern blackfellows , wherein the horror of great winds and nameless subterrene ruins was dwelt upon .
i knew from a carven wall symbol the right floor to enter , and came at last after passing that other book i had examined to the great circular space with the branching archways .
on my right , and at once recognisable , was the arch through which i had arrived .
this i now entered , conscious that the rest of my course would be harder because of the tumbled state of the masonry outside the archive building .
my new burden weighed upon me , and i found it harder and harder to be quiet as i stumbled among debris and fragments of every sort .
then i came to the mound of debris through which i had wrenched a scanty passage .
my dread at wriggling through again was infinite , for my first passage had made some noise , and i now after seeing those possible prints dreaded sound above all things .
the case , too , doubled the problem of traversing the narrow crevice .
but i clambered up the barrier as best i could , and pushed the case through the aperture ahead of me .
then , torch in mouth , i scrambled through myself my back torn as before by stalactites .
as i tried to grasp the case again , it fell some distance ahead of me down the slope of the debris , making a disturbing clatter and arousing echoes which sent me into a cold perspiration .
i lunged for it at once , and regained it without further noise but a moment afterward the slipping of blocks under my feet raised a sudden and unprecedented din .
the din was my undoing .
for , falsely or not , i thought i heard it answered in a terrible way from spaces far behind me .
i thought i heard a shrill , whistling sound , like nothing else on earth , and beyond any adequate verbal description .
if so , what followed has a grim irony since , save for the panic of this thing , the second thing might never have happened .
as it was , my frenzy was absolute and unrelieved .
taking my torch in my hand and clutching feebly at the case , i leaped and bounded wildly ahead with no idea in my brain beyond a mad desire to race out of these nightmare ruins to the waking world of desert and moonlight which lay so far above .
i hardly knew it when i reached the mountain of debris which towered into the vast blackness beyond the roof , and bruised and cut myself repeatedly in scrambling up its steep slope of jagged blocks and fragments .
then came the great disaster .
just as i blindly crossed the summit , unprepared for the sudden dip ahead , my feet slipped utterly and i found myself involved in a mangling avalanche of sliding masonry whose uproar split the black cavern air in a deafening series of reverberations .
i have no recollection of emerging from this chaos , but a momentary fragment of consciousness shows me as plunging and tripping and scrambling along the corridor amidst the clangour case and torch still with me .
then , just as i approached that primal basalt crypt i had so dreaded , utter madness came .
for as the echoes of the avalanche died down , there became audible a repetition of that frightful alien whistling i thought i had heard before .
this time there was no doubt about it and what was worse , it came from a point not behind but ahead of me .
probably i shrieked aloud then .
i have a dim picture of myself as flying through the hellish basalt vault of the elder things , and hearing that damnable alien sound piping up from the open , unguarded door of limitless nether blacknesses .
there was a wind , too not merely a cool , damp draught , but a violent , purposeful blast belching savagely and frigidly from that abominable gulf whence the obscene whistling came .
there are memories of leaping and lurching over obstacles of every sort , with that torrent of wind and shrieking sound growing moment by moment , and seeming to curl and twist purposefully around me as it struck out wickedly from the spaces behind and beneath .
though in my rear , that wind had the odd effect of hindering instead of aiding my progress ; as if it acted like a noose or lasso thrown around me .
heedless of the noise i made , i clattered over a great barrier of blocks and was again in the structure that led to the surface .
i recall glimpsing the archway to the room of machines and almost crying out as i saw the incline leading down to where one of those blasphemous must be yawning two levels below .
but instead of crying out i muttered over and over to myself that this was all a dream from which i must soon awake .
perhaps i was in camp perhaps i was at home in arkham .
as these hopes bolstered up my sanity i began to mount the incline to the higher level .
i knew , of course , that i had the cleft to , yet was too racked by other fears to realise the full horror until i came almost upon it .
on my descent , the leap across had been easy but could i clear the gap as readily when going uphill , and hampered by fright , exhaustion , the weight of the metal case , and the anomalous backward tug of that daemon wind ?
i thought of these things at the last moment , and thought also of the nameless entities which might be lurking in the black abysses below the chasm .
my wavering torch was growing feeble , but i could tell by some obscure memory when i neared the cleft .
the chill blasts of wind and the nauseous whistling shrieks behind me were for the moment like a merciful opiate , dulling my imagination to the horror of the yawning gulf ahead .
and then i became aware of the added blasts and whistling in front of me tides of abomination surging up through the cleft itself from depths unimagined and unimaginable .
now , indeed , the essence of pure nightmare was upon me .
sanity departed and , ignoring everything except the animal impulse of flight , i merely struggled and plunged upward over the incline debris as if no gulf had existed .
then i saw the chasm edge , leaped frenziedly with every ounce of strength i possessed , and was instantly engulfed in a pandaemoniae vortex of loathsome sound and utter , materially tangible blackness .
this is the end of my experience , so far as i can recall .
any further impressions belong wholly to the domain of phantasmagoria delirium .
dream , madness , and memory merged wildly together in a series of fantastic , fragmentary delusions which can have no relation to anything real .
there was a hideous fall through incalculable leagues of viscous , sentient darkness , and a babel of noises utterly alien to all that we know of the earth and its organic life .
dormant , rudimentary senses seemed to start into vitality within me , telling of pits and voids peopled by floating horrors and leading to sunless crags and oceans and teeming cities of windowless , basalt towers upon which no light ever shone .
secrets of the primal planet and its immemorial aeons flashed through my brain without the aid of sight or sound , and there were known to me things which not even the wildest of my former dreams had ever suggested .
and all the while cold fingers of damp vapor clutched and picked at me , and that eldritch , damnable whistling shrieked fiendishly above all the alternations of babel and silence in the whirlpools of darkness around .
afterward there were visions of the cyclopean city of my dreams not in ruins , but just as i had dreamed of it .
i was in my conical , body again , and mingled with crowds of the great race and the captive minds who carried books up and down the lofty corridors and vast inclines .
then , superimposed upon these pictures , were frightful , momentary flashes of a consciousness involving desperate struggles , a writhing free from clutching tentacles of whistling wind , an insane , flight through air , a feverish burrowing through the dark , and a wild stumbling and scrambling over fallen masonry .
once there was a curious , intrusive flash of half sight a faint , diffuse suspicion of bluish radiance far overhead .
then there came a dream of wind pursued climbing and crawling of wriggling into a blaze of sardonic moonlight through a jumble of debris which slid and collapsed after me amidst a morbid hurricane .
it was the evil , monotonous beating of that maddening moonlight which at last told me of the return of what i had once known as the objective , waking world .
i was clawing prone through the sands of the australian desert , and around me shrieked such a tumult of wind as i had never before known on our planet surface .
my clothing was in rags , and my whole body was a mass of bruises and scratches .
full consciousness returned very slowly , and at no time could i tell just where delirious dream left off and true memory began .
there had seemed to be a mound of titan blocks , an abyss beneath it , a monstrous revelation from the past , and a nightmare horror at the end but how much of this was real ?
my flashlight was gone , and likewise any metal case i may have discovered .
had there been such a case or any abyss or any mound ?
raising my head , i looked behind me , and saw only the sterile , undulant sands of the desert .
the daemon wind died down , and the bloated , fungoid moon sank reddeningly in the west .
i lurched to my feet and began to stagger southwestward toward the camp .
what in truth had happened to me ?
had i merely collapsed in the desert and dragged a body over miles of sand and buried blocks ?
if not , how could i bear to live any longer ?
for , in this new doubt , all my faith in the unreality of my visions dissolved once more into the hellish older doubting .
if that abyss was real , then the great race was real and its blasphemous reachings and seizures in the vortex of time were no myths or nightmares , but a terrible , actuality .
had i , in full , hideous fact , been drawn back to a world of a hundred and fifty million years ago in those dark , baffling days of the amnesia ?
had my present body been the vehicle of a frightful alien consciousness from palaeogean gulfs of time ?
had i , as the captive mind of those shambling horrors , indeed known that accursed city of stone in its primordial heyday , and wriggled down those familiar corridors in the loathsome shape of my captor ?
were those tormenting dreams of more than twenty years the offspring of stark , monstrous memories ?
had i once veritably talked with minds from reachless corners of time and space , learned the universe secrets , past and to come , and written the annals of my own world for the metal cases of those titan archives ?
and were those others those shocking elder things of the mad winds and daemon pipings in truth a lingering , lurking menace , waiting and slowly weakening in black abysses while varied shapes of life drag out their multimillennial courses on the planet surface ?
i do not know .
if that abyss and what i held were real , there is no hope .
then , all too truly , there lies upon this world of man a mocking and incredible shadow out of time .
but , mercifully , there is no proof that these things are other than fresh phases of my dreams .
i did not bring back the metal case that would have been a proof , and so far those subterrene corridors have not been found .
if the laws of the universe are kind , they will never be found .
but i must tell my son what i saw or thought i saw , and let him use his judgment as a psychologist in gauging the reality of my experience , and communicating this account to others .
i have said that the awful truth behind my tortured years of dreaming hinges absolutely upon the actuality of what i thought i saw in those cyclopean , buried ruins .
it has been hard for me , literally , to set down that crucial revelation , though no reader can have failed to guess it .
of course , it lay in that book within the metal case the case which i pried out of its lair amidst the dust of a million centuries .
no eye had seen , no hand had touched that book since the advent of man to this planet .
and yet , when i flashed my torch upon it in that frightful abyss , i saw that the queerly pigmented letters on the brittle , cellulose pages were not indeed any nameless hieroglyphs of earth youth .
they were , instead , the letters of our familiar alphabet , spelling out the words of the english language in my own handwriting .
i i am forced into speech because men of science have refused to follow my advice without knowing why .
it is altogether against my will that i tell my reasons for opposing this contemplated invasion of the antarctic with its vast fossil hunt and its wholesale boring and melting of the ancient ice caps .
and i am the more reluctant because my warning may be in vain .
doubt of the real facts , as i must reveal them , is inevitable ; yet , if i suppressed what will seem extravagant and incredible , there would be nothing left .
the hitherto withheld photographs , both ordinary and aerial , will count in my favor , for they are damnably vivid and graphic .
still , they will be doubted because of the great lengths to which clever fakery can be carried .
the ink drawings , of course , will be jeered at as obvious impostures , notwithstanding a strangeness of technique which art experts ought to remark and puzzle over .
in the end i must rely on the judgment and standing of the few scientific leaders who have , on the one hand , sufficient independence of thought to weigh my data on its own hideously convincing merits or in the light of certain primordial and highly baffling myth cycles ; and on the other hand , sufficient influence to deter the exploring world in general from any rash and program in the region of those mountains of madness .
it is an unfortunate fact that relatively obscure men like myself and my associates , connected only with a small university , have little chance of making an impression where matters of a wildly bizarre or highly controversial nature are concerned .
it is further against us that we are not , in the strictest sense , specialists in the fields which came primarily to be concerned .
as a geologist , my object in leading the miskatonic university expedition was wholly that of securing specimens of rock and soil from various parts of the antarctic continent , aided by the remarkable drill devised by professor frank pabodie of our engineering department .
i had no wish to be a pioneer in any other field than this , but i did hope that the use of this new mechanical appliance at different points along previously explored paths would bring to light materials of a sort hitherto unreached by the ordinary methods of collection .
pabodie drilling apparatus , as the public already knows from our reports , was unique and radical in its lightness , portability , and capacity to combine the ordinary artesian drill principle with the principle of the small circular rock drill in such a way as to cope quickly with strata of varying hardness .
steel head , jointed rods , gasoline motor , collapsible wooden derrick , dynamiting paraphernalia , cording , auger , and sectional piping for bores five inches wide and up to one thousand feet deep all formed , with needed accessories , no greater load than three sledges could carry .
this was made possible by the clever aluminum alloy of which most of the metal objects were fashioned .
four large dornier aeroplanes , designed especially for the tremendous altitude flying necessary on the antarctic plateau and with added and devices worked out by pabodie , could transport our entire expedition from a base at the edge of the great ice barrier to various suitable inland points , and from these points a sufficient quota of dogs would serve us .
we planned to cover as great an area as one antarctic season or longer , if absolutely necessary would permit , operating mostly in the mountain ranges and on the plateau south of ross sea ; regions explored in varying degree by shackleton , amundsen , scott , and byrd .
with frequent changes of camp , made by aeroplane and involving distances great enough to be of geological significance , we expected to unearth a quite unprecedented amount of material especially in the strata of which so narrow a range of antarctic specimens had previously been secured .
we wished also to obtain as great as possible a variety of the upper fossiliferous rocks , since the primal life history of this bleak realm of ice and death is of the highest importance to our knowledge of the earth past .
that the antarctic continent was once temperate and even tropical , with a teeming vegetable and animal life of which the lichens , marine fauna , arachnida , and penguins of the northern edge are the only survivals , is a matter of common information ; and we hoped to expand that information in variety , accuracy , and detail .
when a simple boring revealed fossiliferous signs , we would enlarge the aperture by blasting , in order to get specimens of suitable size and condition .
our borings , of varying depth according to the promise held out by the upper soil or rock , were to be confined to exposed , or nearly exposed , land surfaces these inevitably being slopes and ridges because of the mile or thickness of solid ice overlying the lower levels .
we could not afford to waste drilling the depth of any considerable amount of mere glaciation , though pabodie had worked out a plan for sinking copper electrodes in thick clusters of borings and melting off limited areas of ice with current from a dynamo .
it is this plan which we could not put into effect except experimentally on an expedition such as ours that the coming expedition proposes to follow , despite the warnings i have issued since our return from the antarctic .
the public knows of the miskatonic expedition through our frequent wireless reports to the arkham advertiser and associated press , and through the later articles of pabodie and myself .
we consisted of four men from the university pabodie , lake of the biology department , atwood of the physics department also a meteorologist and myself , representing geology and having nominal command besides sixteen assistants seven graduate students from miskatonic and nine skilled mechanics .
of these sixteen , twelve were qualified aeroplane pilots , all but two of whom were competent wireless operators .
eight of them understood navigation with compass and sextant , as did pabodie , atwood , and i .
in addition , of course , our two ships wooden , reinforced for ice conditions and having auxiliary steam were fully manned .
the nathaniel derby pickman foundation , aided by a few special contributions , financed the expedition ; hence our preparations were extremely thorough , despite the absence of great publicity .
the dogs , sledges , machines , camp materials , and unassembled parts of our five planes were delivered in boston , and there our ships were loaded .
we were marvelously for our specific purposes , and in all matters pertaining to supplies , regimen , transportation , and camp construction we profited by the excellent example of our many recent and exceptionally brilliant predecessors .
it was the unusual number and fame of these predecessors which made our own expedition ample though it was so little noticed by the world at large .
as the newspapers told , we sailed from boston harbor on september , , taking a leisurely course down the coast and through the panama canal , and stopping at samoa and hobart , tasmania , at which latter place we took on final supplies .
none of our exploring party had ever been in the polar regions before , hence we all relied greatly on our ship captains j .
douglas , commanding the brig arkham , and serving as commander of the sea party , and georg thorfinnssen , commanding the barque miskatonic both veteran whalers in antarctic waters .
as we left the inhabited world behind , the sun sank lower and lower in the north , and stayed longer and longer above the horizon each day .
at about south latitude we sighted our first icebergs objects with vertical sides and just before reaching the antarctic circle , which we crossed on october with appropriately quaint ceremonies , we were considerably troubled with field ice .
the falling temperature bothered me considerably after our long voyage through the tropics , but i tried to brace up for the worse rigors to come .
on many occasions the curious atmospheric effects enchanted me vastly ; these including a strikingly vivid mirage the first i had ever seen in which distant bergs became the battlements of unimaginable cosmic castles .
pushing through the ice , which was fortunately neither extensive nor thickly packed , we regained open water at south latitude , east longitude on the morning of october a strong land blink appeared on the south , and before noon we all felt a thrill of excitement at beholding a vast , lofty , and mountain chain which opened out and covered the whole vista ahead .
at last we had encountered an outpost of the great unknown continent and its cryptic world of frozen death .
these peaks were obviously the admiralty range discovered by ross , and it would now be our task to round cape adare and sail down the east coast of victoria land to our contemplated base on the shore of mcmurdo sound , at the foot of the volcano erebus in south latitude ' .
the last lap of the voyage was vivid and .
great barren peaks of mystery loomed up constantly against the west as the low northern sun of noon or the still lower southern sun of midnight poured its hazy reddish rays over the white snow , bluish ice and water lanes , and black bits of exposed granite slope .
through the desolate summits swept ranging , intermittent gusts of the terrible antarctic wind ; whose cadences sometimes held vague suggestions of a wild and musical piping , with notes extending over a wide range , and which for some subconscious mnemonic reason seemed to me disquieting and even dimly terrible .
something about the scene reminded me of the strange and disturbing asian paintings of nicholas roerich , and of the still stranger and more disturbing descriptions of the evilly fabled plateau of leng which occur in the dreaded necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred .
i was rather sorry , later on , that i had ever looked into that monstrous book at the college library .
on the of november , sight of the westward range having been temporarily lost , we passed franklin island ; and the next day descried the cones of mts .
erebus and terror on ross island ahead , with the long line of the parry mountains beyond .
there now stretched off to the east the low , white line of the great ice barrier , rising perpendicularly to a height of two hundred feet like the rocky cliffs of quebec , and marking the end of southward navigation .
in the afternoon we entered mcmurdo sound and stood off the coast in the lee of smoking mt .
erebus .
the scoriac peak towered up some twelve thousand , seven hundred feet against the eastern sky , like a japanese print of the sacred fujiyama , while beyond it rose the white , ghostlike height of mt .
terror , ten thousand , nine hundred feet in altitude , and now extinct as a volcano .
puffs of smoke from erebus came intermittently , and one of the graduate assistants a brilliant young fellow named danforth pointed out what looked like lava on the snowy slope , remarking that this mountain , discovered in , had undoubtedly been the source of poe image when he wrote seven years later the lavas that restlessly roll their sulphurous currents down yaanek in the ultimate climes of the pole that groan as they roll down mount yaanek in the realms of the boreal pole .
danforth was a great reader of bizarre material , and had talked a good deal of poe .
i was interested myself because of the antarctic scene of poe only long story the disturbing and enigmatical arthur gordon pym .
on the barren shore , and on the lofty ice barrier in the background , myriads of grotesque penguins squawked and flapped their fins , while many fat seals were visible on the water , swimming or sprawling across large cakes of slowly drifting ice .
using small boats , we effected a difficult landing on ross island shortly after midnight on the morning of the , carrying a line of cable from each of the ships and preparing to unload supplies by means of a arrangement .
our sensations on first treading antarctic soil were poignant and complex , even though at this particular point the scott and shackleton expeditions had preceded us .
our camp on the frozen shore below the volcano slope was only a provisional one , headquarters being kept aboard the arkham .
we landed all our drilling apparatus , dogs , sledges , tents , provisions , gasoline tanks , experimental outfit , cameras , both ordinary and aerial , aeroplane parts , and other accessories , including three small portable wireless outfits besides those in the planes capable of communicating with the arkham large outfit from any part of the antarctic continent that we would be likely to visit .
the ship outfit , communicating with the outside world , was to convey press reports to the arkham advertiser powerful wireless station on kingsport head , massachusetts .
we hoped to complete our work during a single antarctic summer ; but if this proved impossible , we would winter on the arkham , sending the miskatonic north before the freezing of the ice for another summer supplies .
i need not repeat what the newspapers have already published about our early work of our ascent of mt .
erebus ; our successful mineral borings at several points on ross island and the singular speed with which pabodie apparatus accomplished them , even through solid rock layers ; our provisional test of the small equipment ; our perilous ascent of the great barrier with sledges and supplies ; and our final assembling of five huge aeroplanes at the camp atop the barrier .
the health of our land party twenty men and alaskan sledge dogs was remarkable , though of course we had so far encountered no really destructive temperatures or windstorms .
for the most part , the thermometer varied between zero and or above , and our experience with new england winters had accustomed us to rigors of this sort .
the barrier camp was , and destined to be a storage cache for gasoline , provisions , dynamite , and other supplies .
only four of our planes were needed to carry the actual exploring material , the fifth being left with a pilot and two men from the ships at the storage cache to form a means of reaching us from the arkham in case all our exploring planes were lost .
later , when not using all the other planes for moving apparatus , we would employ one or two in a shuttle transportation service between this cache and another permanent base on the great plateau from six hundred to seven hundred miles southward , beyond beardmore glacier .
despite the almost unanimous accounts of appalling winds and tempests that pour down from the plateau , we determined to dispense with intermediate bases , taking our chances in the interest of economy and probable efficiency .
wireless reports have spoken of the breathtaking , , nonstop flight of our squadron on november over the lofty shelf ice , with vast peaks rising on the west , and the unfathomed silences echoing to the sound of our engines .
wind troubled us only moderately , and our radio compasses helped us through the one opaque fog we encountered .
when the vast rise loomed ahead , between latitudes and , we knew we had reached beardmore glacier , the largest valley glacier in the world , and that the frozen sea was now giving place to a frowning and mountainous coast line .
at last we were truly entering the white , world of the ultimate south .
even as we realized it we saw the peak of mt .
nansen in the eastern distance , towering up to its height of almost fifteen thousand feet .
the successful establishment of the southern base above the glacier in latitude ' , east longitude ' , and the phenomenally rapid and effective borings and blastings made at various points reached by our sledge trips and short aeroplane flights , are matters of history ; as is the arduous and triumphant ascent of mt .
nansen by pabodie and two of the graduate students gedney and carroll on december .
we were some eight thousand , five hundred feet above , and when experimental drillings revealed solid ground only twelve feet down through the snow and ice at certain points , we made considerable use of the small melting apparatus and sunk bores and performed dynamiting at many places where no previous explorer had ever thought of securing mineral specimens .
the granites and beacon sandstones thus obtained confirmed our belief that this plateau was homogeneous , with the great bulk of the continent to the west , but somewhat different from the parts lying eastward below south america which we then thought to form a separate and smaller continent divided from the larger one by a frozen junction of ross and weddell seas , though byrd has since disproved the hypothesis .
in certain of the sandstones , dynamited and chiseled after boring revealed their nature , we found some highly interesting fossil markings and fragments ; notably ferns , seaweeds , trilobites , crinoids , and such mollusks as linguellae and gastropods all of which seemed of real significance in connection with the region primordial history .
there was also a queer triangular , striated marking , about a foot in greatest diameter , which lake pieced together from three fragments of slate brought up from a aperture .
these fragments came from a point to the westward , near the queen alexandra range ; and lake , as a biologist , seemed to find their curious marking unusually puzzling and provocative , though to my geological eye it looked not unlike some of the ripple effects reasonably common in the sedimentary rocks .
since slate is no more than a metamorphic formation into which a sedimentary stratum is pressed , and since the pressure itself produces odd distorting effects on any markings which may exist , i saw no reason for extreme wonder over the striated depression .
on january , , lake , pabodie , danforth , the other six students , and myself flew directly over the south pole in two of the great planes , being forced down once by a sudden high wind , which , fortunately , did not develop into a typical storm .
this was , as the papers have stated , one of several observation flights , during others of which we tried to discern new topographical features in areas unreached by previous explorers .
our early flights were disappointing in this latter respect , though they afforded us some magnificent examples of the richly fantastic and deceptive mirages of the polar regions , of which our sea voyage had given us some brief foretastes .
distant mountains floated in the sky as enchanted cities , and often the whole white world would dissolve into a gold , silver , and scarlet land of dunsanian dreams and adventurous expectancy under the magic of the low midnight sun .
on cloudy days we had considerable trouble in flying owing to the tendency of snowy earth and sky to merge into one mystical opalescent void with no visible horizon to mark the junction of the two .
at length we resolved to carry out our original plan of flying five hundred miles eastward with all four exploring planes and establishing a fresh at a point which would probably be on the smaller continental division , as we mistakenly conceived it .
geological specimens obtained there would be desirable for purposes of comparison .
our health so far had remained excellent lime juice well offsetting the steady diet of tinned and salted food , and temperatures generally above zero enabling us to do without our thickest furs .
it was now midsummer , and with haste and care we might be able to conclude work by march and avoid a tedious wintering through the long antarctic night .
several savage windstorms had burst upon us from the west , but we had escaped damage through the skill of atwood in devising rudimentary aeroplane shelters and windbreaks of heavy snow blocks , and reinforcing the principal camp buildings with snow .
our good luck and efficiency had indeed been almost uncanny .
the outside world knew , of course , of our program , and was told also of lake strange and dogged insistence on a westward or rather , northwestward prospecting trip before our radical shift to the new base .
it seems that he had pondered a great deal , and with alarmingly radical daring , over that triangular striated marking in the slate ; reading into it certain contradictions in nature and geological period which whetted his curiosity to the utmost , and made him avid to sink more borings and blastings in the formation to which the exhumed fragments evidently belonged .
he was strangely convinced that the marking was the print of some bulky , unknown , and radically unclassifiable organism of considerably advanced evolution , notwithstanding that the rock which bore it was of so vastly ancient a date cambrian if not actually as to preclude the probable existence not only of all highly evolved life , but of any life at all above the unicellular or at most the trilobite stage .
these fragments , with their odd marking , must have been five hundred million to a thousand million years old .
popular imagination , i judge , responded actively to our wireless bulletins of lake start northwestward into regions never trodden by human foot or penetrated by human imagination , though we did not mention his wild hopes of revolutionizing the entire sciences of biology and geology .
his preliminary sledging and boring journey of january to with pabodie and five others marred by the loss of two dogs in an upset when crossing one of the great pressure ridges in the ice had brought up more and more of the archaean slate ; and even i was interested by the singular profusion of evident fossil markings in that unbelievably ancient stratum .
these markings , however , were of very primitive life forms involving no great paradox except that any life forms should occur in rock as definitely as this seemed to be ; hence i still failed to see the good sense of lake demand for an interlude in our program an interlude requiring the use of all four planes , many men , and the whole of the expedition mechanical apparatus .
i did not , in the end , veto the plan , though i decided not to accompany the northwestward party despite lake plea for my geological advice .
while they were gone , i would remain at the base with pabodie and five men and work out final plans for the eastward shift .
in preparation for this transfer , one of the planes had begun to move up a good gasoline supply from mcmurdo sound ; but this could wait temporarily .
i kept with me one sledge and nine dogs , since it is unwise to be at any time without possible transportation in an utterly tenantless world of death .
lake into the unknown , as everyone will recall , sent out its own reports from the shortwave transmitters on the planes ; these being simultaneously picked up by our apparatus at the southern base and by the arkham at mcmurdo sound , whence they were relayed to the outside world on wave lengths up to fifty meters .
the start was made january at , and the first wireless message we received came only two hours later , when lake spoke of descending and starting a and bore at a point some three hundred miles away from us .
six hours after that a second and very excited message told of the frantic , work whereby a shallow shaft had been sunk and blasted , culminating in the discovery of slate fragments with several markings approximately like the one which had caused the original puzzlement .
three hours later a brief bulletin announced the resumption of the flight in the teeth of a raw and piercing gale ; and when i dispatched a message of protest against further hazards , lake replied curtly that his new specimens made any hazard worth taking .
i saw that his excitement had reached the point of mutiny , and that i could do nothing to check this headlong risk of the whole expedition success ; but it was appalling to think of his plunging deeper and deeper into that treacherous and sinister white immensity of tempests and unfathomed mysteries which stretched off for some fifteen hundred miles to the , coast line of queen mary and knox lands .
then , in about an hour and a half more , came that doubly excited message from lake moving plane , which almost reversed my sentiments and made me wish i had accompanied the party on the wing .
after snowstorm , have spied mountain range ahead higher than any hitherto seen .
may equal himalayas , allowing for height of plateau .
probable latitude ' , longitude ' reaches far as can see to right and left .
suspicion of two smoking cones .
all peaks black and bare of snow .
gale blowing off them impedes navigation .
after that pabodie , the men and i hung breathlessly over the receiver .
thought of this titanic mountain rampart seven hundred miles away inflamed our deepest sense of adventure ; and we rejoiced that our expedition , if not ourselves personally , had been its discoverers .
in half an hour lake called us again moulton plane forced down on plateau in foothills , but nobody hurt and perhaps can repair .
shall transfer essentials to other three for return or further moves if necessary , but no more heavy plane travel needed just now .
mountains surpass anything in imagination .
am going up scouting in carroll plane , with all weight out .
you ca imagine anything like this .
highest peaks must go over thousand feet .
everest out of the running .
atwood to work out height with theodolite while carroll and i go up .
probably wrong about cones , for formations look stratified .
possibly slate with other strata mixed in .
queer skyline effects regular sections of cubes clinging to highest peaks .
whole thing marvelous in light of low sun .
like land of mystery in a dream or gateway to forbidden world of untrodden wonder .
wish you were here to study .
though it was technically sleeping time , not one of us listeners thought for a moment of retiring .
it must have been a good deal the same at mcmurdo sound , where the supply cache and the arkham were also getting the messages ; for captain douglas gave out a call congratulating everybody on the important find , and sherman , the cache operator , seconded his sentiments .
we were sorry , of course , about the damaged aeroplane , but hoped it could be easily mended .
then , at , came another call from lake up with carroll over highest foothills .
do dare try really tall peaks in present weather , but shall later .
frightful work climbing , and hard going at this altitude , but worth it .
great range fairly solid , hence ca get any glimpses beyond .
main summits exceed himalayas , and very queer .
range looks like slate , with plain signs of many other upheaved strata .
was wrong about volcanism .
goes farther in either direction than we can see .
swept clear of snow above about thousand feet .
odd formations on slopes of highest mountains .
great low square blocks with exactly vertical sides , and rectangular lines of low , vertical ramparts , like the old asian castles clinging to steep mountains in roerich paintings .
impressive from distance .
flew close to some , and carroll thought they were formed of smaller separate pieces , but that is probably weathering .
most edges crumbled and rounded off as if exposed to storms and climate changes for millions of years .
parts , especially upper parts , seem to be of rock than any visible strata on slopes proper , hence of evidently crystalline origin .
close flying shows many cave mouths , some unusually regular in outline , square or semicircular .
you must come and investigate .
think i saw rampart squarely on top of one peak .
height seems about thirty thousand to thousand feet .
am up thousand , five hundred myself , in devilish , gnawing cold .
wind whistles and pipes through passes and in and out of caves , but no flying danger so far .
from then on for another half hour lake kept up a running fire of comment , and expressed his intention of climbing some of the peaks on foot .
i replied that i would join him as soon as he could send a plane , and that pabodie and i would work out the best gasoline plan just where and how to concentrate our supply in view of the expedition altered character .
obviously , lake boring operations , as well as his aeroplane activities , would require a great deal for the new base which he planned to establish at the foot of the mountains ; and it was possible that the eastward flight might not be made , after all , this season .
in connection with this business i called captain douglas and asked him to get as much as possible out of the ships and up the barrier with the single dog team we had left there .
a direct route across the unknown region between lake and mcmurdo sound was what we really ought to establish .
lake called me later to say that he had decided to let the camp stay where moulton plane had been forced down , and where repairs had already progressed somewhat .
the ice sheet was very thin , with dark ground here and there visible , and he would sink some borings and blasts at that very point before making any sledge trips or climbing expeditions .
he spoke of the ineffable majesty of the whole scene , and the queer state of his sensations at being in the lee of vast , silent pinnacles whose ranks shot up like a wall reaching the sky at the world rim .
atwood theodolite observations had placed the height of the five tallest peaks at from thirty thousand to thousand feet .
the windswept nature of the terrain clearly disturbed lake , for it argued the occasional existence of prodigious gales , violent beyond anything we had so far encountered .
his camp lay a little more than five miles from where the higher foothills rose abruptly .
i could almost trace a note of subconscious alarm in his words flashed across a glacial void of seven hundred miles as he urged that we all hasten with the matter and get the strange , new region disposed of as soon as possible .
he was about to rest now , after a continuous day work of almost unparalleled speed , strenuousness , and results .
in the morning i had a wireless talk with lake and captain douglas at their widely separated bases .
it was agreed that one of lake planes would come to my base for pabodie , the five men , and myself , as well as for all the fuel it could carry .
the rest of the fuel question , depending on our decision about an easterly trip , could wait for a few days , since lake had enough for immediate camp heat and borings .
eventually the old southern base ought to be restocked , but if we postponed the easterly trip we would not use it till the next summer , and , meanwhile , lake must send a plane to explore a direct route between his new mountains and mcmurdo sound .
pabodie and i prepared to close our base for a short or long period , as the case might be .
if we wintered in the antarctic we would probably fly straight from lake base to the arkham without returning to this spot .
some of our conical tents had already been reinforced by blocks of hard snow , and now we decided to complete the job of making a permanent village .
owing to a very liberal tent supply , lake had with him all that his base would need , even after our arrival .
i wirelessed that pabodie and i would be ready for the northwestward move after one day work and one night rest .
our labors , however , were not very steady after , for about that time lake began sending in the most extraordinary and excited messages .
his working day had started unpropitiously , since an aeroplane survey of the rock surfaces showed an entire absence of those archaean and primordial strata for which he was looking , and which formed so great a part of the colossal peaks that loomed up at a tantalizing distance from the camp .
most of the rocks glimpsed were apparently jurassic and comanchian sandstones and permian and triassic schists , with now and then a glossy black outcropping suggesting a hard and slaty coal .
this rather discouraged lake , whose plans all hinged on unearthing specimens more than five hundred million years older .
it was clear to him that in order to recover the archaean slate vein in which he had found the odd markings , he would have to make a long sledge trip from these foothills to the steep slopes of the gigantic mountains themselves .
he had resolved , nevertheless , to do some local boring as part of the expedition general program ; hence he set up the drill and put five men to work with it while the rest finished settling the camp and repairing the damaged aeroplane .
the softest visible rock a sandstone about a quarter of a mile from the camp had been chosen for the first sampling ; and the drill made excellent progress without much supplementary blasting .
it was about three hours afterward , following the first really heavy blast of the operation , that the shouting of the drill crew was heard ; and that young gedney the acting foreman rushed into the camp with the startling news .
they had struck a cave .
early in the boring the sandstone had given place to a vein of comanchian limestone , full of minute fossil cephalopods , corals , echini , and spirifera , and with occasional suggestions of siliceous sponges and marine vertebrate bones the latter probably of teleosts , sharks , and ganoids .
this , in itself , was important enough , as affording the first vertebrate fossils the expedition had yet secured ; but when shortly afterward the drill head dropped through the stratum into apparent vacancy , a wholly new and doubly intense wave of excitement spread among the excavators .
a blast had laid open the subterrene secret ; and now , through a jagged aperture perhaps five feet across and three feet thick , there yawned before the avid searchers a section of shallow limestone hollowing worn more than fifty million years ago by the trickling ground waters of a bygone tropic world .
the hollowed layer was not more than seven or eight feet deep but extended off indefinitely in all directions and had a fresh , slightly moving air which suggested its membership in an extensive subterranean system .
its roof and floor were abundantly equipped with large stalactites and stalagmites , some of which met in columnar form but important above all else was the vast deposit of shells and bones , which in places nearly choked the passage .
washed down from unknown jungles of mesozoic tree ferns and fungi , and forests of tertiary cycads , fan palms , and primitive angiosperms , this osseous medley contained representatives of more cretaceous , eocene , and other animal species than the greatest paleontologist could have counted or classified in a year .
mollusks , crustacean armor , fishes , amphibians , reptiles , birds , and early mammals great and small , known and unknown .
no wonder gedney ran back to the camp shouting , and no wonder everyone else dropped work and rushed headlong through the biting cold to where the tall derrick marked a gateway to secrets of inner earth and vanished aeons .
when lake had satisfied the first keen edge of his curiosity , he scribbled a message in his notebook and had young moulton run back to the camp to dispatch it by wireless .
this was my first word of the discovery , and it told of the identification of early shells , bones of ganoids and placoderms , remnants of labyrinthodonts and thecodonts , great mosasaur skull fragments , dinosaur vertebrae and armor plates , pterodactyl teeth and wing bones , archaeopteryx debris , miocene sharks ' teeth , primitive bird skulls , and other bones of archaic mammals such as palaeotheres , xiphodons , eohippi , oreodons , and titanotheres .
there was nothing as recent as a mastodon , elephant , true camel , deer , or bovine animal ; hence lake concluded that the last deposits had occurred during the oligocene age , and that the hollowed stratum had lain in its present dried , dead , and inaccessible state for at least thirty million years .
on the other hand , the prevalence of very early life forms was singular in the highest degree .
though the limestone formation was , on the evidence of such typical imbedded fossils as ventriculites , positively and unmistakably comanchian and not a particle earlier , the free fragments in the hollow space included a surprising proportion from organisms hitherto considered as peculiar to far older periods even rudimentary fishes , mollusks , and corals as remote as the silurian or ordovician .
the inevitable inference was that in this part of the world there had been a remarkable and unique degree of continuity between the life of over three hundred million years ago and that of only thirty million years ago .
how far this continuity had extended beyond the oligocene age when the cavern was closed was of course past all speculation .
in any event , the coming of the frightful ice in the pleistocene some five hundred thousand years ago a mere yesterday as compared with the age of this cavity must have put an end to any of the primal forms which had locally managed to outlive their common terms .
lake was not content to let his first message stand , but had another bulletin written and dispatched across the snow to the camp before moulton could get back .
after that moulton stayed at the wireless in one of the planes , transmitting to me and to the arkham for relaying to the outside world the frequent postscripts which lake sent him by a succession of messengers .
those who followed the newspapers will remember the excitement created among men of science by that afternoon reports reports which have finally led , after all these years , to the organization of that very expedition which i am so anxious to dissuade from its purposes .
i had better give the messages literally as lake sent them , and as our base operator mctighe translated them from the pencil shorthand fowler makes discovery of highest importance in sandstone and limestone fragments from blasts .
several distinct triangular striated prints like those in archaean slate , proving that source survived from over six hundred million years ago to comanchian times without more than moderate morphological changes and decrease in average size .
comanchian prints apparently more primitive or decadent , if anything , than older ones .

with nine men three left to guard the dogs we ought to manage the three sledges fairly well , though wind is bad .
must establish plane communication with mcmurdo sound and begin shipping material .
but i got to dissect one of these things before we take any rest .
wish i had a real laboratory here .
dyer better kick himself for having tried to stop my westward trip .
first the world greatest mountains , and then this .
if this last is the high spot of the expedition , i do know what is .
we made scientifically .
congrats , pabodie , on the drill that opened up the cave .
now will arkham please repeat description ?
the sensations of pabodie and myself at receipt of this report were almost beyond description , nor were our companions much behind us in enthusiasm .
mctighe , who had hastily translated a few high spots as they came from the droning receiving set , wrote out the entire message from his shorthand version as soon as lake operator signed off .
all appreciated the significance of the discovery , and i sent lake congratulations as soon as the arkham operator had repeated back the descriptive parts as requested ; and my example was followed by sherman from his station at the mcmurdo sound supply cache , as well as by captain douglas of the arkham .
later , as head of the expedition , i added some remarks to be relayed through the arkham to the outside world .
of course , rest was an absurd thought amidst this excitement ; and my only wish was to get to lake camp as quickly as i could .
it disappointed me when he sent word that a rising mountain gale made early aerial travel impossible .
but within an hour and a half interest again rose to banish disappointment .
lake , sending more messages , told of the completely successful transportation of the fourteen great specimens to the camp .
it had been a hard pull , for the things were surprisingly heavy ; but nine men had accomplished it very neatly .
now some of the party were hurriedly building a snow corral at a safe distance from the camp , to which the dogs could be brought for greater convenience in feeding .
the specimens were laid out on the hard snow near the camp , save for one on which lake was making crude attempts at dissection .
this dissection seemed to be a greater task than had been expected , for , despite the heat of a gasoline stove in the newly raised laboratory tent , the deceptively flexible tissues of the chosen specimen a powerful and intact one lost nothing of their more than leathery toughness .
lake was puzzled as to how he might make the requisite incisions without violence destructive enough to upset all the structural niceties he was looking for .
he had , it is true , seven more perfect specimens ; but these were too few to use up recklessly unless the cave might later yield an unlimited supply .
accordingly he removed the specimen and dragged in one which , though having remnants of the starfish arrangements at both ends , was badly crushed and partly disrupted along one of the great torso furrows .
results , quickly reported over the wireless , were baffling and provocative indeed .
nothing like delicacy or accuracy was possible with instruments hardly able to cut the anomalous tissue , but the little that was achieved left us all awed and bewildered .
existing biology would have to be wholly revised , for this thing was no product of any cell growth science knows about .
there had been scarcely any mineral replacement , and despite an age of perhaps forty million years , the internal organs were wholly intact .
the leathery , undeteriorative , and almost indestructible quality was an inherent attribute of the thing form of organization , and pertained to some paleogean cycle of invertebrate evolution utterly beyond our powers of speculation .
at first all that lake found was dry , but as the heated tent produced its thawing effect , organic moisture of pungent and offensive odor was encountered toward the thing uninjured side .
it was not blood , but a thick , fluid apparently answering the same purpose .
by the time lake reached this stage , all dogs had been brought to the still uncompleted corral near the camp , and even at that distance set up a savage barking and show of restlessness at the acrid , diffusive smell .
far from helping to place the strange entity , this provisional dissection merely deepened its mystery .
all guesses about its external members had been correct , and on the evidence of these one could hardly hesitate to call the thing animal ; but internal inspection brought up so many vegetable evidences that lake was left hopelessly at sea .
it had digestion and circulation , and eliminated waste matter through the reddish tubes of its base .
cursorily , one would say that its respiration apparatus handled oxygen rather than carbon dioxide , and there were odd evidences of chambers and methods of shifting respiration from the external orifice to at least two other fully developed breathing systems gills and pores .
clearly , it was amphibian , and probably adapted to long airless hibernation periods as well .
vocal organs seemed present in connection with the main respiratory system , but they presented anomalies beyond immediate solution .
articulate speech , in the sense of syllable utterance , seemed barely conceivable , but musical piping notes covering a wide range were highly probable .
the muscular system was almost prematurely developed .
the nervous system was so complex and highly developed as to leave lake aghast .
though excessively primitive and archaic in some respects , the thing had a set of ganglial centers and connectives arguing the very extremes of specialized development .
its brain was surprisingly advanced , and there were signs of a sensory equipment , served in part through the wiry cilia of the head , involving factors alien to any other terrestrial organism .
probably it has more than five senses , so that its habits could not be predicted from any existing analogy .
it must , lake thought , have been a creature of keen sensitiveness and delicately differentiated functions in its primal world much like the ants and bees of today .
it reproduced like the vegetable cryptogams , especially the pteridophyta , having spore cases at the tips of the wings and evidently developing from a thallus or prothallus .
but to give it a name at this stage was mere folly .
it looked like a radiate , but was clearly something more .
it was partly vegetable , but had of the essentials of animal structure .
that it was marine in origin , its symmetrical contour and certain other attributes clearly indicated ; yet one could not be exact as to the limit of its later adaptations .
the wings , after all , held a persistent suggestion of the aerial .
how it could have undergone its tremendously complex evolution on a earth in time to leave prints in archaean rocks was so far beyond conception as to make lake whimsically recall the primal myths about great old ones who filtered down from the stars and concocted earth life as a joke or mistake ; and the wild tales of cosmic hill things from outside told by a folklorist colleague in miskatonic english department .
naturally , he considered the possibility of the prints having been made by a less evolved ancestor of the present specimens , but quickly rejected this theory upon considering the advanced structural qualities of the older fossils .
if anything , the later contours showed decadence rather than higher evolution .
the size of the pseudofeet had decreased , and the whole morphology seemed coarsened and simplified .
moreover , the nerves and organs just examined held singular suggestions of retrogression from forms still more complex .
atrophied and vestigial parts were surprisingly prevalent .
altogether , little could be said to have been solved ; and lake fell back on mythology for a provisional name jocosely dubbing his finds the elder ones .
at about , having decided to postpone further work and get a little rest , he covered the dissected organism with a tarpaulin , emerged from the laboratory tent , and studied the intact specimens with renewed interest .
the ceaseless antarctic sun had begun to limber up their tissues a trifle , so that the head points and tubes of two or three showed signs of unfolding ; but lake did not believe there was any danger of immediate decomposition in the almost subzero air .
he did , however , move all the undissected specimens close together and throw a spare tent over them in order to keep off the direct solar rays .
that would also help to keep their possible scent away from the dogs , whose hostile unrest was really becoming a problem , even at their substantial distance and behind the higher and higher snow walls which an increased quota of the men were hastening to raise around their quarters .
he had to weight down the corners of the tent cloth with heavy blocks of snow to hold it in place amidst the rising gale , for the titan mountains seemed about to deliver some gravely severe blasts .
early apprehensions about sudden antarctic winds were revived , and under atwood supervision precautions were taken to bank the tents , new dog corral , and crude aeroplane shelters with snow on the mountainward side .
these latter shelters , begun with hard snow blocks during odd moments , were by no means as high as they should have been ; and lake finally detached all hands from other tasks to work on them .
it was after four when lake at last prepared to sign off and advised us all to share the rest period his outfit would take when the shelter walls were a little higher .
he held some friendly chat with pabodie over the ether , and repeated his praise of the really marvelous drills that had helped him make his discovery .
atwood also sent greetings and praises .
i gave lake a warm word of congratulations , owning up that he was right about the western trip , and we all agreed to get in touch by wireless at ten in the morning .
if the gale was then over , lake would send a plane for the party at my base .
just before retiring i dispatched a final message to the arkham with instructions about toning down the day news for the outside world , since the full details seemed radical enough to rouse a wave of incredulity until further substantiated .
none of us , i imagine , slept very heavily or continuously that morning .
both the excitement of lake discovery and the mounting fury of the wind were against such a thing .
so savage was the blast , even where we were , that we could not help wondering how much worse it was at lake camp , directly under the vast unknown peaks that bred and delivered it .
mctighe was awake at ten and tried to get lake on the wireless , as agreed , but some electrical condition in the disturbed air to the westward seemed to prevent communication .
we did , however , get the arkham , and douglas told me that he had likewise been vainly trying to reach lake .
he had not known about the wind , for very little was blowing at mcmurdo sound , despite its persistent rage where we were .
throughout the day we all listened anxiously and tried to get lake at intervals , but invariably without results .
about noon a positive frenzy of wind stampeded out of the west , causing us to fear for the safety of our camp ; but it eventually died down , with only a moderate relapse at after three it was very quiet , and we redoubled our efforts to get lake .
reflecting that he had four planes , each provided with an excellent outfit , we could not imagine any ordinary accident capable of crippling all his wireless equipment at once .
nevertheless the stony silence continued , and when we thought of the delirious force the wind must have had in his locality we could not help making the more direful conjectures .
by six our fears had become intense and definite , and after a wireless consultation with douglas and thorfinnssen i resolved to take steps toward investigation .
the fifth aeroplane , which we had left at the mcmurdo sound supply cache with sherman and two sailors , was in good shape and ready for instant use , and it seemed that the very emergency for which it had been saved was now upon us .
i got sherman by wireless and ordered him to join me with the plane and the two sailors at the southern base as quickly as possible , the air conditions being apparently highly favorable .
we then talked over the personnel of the coming investigation party , and decided that we would include all hands , together with the sledge and dogs which i had kept with me .
even so great a load would not be too much for one of the huge planes built to our special orders for heavy machinery transportation .
at intervals i still tried to reach lake with the wireless , but all to no purpose .
sherman , with the sailors gunnarsson and larsen , took off at , and reported a quiet flight from several points on the wing .
they arrived at our base at midnight , and all hands at once discussed the next move .
it was risky business sailing over the antarctic in a single aeroplane without any line of bases , but no one drew back from what seemed like the plainest necessity .
we turned in at two for a brief rest after some preliminary loading of the plane , but were up again in four hours to finish the loading and packing .
at , january , we started flying northwestward under mctighe pilotage with ten men , seven dogs , a sledge , a fuel and food supply , and other items including the plane wireless outfit .
the atmosphere was clear , fairly quiet , and relatively mild in temperature , and we anticipated very little trouble in reaching the latitude and longitude designated by lake as the site of his camp .
our apprehensions were over what we might find , or fail to find , at the end of our journey , for silence continued to answer all calls dispatched to the camp .
every incident of that flight is burned into my recollection because of its crucial position in my life .
it marked my loss , at the age of , of all that peace and balance which the normal mind possesses through its accustomed conception of external nature and nature laws .
thenceforward the ten of us but the student danforth and myself above all others were to face a hideously amplified world of lurking horrors which nothing can erase from our emotions , and which we would refrain from sharing with mankind in general if we could .
the newspapers have printed the bulletins we sent from the moving plane , telling of our nonstop course , our two battles with treacherous gales , our glimpse of the broken surface where lake had sunk his shaft three days before , and our sight of a group of those strange fluffy snow cylinders noted by amundsen and byrd as rolling in the wind across the endless leagues of frozen plateau .
there came a point , though , when our sensations could not be conveyed in any words the press would understand , and a latter point when we had to adopt an actual rule of strict censorship .
the sailor larsen was first to spy the jagged line of witchlike cones and pinnacles ahead , and his shouts sent everyone to the windows of the great cabined plane .
despite our speed , they were very slow in gaining prominence ; hence we knew that they must be infinitely far off , and visible only because of their abnormal height .
little by little , however , they rose grimly into the western sky ; allowing us to distinguish various bare , bleak , blackish summits , and to catch the curious sense of fantasy which they inspired as seen in the reddish antarctic light against the provocative background of iridescent clouds .
in the whole spectacle there was a persistent , pervasive hint of stupendous secrecy and potential revelation .
it was as if these stark , nightmare spires marked the pylons of a frightful gateway into forbidden spheres of dream , and complex gulfs of remote time , space , and .
i could not help feeling that they were evil things mountains of madness whose farther slopes looked out over some accursed ultimate abyss .
that seething , cloud background held ineffable suggestions of a vague , ethereal beyondness far more than terrestrially spatial , and gave appalling reminders of the utter remoteness , separateness , desolation , and death of this untrodden and unfathomed austral world .
it was young danforth who drew our notice to the curious regularities of the higher mountain skyline regularities like clinging fragments of perfect cubes , which lake had mentioned in his messages , and which indeed justified his comparison with the dreamlike suggestions of primordial temple ruins , on cloudy asian mountaintops so subtly and strangely painted by roerich .
there was indeed something hauntingly about this whole unearthly continent of mountainous mystery .
i had felt it in october when we first caught sight of victoria land , and i felt it afresh now .
i felt , too , another wave of uneasy consciousness of archaean mythical resemblances ; of how disturbingly this lethal realm corresponded to the evilly famed plateau of leng in the primal writings .
mythologists have placed leng in central asia ; but the racial memory of man or of his predecessors is long , and it may well be that certain tales have come down from lands and mountains and temples of horror earlier than asia and earlier than any human world we know .
a few daring mystics have hinted at a origin for the fragmentary pnakotic manuscripts , and have suggested that the devotees of tsathoggua were as alien to mankind as tsathoggua itself .
leng , wherever in space or time it might brood , was not a region i would care to be in or near , nor did i relish the proximity of a world that had ever bred such ambiguous and archaean monstrosities as those lake had just mentioned .
at the moment i felt sorry that i had ever read the abhorred necronomicon , or talked so much with that unpleasantly erudite folklorist wilmarth at the university .
this mood undoubtedly served to aggravate my reaction to the bizarre mirage which burst upon us from the increasingly opalescent zenith as we drew near the mountains and began to make out the cumulative undulations of the foothills .
i had seen dozens of polar mirages during the preceding weeks , some of them quite as uncanny and fantastically vivid as the present example ; but this one had a wholly novel and obscure quality of menacing symbolism , and i shuddered as the seething labyrinth of fabulous walls and towers and minarets loomed out of the troubled ice vapors above our heads .
the effect was that of a cyclopean city of no architecture known to man or to human imagination , with vast aggregations of masonry embodying monstrous perversions of geometrical laws .
there were truncated cones , sometimes terraced or fluted , surmounted by tall cylindrical shafts here and there bulbously enlarged and often capped with tiers of thinnish scalloped disks ; and strange beetling , constructions suggesting piles of multitudinous rectangular slabs or circular plates or stars with each one overlapping the one beneath .
there were composite cones and pyramids either alone or surmounting cylinders or cubes or flatter truncated cones and pyramids , and occasional spires in curious clusters of five .
all of these febrile structures seemed knit together by tubular bridges crossing from one to the other at various dizzy heights , and the implied scale of the whole was terrifying and oppressive in its sheer gigantism .
the general type of mirage was not unlike some of the wilder forms observed and drawn by the arctic whaler scoresby in , but at this time and place , with those dark , unknown mountain peaks soaring stupendously ahead , that anomalous discovery in our minds , and the pall of probable disaster enveloping the greater part of our expedition , we all seemed to find in it a taint of latent malignity and infinitely evil portent .
i was glad when the mirage began to break up , though in the process the various nightmare turrets and cones assumed distorted , temporary forms of even vaster hideousness .
as the whole illusion dissolved to churning opalescence we began to look earthward again , and saw that our journey end was not far off .
the unknown mountains ahead rose dizzily up like a fearsome rampart of giants , their curious regularities showing with startling clearness even without a field glass .
we were over the lowest foothills now , and could see amidst the snow , ice , and bare patches of their main plateau a couple of darkish spots which we took to be lake camp and boring .
the higher foothills shot up between five and six miles away , forming a range almost distinct from the terrifying line of more than himalayan peaks beyond them .
at length ropes the student who had relieved mctighe at the controls began to head downward toward the dark spot whose size marked it as the camp .
as he did so , mctighe sent out the last uncensored wireless message the world was to receive from our expedition .
everyone , of course , has read the brief and unsatisfying bulletins of the rest of our antarctic sojourn .
some hours after our landing we sent a guarded report of the tragedy we found , and reluctantly announced the wiping out of the whole lake party by the frightful wind of the preceding day , or of the night before that .
eleven known dead , young gedney missing .
people pardoned our hazy lack of details through realization of the shock the sad event must have caused us , and believed us when we explained that the mangling action of the wind had rendered all eleven bodies unsuitable for transportation outside .
indeed , i flatter myself that even in the midst of our distress , utter bewilderment , and horror , we scarcely went beyond the truth in any specific instance .
the tremendous significance lies in what we dared not tell ; what i would not tell now but for the need of warning others off from nameless terrors .
it is a fact that the wind had brought dreadful havoc .
whether all could have lived through it , even without the other thing , is gravely open to doubt .
the storm , with its fury of madly driven ice particles , must have been beyond anything our expedition had encountered before .
one aeroplane , it seems , had been left in a far too flimsy and inadequate state was nearly pulverized and the derrick at the distant boring was entirely shaken to pieces .
the exposed metal of the grounded planes and drilling machinery was bruised into a high polish , and two of the small tents were flattened despite their snow banking .
wooden surfaces left out in the blaster were pitted and denuded of paint , and all signs of tracks in the snow were completely obliterated .
it is also true that we found none of the archaean biological objects in a condition to take outside as a whole .
we did gather some minerals from a vast , tumbled pile , including several of the greenish soapstone fragments whose odd rounding and faint patterns of grouped dots caused so many doubtful comparisons ; and some fossil bones , among which were the most typical of the curiously injured specimens .
none of the dogs survived , their hurriedly built snow inclosure near the camp being almost wholly destroyed .
the wind may have done that , though the greater breakage on the side next the camp , which was not the windward one , suggests an outward leap or break of the frantic beasts themselves .
all three sledges were gone , and we have tried to explain that the wind may have blown them off into the unknown .
the drill and machinery at the boring were too badly damaged to warrant salvage , so we used them to choke up that subtly disturbing gateway to the past which lake had blasted .
we likewise left at the camp the two most shaken up of the planes ; since our surviving party had only four real pilots sherman , danforth , mctighe , and ropes in all , with danforth in a poor nervous shape to navigate .
we brought back all the books , scientific equipment , and other incidentals we could find , though much was rather unaccountably blown away .
spare tents and furs were either missing or badly out of condition .
it was approximately , after wide plane cruising had forced us to give gedney up for lost , that we sent our guarded message to the arkham for relaying ; and i think we did well to keep it as calm and noncommittal as we succeeded in doing .
the most we said about agitation concerned our dogs , whose frantic uneasiness near the biological specimens was to be expected from poor lake accounts .
we did not mention , i think , their display of the same uneasiness when sniffing around the queer greenish soapstones and certain other objects in the disordered including scientific instruments , aeroplanes , and machinery , both at the camp and at the boring , whose parts had been loosened , moved , or otherwise tampered with by winds that must have harbored singular curiosity and investigativeness .
about the fourteen biological specimens , we were pardonably indefinite .
we said that the only ones we discovered were damaged , but that enough was left of them to prove lake description wholly and impressively accurate .
it was hard work keeping our personal emotions out of this matter and we did not mention numbers or say exactly how we had found those which we did find .
we had by that time agreed not to transmit anything suggesting madness on the part of lake men , and it surely looked like madness to find six imperfect monstrosities carefully buried upright in snow graves under mounds punched over with groups of dots in patterns exactly those on the queer greenish soapstones dug up from mesozoic or tertiary times .
the eight perfect specimens mentioned by lake seemed to have been completely blown away .
we were careful , too , about the public general peace of mind ; hence danforth and i said little about that frightful trip over the mountains the next day .
it was the fact that only a radically lightened plane could possibly cross a range of such height , which mercifully limited that scouting tour to the two of us .
on our return at one , danforth was close to hysterics , but kept an admirably stiff upper lip .
it took no persuasion to make him promise not to show our sketches and the other things we brought away in our pockets , not to say anything more to the others than what we had agreed to relay outside , and to hide our camera films for private development later on ; so that part of my present story will be as new to pabodie , mctighe , ropes , sherman , and the rest as it will be to the world in general .
indeed , danforth is closer mouthed than i for he saw , or thinks he saw , one thing he will not tell even me .
as all know , our report included a tale of a hard ascent a confirmation of lake opinion that the great peaks are of archaean slate and other very primal crumpled strata unchanged since at least middle comanchian times ; a conventional comment on the regularity of the clinging cube and rampart formations ; a decision that the cave mouths indicate dissolved calcaerous veins ; a conjecture that certain slopes and passes would permit of the scaling and crossing of the entire range by seasoned mountaineers ; and a remark that the mysterious other side holds a lofty and immense superplateau as ancient and unchanging as the mountains themselves twenty thousand feet in elevation , with grotesque rock formations protruding through a thin glacial layer and with low gradual foothills between the general plateau surface and the sheer precipices of the highest peaks .
this body of data is in every respect true so far as it goes , and it completely satisfied the men at the camp .
we laid our absence of sixteen hours a longer time than our announced flying , landing , reconnoitering , and program called for to a long mythical spell of adverse wind conditions , and told truly of our landing on the farther foothills .
fortunately our tale sounded realistic and prosaic enough not to tempt any of the others into emulating our flight .
had any tried to do that , i would have used every ounce of my persuasion to stop them and i do not know what danforth would have done .
while we were gone , pabodie , sherman , ropes , mctighe , and williamson had worked like beavers over lake two best planes , fitting them again for use despite the altogether unaccountable juggling of their operative mechanism .
we decided to load all the planes the next morning and start back for our old base as soon as possible .
even though indirect , that was the safest way to work toward mcmurdo sound ; for a straightline flight across the most utterly unknown stretches of the continent would involve many additional hazards .
further exploration was hardly feasible in view of our tragic decimation and the ruin of our drilling machinery .
the doubts and horrors around us which we did not reveal made us wish only to escape from this austral world of desolation and brooding madness as swiftly as we could .
as the public knows , our return to the world was accomplished without further disasters .
all planes reached the old base on the evening of the next day january after a swift nonstop flight ; and on the we made mcmurdo sound in two laps , the one pause being very brief , and occasioned by a faulty rudder in the furious wind over the ice shelf after we had cleared the great plateau .
in five days more , the arkham and miskatonic , with all hands and equipment on board , were shaking clear of the thickening field ice and working up ross sea with the mocking mountains of victoria land looming westward against a troubled antarctic sky and twisting the wind wails into a musical piping which chilled my soul to the quick .
less than a fortnight later we left the last hint of polar land behind us and thanked heaven that we were clear of a haunted , accursed realm where life and death , space and time , have made black and blasphemous alliances , in the unknown epochs since matter first writhed and swam on the planet crust .
since our return we have all constantly worked to discourage antarctic exploration , and have kept certain doubts and guesses to ourselves with splendid unity and faithfulness .
even young danforth , with his nervous breakdown , has not flinched or babbled to his doctors indeed , as i have said , there is one thing he thinks he alone saw which he will not tell even me , though i think it would help his psychological state if he would consent to do so .
it might explain and relieve much , though perhaps the thing was no more than the delusive aftermath of an earlier shock .
that is the impression i gather after those rare , irresponsible moments when he whispers disjointed things to me things which he repudiates vehemently as soon as he gets a grip on himself again .
it will be hard work deterring others from the great white south , and some of our efforts may directly harm our cause by drawing inquiring notice .
we might have known from the first that human curiosity is undying , and that the results we announced would be enough to spur others ahead on the same pursuit of the unknown .
lake reports of those biological monstrosities had aroused naturalists and paleontologists to the highest pitch , though we were sensible enough not to show the detached parts we had taken from the actual buried specimens , or our photographs of those specimens as they were found .
we also refrained from showing the more puzzling of the scarred bones and greenish soapstones ; while danforth and i have closely guarded the pictures we took or drew on the superplateau across the range , and the crumpled things we smoothed , studied in terror , and brought away in our pockets .
but now that party is organizing , and with a thoroughness far beyond anything our outfit attempted .
if not dissuaded , they will get to the innermost nucleus of the antarctic and melt and bore till they bring up that which we know may end the world .
so i must break through all reticences at last even about that ultimate , nameless thing beyond the mountains of madness .
it is only with vast hesitancy and repugnance that i let my mind go back to lake camp and what we really found there and to that other thing beyond the mountains of madness .
i am constantly tempted to shirk the details , and to let hints stand for actual facts and ineluctable deductions .
i hope i have said enough already to let me glide briefly over the rest ; the rest , that is , of the horror at the camp .
i have told of the terrain , the damaged shelters , the disarranged machinery , the varied uneasiness of our dogs , the missing sledges and other items , the deaths of men and dogs , the absence of gedney , and the six insanely buried biological specimens , strangely sound in texture for all their structural injuries , from a world forty million years dead .
i do not recall whether i mentioned that upon checking up the canine bodies we found one dog missing .
we did not think much about that till later indeed , only danforth and i have thought of it at all .
the principal things i have been keeping back relate to the bodies , and to certain subtle points which may or may not lend a hideous and incredible kind of rationale to the apparent chaos .
at the time , i tried to keep the men minds off those points ; for it was so much simpler so much more normal to lay everything to an outbreak of madness on the part of some of lake party .
from the look of things , that demon mountain wind must have been enough to drive any man mad in the midst of this center of all earthly mystery and desolation .
the crowning abnormality , of course , was the condition of the bodies men and dogs alike .
they had all been in some terrible kind of conflict , and were torn and mangled in fiendish and altogether inexplicable ways .
death , so far as we could judge , had in each case come from strangulation or laceration .
the dogs had evidently started the trouble , for the state of their corral bore witness to its forcible breakage from within .
it had been set some distance from the camp because of the hatred of the animals for those hellish archaean organisms , but the precaution seemed to have been taken in vain .
when left alone in that monstrous wind , behind flimsy walls of insufficient height , they must have stampeded whether from the wind itself , or from some subtle , increasing odor emitted by the nightmare specimens , one could not say .
but whatever had happened , it was hideous and revolting enough .
perhaps i had better put squeamishness aside and tell the worst at last though with a categorical statement of opinion , based on the observations and most rigid deductions of both danforth and myself , that the then missing gedney was in no way responsible for the loathsome horrors we found .
i have said that the bodies were frightfully mangled .
now i must add that some were incised and subtracted from in the most curious , , and inhuman fashion .
it was the same with dogs and men .
all the healthier , fatter bodies , quadrupedal or bipedal , had had their most solid masses of tissue cut out and removed , as by a careful butcher ; and around them was a strange sprinkling of salt taken from the ravaged provision chests on the planes which conjured up the most horrible associations .
the thing had occurred in one of the crude aeroplane shelters from which the plane had been dragged out , and subsequent winds had effaced all tracks which could have supplied any plausible theory .
scattered bits of clothing , roughly slashed from the human incision subjects , hinted no clues .
it is useless to bring up the half impression of certain faint snow prints in one shielded corner of the ruined inclosure because that impression did not concern human prints at all , but was clearly mixed up with all the talk of fossil prints which poor lake had been giving throughout the preceding weeks .
one had to be careful of one imagination in the lee of those overshadowing mountains of madness .
as i have indicated , gedney and one dog turned out to be missing in the end .
when we came on that terrible shelter we had missed two dogs and two men ; but the fairly unharmed dissecting tent , which we entered after investigating the monstrous graves , had something to reveal .
it was not as lake had left it , for the covered parts of the primal monstrosity had been removed from the improvised table .
indeed , we had already realized that one of the six imperfect and insanely buried things we had found the one with the trace of a peculiarly hateful odor must represent the collected sections of the entity which lake had tried to analyze .
on and around that laboratory table were strewn other things , and it did not take long for us to guess that those things were the carefully though oddly and inexpertly dissected parts of one man and one dog .
i shall spare the feelings of survivors by omitting mention of the man identity .
lake anatomical instruments were missing , but there were evidences of their careful cleansing .
the gasoline stove was also gone , though around it we found a curious litter of matches .
we buried the human parts beside the other ten men ; and the canine parts with the other dogs .
concerning the bizarre smudges on the laboratory table , and on the jumble of roughly handled illustrated books scattered near it , we were much too bewildered to speculate .
this formed the worst of the camp horror , but other things were equally perplexing .
the disappearance of gedney , the one dog , the eight uninjured biological specimens , the three sledges , and certain instruments , illustrated technical and scientific books , writing materials , electric torches and batteries , food and fuel , heating apparatus , spare tents , fur suits , and the like , was utterly beyond sane conjecture ; as were likewise the ink blots on certain pieces of paper , and the evidences of curious alien fumbling and experimentation around the planes and all other mechanical devices both at the camp and at the boring .
the dogs seemed to abhor this oddly disordered machinery .
then , too , there was the upsetting of the larder , the disappearance of certain staples , and the jarringly comical heap of tin cans pried open in the most unlikely ways and at the most unlikely places .
the profusion of scattered matches , intact , broken , or spent , formed another minor enigma as did the two or three tent cloths and fur suits which we found lying about with peculiar and unorthodox slashings conceivably due to clumsy efforts at unimaginable adaptations .
the maltreatment of the human and canine bodies , and the crazy burial of the damaged archaean specimens , were all of a piece with this apparent disintegrative madness .
in view of just such an eventuality as the present one , we carefully photographed all the main evidences of insane disorder at the camp ; and shall use the prints to buttress our pleas against the departure of the proposed expedition .
our first act after finding the bodies in the shelter was to photograph and open the row of insane graves with the snow mounds .
we could not help noticing the resemblance of these monstrous mounds , with their clusters of grouped dots , to poor lake descriptions of the strange greenish soapstones ; and when we came on some of the soapstones themselves in the great mineral pile , we found the likeness very close indeed .
the whole general formation , it must be made clear , seemed abominably suggestive of the starfish head of the archaean entities ; and we agreed that the suggestion must have worked potently upon the sensitized minds of lake overwrought party .
for madness centering in gedney as the only possible surviving agent was the explanation spontaneously adopted by everybody so far as spoken utterance was concerned ; though i will not be so naive as to deny that each of us may have harbored wild guesses which sanity forbade him to formulate completely .
sherman , pabodie , and mctighe made an exhaustive aeroplane cruise over all the surrounding territory in the afternoon , sweeping the horizon with field glasses in quest of gedney and of the various missing things ; but nothing came to light .
the party reported that the titan barrier range extended endlessly to right and left alike , without any diminution in height or essential structure .
on some of the peaks , though , the regular cube and rampart formations were bolder and plainer , having doubly fantastic similitudes to asian hill ruins .
the distribution of cryptical cave mouths on the black summits seemed roughly even as far as the range could be traced .
in spite of all the prevailing horrors , we were left with enough sheer scientific zeal and adventurousness to wonder about the unknown realm beyond those mysterious mountains .
as our guarded messages stated , we rested at midnight after our day of terror and bafflement but not without a tentative plan for one or more altitude flights in a lightened plane with aerial camera and geologist outfit , beginning the following morning .
it was decided that danforth and i try it first , and we awaked at intending an early flight ; however , heavy winds mentioned in our brief bulletin to the outside world delayed our start till nearly nine .
i have already repeated the noncommittal story we told the men at camp and relayed outside after our return sixteen hours later .
it is now my terrible duty to amplify this account by filling in the merciful blanks with hints of what we really saw in the hidden transmontane world hints of the revelations which have finally driven danforth to a nervous collapse .
i wish he would add a really frank word about the thing which he thinks he alone saw even though it was probably a nervous delusion and which was perhaps the last straw that put him where he is ; but he is firm against that .
all i can do is to repeat his later disjointed whispers about what set him shrieking as the plane soared back through the mountain pass after that real and tangible shock which i shared .
this will form my last word .
if the plain signs of surviving elder horrors in what i disclose be not enough to keep others from meddling with the inner antarctic or at least from prying too deeply beneath the surface of that ultimate waste of forbidden secrets and inhuman , desolation the responsibility for unnamable and perhaps immeasurable evils will not be mine .
danforth and i , studying the notes made by pabodie in his afternoon flight and checking up with a sextant , had calculated that the lowest available pass in the range lay somewhat to the right of us , within sight of camp , and about thousand or thousand feet above sea level .
for this point , then , we first headed in the lightened plane as we embarked on our flight of discovery .
the camp itself , on foothills which sprang from a high continental plateau , was some twelve thousand feet in altitude ; hence the actual height increase necessary was not so vast as it might seem .
nevertheless we were acutely conscious of the rarefied air and intense cold as we rose ; for , on account of visibility conditions , we had to leave the cabin windows open .
we were dressed , of course , in our heaviest furs .
as we drew near the forbidding peaks , dark and sinister above the line of snow and interstitial glaciers , we noticed more and more the curiously regular formations clinging to the slopes ; and thought again of the strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich .
the ancient and rock strata fully verified all of lake bulletins , and proved that these pinnacles had been towering up in exactly the same way since a surprisingly early time in earth history perhaps over fifty million years .
how much higher they had once been , it was futile to guess ; but everything about this strange region pointed to obscure atmospheric influences unfavorable to change , and calculated to retard the usual climatic processes of rock disintegration .
but it was the mountainside tangle of regular cubes , ramparts , and cave mouths which fascinated and disturbed us most .
i studied them with a field glass and took aerial photographs while danforth drove ; and at times i relieved him at the controls though my aviation knowledge was purely an amateur in order to let him use the binoculars .
we could easily see that much of the material of the things was a lightish archaean quartzite , unlike any formation visible over broad areas of the general surface ; and that their regularity was extreme and uncanny to an extent which poor lake had scarcely hinted .
as he had said , their edges were crumbled and rounded from untold aeons of savage weathering ; but their preternatural solidity and tough material had saved them from obliteration .
many parts , especially those closest to the slopes , seemed identical in substance with the surrounding rock surface .
the whole arrangement looked like the ruins of macchu picchu in the andes , or the primal foundation walls of kish as dug up by the oxford field museum expedition in ; and both danforth and i obtained that occasional impression of separate cyclopean blocks which lake had attributed to his carroll .
how to account for such things in this place was frankly beyond me , and i felt queerly humbled as a geologist .
igneous formations often have strange regularities like the famous giants ' causeway in ireland but this stupendous range , despite lake original suspicion of smoking cones , was above all else nonvolcanic in evident structure .
the curious cave mouths , near which the odd formations seemed most abundant , presented another albeit a lesser puzzle because of their regularity of outline .
they were , as lake bulletin had said , often approximately square or semicircular ; as if the natural orifices had been shaped to greater symmetry by some magic hand .
their numerousness and wide distribution were remarkable , and suggested that the whole region was honeycombed with tunnels dissolved out of limestone strata .
such glimpses as we secured did not extend far within the caverns , but we saw that they were apparently clear of stalactites and stalagmites .
outside , those parts of the mountain slopes adjoining the apertures seemed invariably smooth and regular ; and danforth thought that the slight cracks and pittings of the weathering tended toward unusual patterns .
filled as he was with the horrors and strangenesses discovered at the camp , he hinted that the pittings vaguely resembled those baffling groups of dots sprinkled over the primeval greenish soapstones , so hideously duplicated on the madly conceived snow mounds above those six buried monstrosities .
we had risen gradually in flying over the higher foothills and along toward the relatively low pass we had selected .
as we advanced we occasionally looked down at the snow and ice of the land route , wondering whether we could have attempted the trip with the simpler equipment of earlier days .
somewhat to our surprise we saw that the terrain was far from difficult as such things go ; and that despite the crevasses and other bad spots it would not have been likely to deter the sledges of a scott , a shackleton , or an amundsen .
some of the glaciers appeared to lead up to passes with unusual continuity , and upon reaching our chosen pass we found that its case formed no exception .
our sensations of tense expectancy as we prepared to round the crest and peer out over an untrodden world can hardly be described on paper ; even though we had no cause to think the regions beyond the range essentially different from those already seen and traversed .
the touch of evil mystery in these barrier mountains , and in the beckoning sea of opalescent sky glimpsed betwixt their summits , was a highly subtle and attenuated matter not to be explained in literal words .
rather was it an affair of vague psychological symbolism and aesthetic association a thing mixed up with exotic poetry and paintings , and with archaic myths lurking in shunned and forbidden volumes .
even the wind burden held a peculiar strain of conscious malignity ; and for a second it seemed that the composite sound included a bizarre musical whistling or piping over a wide range as the blast swept in and out of the omnipresent and resonant cave mouths .
there was a cloudy note of reminiscent repulsion in this sound , as complex and unplaceable as any of the other dark impressions .
we were now , after a slow ascent , at a height of thousand , five hundred and seventy feet according to the aneroid ; and had left the region of clinging snow definitely below us .
up here were only dark , bare rock slopes and the start of glaciers but with those provocative cubes , ramparts , and echoing cave mouths to add a portent of the unnatural , the fantastic , and the dreamlike .
looking along the line of high peaks , i thought i could see the one mentioned by poor lake , with a rampart exactly on top .
it seemed to be half lost in a queer antarctic haze such a haze , perhaps , as had been responsible for lake early notion of volcanism .
the pass loomed directly before us , smooth and windswept between its jagged and malignly frowning pylons .
beyond it was a sky fretted with swirling vapors and lighted by the low polar sun the sky of that mysterious farther realm upon which we felt no human eye had ever gazed .
a few more feet of altitude and we would behold that realm .
danforth and i , unable to speak except in shouts amidst the howling , piping wind that raced through the pass and added to the noise of the unmuffled engines , exchanged eloquent glances .
and then , having gained those last few feet , we did indeed stare across the momentous divide and over the unsampled secrets of an elder and utterly alien earth .
v i think that both of us simultaneously cried out in mixed awe , wonder , terror , and disbelief in our own senses as we finally cleared the pass and saw what lay beyond .
of course , we must have had some natural theory in the back of our heads to steady our faculties for the moment .
probably we thought of such things as the grotesquely weathered stones of the garden of the gods in colorado , or the fantastically symmetrical rocks of the arizona desert .
perhaps we even half thought the sight a mirage like that we had seen the morning before on first approaching those mountains of madness .
we must have had some such normal notions to fall back upon as our eyes swept that limitless , plateau and grasped the almost endless labyrinth of colossal , regular , and geometrically eurythmic stone masses which reared their crumbled and pitted crests above a glacial sheet not more than forty or fifty feet deep at its thickest , and in places obviously thinner .
the effect of the monstrous sight was indescribable , for some fiendish violation of known natural law seemed certain at the outset .
here , on a hellishly ancient fully twenty thousand feet high , and in a climate deadly to habitation since a prehuman age not less than five hundred thousand years ago , there stretched nearly to the vision limit a tangle of orderly stone which only the desperation of mental could possibly attribute to any but conscious and artificial cause .
we had previously dismissed , so far as serious thought was concerned , any theory that the cubes and ramparts of the mountainsides were other than natural in origin .
how could they be otherwise , when man himself could scarcely have been differentiated from the great apes at the time when this region succumbed to the present unbroken reign of glacial death ?
yet now the sway of reason seemed irrefutably shaken , for this cyclopean maze of squared , curved , and angled blocks had features which cut off all comfortable refuge .
it was , very clearly , the blasphemous city of the mirage in stark , objective , and ineluctable reality .
that damnable portent had had a material basis after all there had been some horizontal stratum of ice dust in the upper air , and this shocking stone survival had projected its image across the mountains according to the simple laws of reflection , of course , the phantom had been twisted and exaggerated , and had contained things which the real source did not contain ; yet now , as we saw that real source , we thought it even more hideous and menacing than its distant image .
only the incredible , unhuman massiveness of these vast stone towers and ramparts had saved the frightful things from utter annihilation in the hundreds of thousands perhaps millions of years it had brooded there amidst the blasts of a bleak upland .
corona mundi roof of the world all sorts of fantastic phrases sprang to our lips as we looked dizzily down at the unbelievable spectacle .
i thought again of the eldritch primal myths that had so persistently haunted me since my first sight of this dead antarctic world of the demoniac plateau of leng , of the , or abominable snow men of the himalayas , of the pnakotic manuscripts with their prehuman implications , of the cthulhu cult , of the necronomicon , and of the hyperborean legends of formless tsathoggua and the worse than formless star spawn associated with that semientity .
for boundless miles in every direction the thing stretched off with very little thinning ; indeed , as our eyes followed it to the right and left along the base of the low , gradual foothills which separated it from the actual mountain rim , we decided that we could see no thinning at all except for an interruption at the left of the pass through which we had come .
we had merely struck , at random , a limited part of something of incalculable extent .
the foothills were more sparsely sprinkled with grotesque stone structures , linking the terrible city to the already familiar cubes and ramparts which evidently formed its mountain outposts .
these latter , as well as the queer cave mouths , were as thick on the inner as on the outer sides of the mountains .
the nameless stone labyrinth consisted , for the most part , of walls from ten to one hundred and fifty feet in height , and of a thickness varying from five to ten feet .
it was composed mostly of prodigious blocks of dark primordial slate , schist , and sandstone blocks in many cases as large as x x feet though in several places it seemed to be carved out of a solid , uneven bed rock of slate .
the buildings were far from equal in size , there being innumerable honeycomb arrangements of enormous extent as well as smaller separate structures .
the general shape of these things tended to be conical , pyramidal , or terraced ; though there were many perfect cylinders , perfect cubes , clusters of cubes , and other rectangular forms , and a peculiar sprinkling of angled edifices whose ground plan roughly suggested modern fortifications .
the builders had made constant and expert use of the principle of the arch , and domes had probably existed in the city heyday .
the whole tangle was monstrously weathered , and the glacial surface from which the towers projected was strewn with fallen blocks and immemorial debris .
where the glaciation was transparent we could see the lower parts of the gigantic piles , and we noticed the stone bridges which connected the different towers at varying distances above the ground .
on the exposed walls we could detect the scarred places where other and higher bridges of the same sort had existed .
closer inspection revealed countless largish windows ; some of which were closed with shutters of a petrified material originally wood , though most gaped open in a sinister and menacing fashion .
many of the ruins , of course , were roofless , and with uneven though upper edges ; whilst others , of a more sharply conical or pyramidal model or else protected by higher surrounding structures , preserved intact outlines despite the omnipresent crumbling and pitting .
with the field glass we could barely make out what seemed to be sculptural decorations in horizontal bands decorations including those curious groups of dots whose presence on the ancient soapstones now assumed a vastly larger significance .
in many places the buildings were totally ruined and the ice sheet deeply riven from various geologic causes .
in other places the stonework was worn down to the very level of the glaciation .
one broad swath , extending from the plateau interior , to a cleft in the foothills about a mile to the left of the pass we had traversed , was wholly free from buildings .
it probably represented , we concluded , the course of some great river which in tertiary times millions of years ago had poured through the city and into some prodigious subterranean abyss of the great barrier range .
certainly , this was above all a region of caves , gulfs , and underground secrets beyond human penetration .
looking back to our sensations , and recalling our dazedness at viewing this monstrous survival from aeons we had thought prehuman , i can only wonder that we preserved the semblance of equilibrium , which we did .
of course , we knew that something chronology , scientific theory , or our own consciousness was woefully awry ; yet we kept enough poise to guide the plane , observe many things quite minutely , and take a careful series of photographs which may yet serve both us and the world in good stead .
in my case , ingrained scientific habit may have helped ; for above all my bewilderment and sense of menace , there burned a dominant curiosity to fathom more of this secret to know what sort of beings had built and lived in this incalculably gigantic place , and what relation to the general world of its time or of other times so unique a concentration of life could have had .
for this place could be no ordinary city .
it must have formed the primary nucleus and center of some archaic and unbelievable chapter of earth history whose outward ramifications , recalled only dimly in the most obscure and distorted myths , had vanished utterly amidst the chaos of terrene convulsions long before any human race we know had shambled out of apedom .
here sprawled a palaeogaean megalopolis compared with which the fabled atlantis and lemuria , commoriom and uzuldaroum , and olathoc in the land of lomar , are recent things of today not even of yesterday ; a megalopolis ranking with such whispered prehuman blasphemies as valusia , , ib in the land of mnar , and the nameless city of arabia deserta .
as we flew above that tangle of stark titan towers my imagination sometimes escaped all bounds and roved aimlessly in realms of fantastic associations even weaving links betwixt this lost world and some of my own wildest dreams concerning the mad horror at the camp .
the plane fuel tank , in the interest of greater lightness , had been only partly filled ; hence we now had to exert caution in our explorations .
even so , however , we covered an enormous extent of ground or , rather , air after swooping down to a level where the wind became virtually negligible .
there seemed to be no limit to the mountain range , or to the length of the frightful stone city which bordered its inner foothills .
fifty miles of flight in each direction showed no major change in the labyrinth of rock and masonry that clawed up corpselike through the eternal ice .
there were , though , some highly absorbing diversifications ; such as the carvings on the canyon where that broad river had once pierced the foothills and approached its sinking place in the great range .
the headlands at the stream entrance had been boldly carved into cyclopean pylons ; and something about the ridgy , designs stirred up oddly vague , hateful , and confusing in both danforth and me .
we also came upon several open spaces , evidently public squares , and noted various undulations in the terrain .
where a sharp hill rose , it was generally hollowed out into some sort of edifice ; but there were at least two exceptions .
of these latter , one was too badly weathered to disclose what had been on the jutting eminence , while the other still bore a fantastic conical monument carved out of the solid rock and roughly resembling such things as the snake tomb in the ancient valley of petra .
flying inland from the mountains , we discovered that the city was not of infinite width , even though its length along the foothills seemed endless .
after about thirty miles the grotesque stone buildings began to thin out , and in ten more miles we came to an unbroken waste virtually without signs of sentient artifice .
the course of the river beyond the city seemed marked by a broad , depressed line , while the land assumed a somewhat greater ruggedness , seeming to slope slightly upward as it receded in the west .
so far we had made no landing , yet to leave the plateau without an attempt at entering some of the monstrous structures would have been inconceivable .
accordingly , we decided to find a smooth place on the foothills near our navigable pass , there grounding the plane and preparing to do some exploration on foot .
though these gradual slopes were partly covered with a scattering of ruins , low flying soon disclosed an ampler number of possible landing places .
selecting that nearest to the pass , since our flight would be across the great range and back to camp , we succeeded about in effecting a landing on a smooth , hard snow field wholly devoid of obstacles and well adapted to a swift and favorable later on .
it did not seem necessary to protect the plane with a snow banking for so brief a time and in so comfortable an absence of high winds at this level ; hence we merely saw that the landing skis were safely lodged , and that the vital parts of the mechanism were guarded against the cold .
for our foot journey we discarded the heaviest of our flying furs , and took with us a small outfit consisting of pocket compass , hand camera , light provisions , voluminous notebooks and paper , geologist hammer and chisel , specimen bags , coil of climbing rope , and powerful electric torches with extra batteries ; this equipment having been carried in the plane on the chance that we might be able to effect a landing , take ground pictures , make drawings and topographical sketches , and obtain rock specimens from some bare slope , outcropping , or mountain cave .
fortunately we had a supply of extra paper to tear up , place in a spare specimen bag , and use on the ancient principle of hare and hounds for marking our course in any interior mazes we might be able to penetrate .
this had been brought in case we found some cave system with air quiet enough to allow such a rapid and easy method in place of the usual method of trail blazing .
walking cautiously downhill over the crusted snow toward the stupendous stone labyrinth that loomed against the opalescent west , we felt almost as keen a sense of imminent marvels as we had felt on approaching the unfathomed mountain pass four hours previously .
true , we had become visually familiar with the incredible secret concealed by the barrier peaks ; yet the prospect of actually entering primordial walls reared by conscious beings perhaps millions of years ago before any known race of men could have existed was none the less awesome and potentially terrible in its implications of cosmic abnormality .
though the thinness of the air at this prodigious altitude made exertion somewhat more difficult than usual , both danforth and i found ourselves bearing up very well , and felt equal to almost any task which might fall to our lot .
it took only a few steps to bring us to a shapeless ruin worn level with the snow , while ten or fifteen rods farther on there was a huge , roofless rampart still complete in its gigantic outline and rising to an irregular height of ten or eleven feet .
for this latter we headed ; and when at last we were actually able to touch its weathered cyclopean blocks , we felt that we had established an unprecedented and almost blasphemous link with forgotten aeons normally closed to our species .
this rampart , shaped like a star and perhaps three hundred feet from point to point , was built of jurassic sandstone blocks of irregular size , averaging x feet in surface .
there was a row of arched loopholes or windows about four feet wide and five feet high , spaced quite symmetrically along the points of the star and at its inner angles , and with the bottoms about four feet from the glaciated surface .
looking through these , we could see that the masonry was fully five feet thick , that there were no partitions remaining within , and that there were traces of banded carvings or on the interior walls facts we had indeed guessed before , when flying low over this rampart and others like it .
though lower parts must have originally existed , all traces of such things were now wholly obscured by the deep layer of ice and snow at this point .
we crawled through one of the windows and vainly tried to decipher the nearly effaced mural designs , but did not attempt to disturb the glaciated floor .
our orientation flights had indicated that many buildings in the city proper were less , and that we might perhaps find wholly clear interiors leading down to the true ground level if we entered those structures still roofed at the top .
before we left the rampart we photographed it carefully , and studied its cyclopean masonry with complete bewilderment .
we wished that pabodie were present , for his engineering knowledge might have helped us guess how such titanic blocks could have been handled in that unbelievably remote age when the city and its outskirts were built up .
the walk downhill to the actual city , with the upper wind shrieking vainly and savagely through the skyward peaks in the background , was something of which the smallest details will always remain engraved on my mind .
only in fantastic nightmares could any human beings but danforth and me conceive such optical effects .
between us and the churning vapors of the west lay that monstrous tangle of dark stone towers , its outre and incredible forms impressing us afresh at every new angle of vision .
it was a mirage in solid stone , and were it not for the photographs , i would still doubt that such a thing could be .
the general type of masonry was identical with that of the rampart we had examined ; but the extravagant shapes which this masonry took in its urban manifestations were past all description .
even the pictures illustrate only one or two phases of its endless variety , preternatural massiveness , and utterly alien exoticism .
there were geometrical forms for which an euclid would scarcely find a name cones of all degrees of irregularity and truncation , terraces of every sort of provocative disproportion , shafts with odd bulbous enlargements , broken columns in curious groups , and or arrangements of mad grotesqueness .
as we drew nearer we could see beneath certain transparent parts of the ice sheet , and detect some of the tubular stone bridges that connected the crazily sprinkled structures at various heights .
of orderly streets there seemed to be none , the only broad open swath being a mile to the left , where the ancient river had doubtless flowed through the town into the mountains .
our field glasses showed the external , horizontal bands of nearly effaced sculptures and dot groups to be very prevalent , and we could half imagine what the city must once have looked like even though most of the roofs and tower tops had necessarily perished .
as a whole , it had been a complex tangle of twisted lanes and alleys , all of them deep canyons , and some little better than tunnels because of the overhanging masonry or overarching bridges .
now , outspread below us , it loomed like a dream fantasy against a westward mist through whose northern end the low , reddish antarctic sun of early afternoon was struggling to shine ; and when , for a moment , that sun encountered a denser obstruction and plunged the scene into temporary shadow , the effect was subtly menacing in a way i can never hope to depict .
even the faint howling and piping of the unfelt wind in the great mountain passes behind us took on a wilder note of purposeful malignity .
the last stage of our descent to the town was unusually steep and abrupt , and a rock outcropping at the edge where the grade changed led us to think that an artificial terrace had once existed there .
under the glaciation , we believed , there must be a flight of steps or its equivalent .
when at last we plunged into the town itself , clambering over fallen masonry and shrinking from the oppressive nearness and dwarfing height of omnipresent crumbling and pitted walls , our sensations again became such that i marvel at the amount of we retained .
danforth was frankly jumpy , and began making some offensively irrelevant speculations about the horror at the camp which i resented all the more because i could not help sharing certain conclusions forced upon us by many features of this morbid survival from nightmare antiquity .
the speculations worked on his imagination , too ; for in one place where a alley turned a sharp corner he insisted that he saw faint traces of ground markings which he did not like ; whilst elsewhere he stopped to listen to a subtle , imaginary sound from some undefined point a muffled musical piping , he said , not unlike that of the wind in the mountain caves , yet somehow disturbingly different .
the ceaseless of the surrounding architecture and of the few distinguishable mural arabesques had a dimly sinister suggestiveness we could not escape , and gave us a touch of terrible subconscious certainty concerning the primal entities which had reared and dwelt in this unhallowed place .
nevertheless , our scientific and adventurous souls were not wholly dead , and we mechanically carried out our program of chipping specimens from all the different rock types represented in the masonry .
we wished a rather full set in order to draw better conclusions regarding the age of the place .
nothing in the great outer walls seemed to date from later than the jurassic and comanchian periods , nor was any piece of stone in the entire place of a greater recency than the pliocene age .
in stark certainty , we were wandering amidst a death which had reigned at least five hundred thousand years , and in all probability even longer .
as we proceeded through this maze of twilight we stopped at all available apertures to study interiors and investigate entrance possibilities .
some were above our reach , whilst others led only into ruins as unroofed and barren as the rampart on the hill .
one , though spacious and inviting , opened on a seemingly bottomless abyss without visible means of descent .
now and then we had a chance to study the petrified wood of a surviving shutter , and were impressed by the fabulous antiquity implied in the still discernible grain .
these things had come from mesozoic gymnosperms and conifers especially cretaceous cycads and from fan palms and early angiosperms of plainly tertiary date .
nothing definitely later than the pliocene could be discovered .
in the placing of these shutters whose edges showed the former presence of queer and hinges usage seemed to be varied some being on the outer and some on the inner side of the deep embrasures .
they seemed to have become wedged in place , thus surviving the rusting of their former and probably metallic fixtures and fastenings .
after a time we came across a row of windows in the bulges of a colossal cone of undamaged apex which led into a vast , room with stone flooring ; but these were too high in the room to permit descent without a rope .
we had a rope with us , but did not wish to bother with this drop unless obliged to especially in this thin plateau air where great demands were made upon the heart action .
this enormous room was probably a hall or concourse of some sort , and our electric torches showed bold , distinct , and potentially startling sculptures arranged round the walls in broad , horizontal bands separated by equally broad strips of conventional arabesques .
we took careful note of this spot , planning to enter here unless a more easily gained interior were encountered .
finally , though , we did encounter exactly the opening we wished ; an archway about six feet wide and ten feet high , marking the former end of an aerial bridge which had spanned an alley about five feet above the present level of glaciation .
these archways , of course , were flush with floors , and in this case one of the floors still existed .
the building thus accessible was a series of rectangular terraces on our left facing westward .
that across the alley , where the other archway yawned , was a decrepit cylinder with no windows and with a curious bulge about ten feet above the aperture .
it was totally dark inside , and the archway seemed to open on a well of illimitable emptiness .
heaped debris made the entrance to the vast building doubly easy , yet for a moment we hesitated before taking advantage of the chance .
for though we had penetrated into this tangle of archaic mystery , it required fresh resolution to carry us actually inside a complete and surviving building of a fabulous elder world whose nature was becoming more and more hideously plain to us .
in the end , however , we made the plunge , and scrambled up over the rubble into the gaping embrasure .
the floor beyond was of great slate slabs , and seemed to form the outlet of a long , high corridor with sculptured walls .
observing the many inner archways which led off from it , and realizing the probable complexity of the nest of apartments within , we decided that we must begin our system of trail blazing .
hitherto our compasses , together with frequent glimpses of the vast mountain range between the towers in our rear , had been enough to prevent our losing our way ; but from now on , the artificial substitute would be necessary .
accordingly we reduced our extra paper to shreds of suitable size , placed these in a bag to be carried by danforth , and prepared to use them as economically as safety would allow .
this method would probably gain us immunity from straying , since there did not appear to be any strong air currents inside the primordial masonry .
if such should develop , or if our paper supply should give out , we could of course fall back on the more secure though more tedious and retarding method of rock chipping .
just how extensive a territory we had opened up , it was impossible to guess without a trial .
the close and frequent connection of the different buildings made it likely that we might cross from one to another on bridges underneath the ice , except where impeded by local collapses and geologic rifts , for very little glaciation seemed to have entered the massive constructions .
almost all the areas of transparent ice had revealed the submerged windows as tightly shuttered , as if the town had been left in that uniform state until the glacial sheet came to crystallize the lower part for all succeeding time .
indeed , one gained a curious impression that this place had been deliberately closed and deserted in some dim , bygone aeon , rather than overwhelmed by any sudden calamity or even gradual decay .
had the coming of the ice been foreseen , and had a nameless population left en masse to seek a less doomed abode ?
the precise physiographic conditions attending the formation of the ice sheet at this point would have to wait for later solution .
it had not , very plainly , been a grinding drive .
perhaps the pressure of accumulated snows had been responsible , and perhaps some flood from the river , or from the bursting of some ancient glacial dam in the great range , had helped to create the special state now observable .
imagination could conceive almost anything in connection with this place .
it would be cumbrous to give a detailed , consecutive account of our wanderings inside that cavernous , honeycomb of primal masonry that monstrous lair of elder secrets which now echoed for the first time , after uncounted epochs , to the tread of human feet .
this is especially true because so much of the horrible drama and revelation came from a mere study of the omnipresent mural carvings .
our flashlight photographs of those carvings will do much toward proving the truth of what we are now disclosing , and it is lamentable that we had not a larger film supply with us .
as it was , we made crude notebook sketches of certain salient features after all our films were used up .
the building which we had entered was one of great size and elaborateness , and gave us an impressive notion of the architecture of that nameless geologic past .
the inner partitions were less massive than the outer walls , but on the lower levels were excellently preserved .
labyrinthine complexity , involving curiously irregular difference in floor levels , characterized the entire arrangement ; and we should certainly have been lost at the very outset but for the trail of torn paper left behind us .
we decided to explore the more decrepit upper parts first of all , hence climbed aloft in the maze for a distance of some one hundred feet , to where the topmost tier of chambers yawned snowily and ruinously open to the polar sky .
ascent was effected over the steep , transversely ribbed stone ramps or inclined planes which everywhere served in lieu of stairs .
the rooms we encountered were of all imaginable shapes and proportions , ranging from stars to triangles and perfect cubes .
it might be safe to say that their general average was about x feet in floor area , and feet in height , though many larger apartments existed .
after thoroughly examining the upper regions and the glacial level , we descended , story by story , into the submerged part , where indeed we soon saw we were in a continuous maze of connected chambers and passages probably leading over unlimited areas outside this particular building .
the cyclopean massiveness and gigantism of everything about us became curiously oppressive ; and there was something vaguely but deeply unhuman in all the contours , dimensions , proportions , decorations , and constructional nuances of the blasphemously archaic stonework .
we soon realized , from what the carvings revealed , that this monstrous city was many million years old .
we can not yet explain the engineering principles used in the anomalous balancing and adjustment of the vast rock masses , though the function of the arch was clearly much relied on .
the rooms we visited were wholly bare of all portable contents , a circumstance which sustained our belief in the city deliberate desertion .
the prime decorative feature was the almost universal system of mural sculpture , which tended to run in continuous horizontal bands three feet wide and arranged from floor to ceiling in alternation with bands of equal width given over to geometrical arabesques .
there were exceptions to this rule of arrangement , but its preponderance was overwhelming .
often , however , a series of smooth cartouches containing oddly patterned groups of dots would be sunk along one of the arabesque bands .
the technique , we soon saw , was mature , accomplished , and aesthetically evolved to the highest degree of civilized mastery , though utterly alien in every detail to any known art tradition of the human race .
in delicacy of execution no sculpture i have ever seen could approach it .
the minutest details of elaborate vegetation , or of animal life , were rendered with astonishing vividness despite the bold scale of the carvings ; whilst the conventional designs were marvels of skillful intricacy .
the arabesques displayed a profound use of mathematical principles , and were made up of obscurely symmetrical curves and angles based on the quantity of five .
the pictorial bands followed a highly formalized tradition , and involved a peculiar treatment of perspective , but had an artistic force that moved us profoundly , notwithstanding the intervening gulf of vast geologic periods .
their method of design hinged on a singular juxtaposition of the cross section with the silhouette , and embodied an analytical psychology beyond that of any known race of antiquity .
it is useless to try to compare this art with any represented in our museums .
those who see our photographs will probably find its closest analogue in certain grotesque conceptions of the most daring futurists .
the arabesque tracery consisted altogether of depressed lines , whose depth on unweathered walls varied from one to two inches .
when cartouches with dot groups appeared evidently as inscriptions in some unknown and primordial language and alphabet the depression of the smooth surface was perhaps an inch and a half , and of the dots perhaps a half inch more .
the pictorial bands were in countersunk low relief , their background being depressed about two inches from the original wall surface .
in some specimens marks of a former coloration could be detected , though for the most part the untold aeons had disintegrated and banished any pigments which may have been applied .
the more one studied the marvelous technique , the more one admired the things .
beneath their strict conventionalization one could grasp the minute and accurate observation and graphic skill of the artists ; and indeed , the very conventions themselves served to symbolize and accentuate the real essence or vital differentiation of every object delineated .
we felt , too , that besides these recognizable excellences there were others lurking beyond the reach of our perceptions .
certain touches here and there gave vague hints of latent symbols and stimuli which another mental and emotional background , and a fuller or different sensory equipment , might have made of profound and poignant significance to us .
the subject matter of the sculptures obviously came from the life of the vanished epoch of their creation , and contained a large proportion of evident history .
it is this abnormal of the primal race a chance circumstance operating , through coincidence , miraculously in our favor which made the carvings so awesomely informative to us , and which caused us to place their photography and transcription above all other considerations .
in certain rooms the dominant arrangement was varied by the presence of maps , astronomical charts , and other scientific designs of an enlarged scale these things giving a naive and terrible corroboration to what we gathered from the pictorial friezes and dadoes .
in hinting at what the whole revealed , i can only hope that my account will not arouse a curiosity greater than sane caution on the part of those who believe me at all .
it would be tragic if any were to be allured to that realm of death and horror by the very warning meant to discourage them .
interrupting these sculptured walls were high windows and massive doorways ; both now and then retaining the petrified wooden planks elaborately carved and polished of the actual shutters and doors .
all metal fixtures had long ago vanished , but some of the doors remained in place and had to be forced aside as we progressed from room to room .
window frames with odd transparent panes mostly elliptical survived here and there , though in no considerable quantity .
there were also frequent niches of great magnitude , generally empty , but once in a while containing some bizarre object carved from green soapstone which was either broken or perhaps held too inferior to warrant removal .
other apertures were undoubtedly connected with bygone mechanical facilities heating , lighting , and the like of a sort suggested in many of the carvings .
ceilings tended to be plain , but had sometimes been inlaid with green soapstone or other tiles , mostly fallen now .
floors were also paved with such tiles , though plain stonework predominated .
as i have said , all furniture and other movables were absent ; but the sculptures gave a clear idea of the strange devices which had once filled these tomblike , echoing rooms .
above the glacial sheet the floors were generally thick with detritus , litter , and debris , but farther down this condition decreased .
in some of the lower chambers and corridors there was little more than gritty dust or ancient incrustations , while occasional areas had an uncanny air of newly swept immaculateness .
of course , where rifts or collapses had occurred , the lower levels were as littered as the upper ones .
a central court as in other structures we had seen from the air saved the inner regions from total darkness ; so that we seldom had to use our electric torches in the upper rooms except when studying sculptured details .
below the ice cap , however , the twilight deepened ; and in many parts of the tangled ground level there was an approach to absolute blackness .
to form even a rudimentary idea of our thoughts and feelings as we penetrated this maze of unhuman masonry , one must correlate a hopelessly bewildering chaos of fugitive moods , memories , and impressions .
the sheer appalling antiquity and lethal desolation of the place were enough to overwhelm almost any sensitive person , but added to these elements were the recent unexplained horror at the camp , and the revelations all too soon effected by the terrible mural sculptures around us .
the moment we came upon a perfect section of carving , where no ambiguity of interpretation could exist , it took only a brief study to give us the hideous truth a truth which it would be naive to claim danforth and i had not independently suspected before , though we had carefully refrained from even hinting it to each other .
there could now be no further merciful doubt about the nature of the beings which had built and inhabited this monstrous dead city millions of years ago , when man ancestors were primitive archaic mammals , and vast dinosaurs roamed the tropical steppes of europe and asia .
we had previously clung to a desperate alternative and insisted each to himself that the omnipresence of the motifs meant only some cultural or religious exaltation of the archaean natural object which had so patently embodied the quality of ; as the decorative motifs of minoan crete exalted the sacred bull , those of egypt the scarabaeus , those of rome the wolf and the eagle , and those of various savage tribes some chosen totem animal .
but this lone refuge was now stripped from us , and we were forced to face definitely the realization which the reader of these pages has doubtless long ago anticipated .
i can scarcely bear to write it down in black and white even now , but perhaps that will not be necessary .
the things once rearing and dwelling in this frightful masonry in the age of dinosaurs were not indeed dinosaurs , but far worse .
mere dinosaurs were new and almost brainless objects but the builders of the city were wise and old , and had left certain traces in rocks even then laid down well nigh a thousand million years rocks laid down before the true life of earth had advanced beyond plastic groups of cells rocks laid down before the true life of earth had existed at all .
they were the makers and enslavers of that life , and above all doubt the originals of the fiendish elder myths which things like the pnakotic manuscripts and the necronomicon affrightedly hint about .
they were the great old ones that had filtered down from the stars when earth was young the beings whose substance an alien evolution had shaped , and whose powers were such as this planet had never bred .
and to think that only the day before , danforth and i had actually looked upon fragments of their millennially fossilized substance , and that poor lake and his party had seen their complete outlines .
it is of course impossible for me to relate in proper order the stages by which we picked up what we know of that monstrous chapter of prehuman life .
after the first shock of the certain revelation , we had to pause a while to recuperate , and it was fully three before we got started on our actual tour of systematic research .
the sculptures in the building we entered were of relatively late date perhaps two million years ago as checked up by geological , biological , and astronomical features and embodied an art which would be called decadent in comparison with that of specimens we found in older buildings after crossing bridges under the glacial sheet .
one edifice hewn from the solid rock seemed to go back forty or possibly even fifty million years to the lower eocene or upper cretaceous and contained bas reliefs of an artistry surpassing anything else , with one tremendous exception , that we encountered .
that was , we have since agreed , the oldest domestic structure we traversed .
were it not for the support of those flashlights soon to be made public , i would refrain from telling what i found and inferred , lest i be confined as a madman .
of course , the infinitely early parts of the patchwork tale representing the preterrestrial life of the beings on other planets , in other galaxies , and in other universes can readily be interpreted as the fantastic mythology of those beings themselves ; yet such parts sometimes involved designs and diagrams so uncannily close to the latest findings of mathematics and astrophysics that i scarcely know what to think .
let others judge when they see the photographs i shall publish .
naturally , no one set of carvings which we encountered told more than a fraction of any connected story , nor did we even begin to come upon the various stages of that story in their proper order .
some of the vast rooms were independent units so far as their designs were concerned , whilst in other cases a continuous chronicle would be carried through a series of rooms and corridors .
the best of the maps and diagrams were on the walls of a frightful abyss below even the ancient ground level a cavern perhaps two hundred feet square and sixty feet high , which had almost undoubtedly been an educational center of some sort .
there were many provoking repetitions of the same material in different rooms and buildings , since certain chapters of experience , and certain summaries or phases of racial history , had evidently been favorites with different decorators or dwellers .
sometimes , though , variant versions of the same theme proved useful in settling debatable points and filling up gaps .
i still wonder that we deduced so much in the short time at our disposal .
of course , we even now have only the barest outline and much of that was obtained later on from a study of the photographs and sketches we made .
it may be the effect of this later study the revived memories and vague impressions acting in conjunction with his general sensitiveness and with that final supposed whose essence he will not reveal even to me which has been the immediate source of danforth present breakdown .
but it had to be ; for we could not issue our warning intelligently without the fullest possible information , and the issuance of that warning is a prime necessity .
certain lingering influences in that unknown antarctic world of disordered time and alien natural law make it imperative that further exploration be discouraged .
the full story , so far as deciphered , will eventually appear in an official bulletin of miskatonic university .
here i shall sketch only the salient highlights in a formless , rambling way .
myth or otherwise , the sculptures told of the coming of those things to the nascent , lifeless earth out of cosmic space their coming , and the coming of many other alien entities such as at certain times embark upon spatial pioneering .
they seemed able to traverse the interstellar ether on their vast membranous wings thus oddly confirming some curious hill folklore long ago told me by an antiquarian colleague .
they had lived under the sea a good deal , building fantastic cities and fighting terrific battles with nameless adversaries by means of intricate devices employing unknown principles of energy .
evidently their scientific and mechanical knowledge far surpassed man today , though they made use of its more widespread and elaborate forms only when obliged to .
some of the sculptures suggested that they had passed through a stage of mechanized life on other planets , but had receded upon finding its effects emotionally unsatisfying .
their preternatural toughness of organization and simplicity of natural wants made them peculiarly able to live on a high plane without the more specialized fruits of artificial manufacture , and even without garments , except for occasional protection against the elements .
it was under the sea , at first for food and later for other purposes , that they first created earth life using available substances according to methods .
the more elaborate experiments came after the annihilation of various cosmic enemies .
they had done the same thing on other planets , having manufactured not only necessary foods , but certain multicellular protoplasmic masses capable of molding their tissues into all sorts of temporary organs under hypnotic influence and thereby forming ideal slaves to perform the heavy work of the community .
these viscous masses were without doubt what abdul alhazred whispered about as the shoggoths in his frightful necronomicon , though even that mad arab had not hinted that any existed on earth except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb .
when the old ones on this planet had synthesized their simple food forms and bred a good supply of shoggoths , they allowed other cell groups to develop into other forms of animal and vegetable life for sundry purposes , extirpating any whose presence became troublesome .
with the aid of the shoggoths , whose expansions could be made to lift prodigious weights , the small , low cities under the sea grew to vast and imposing labyrinths of stone not unlike those which later rose on land .
indeed , the highly adaptable old ones had lived much on land in other parts of the universe , and probably retained many traditions of land construction .
as we studied the architecture of all these sculptured palaeogean cities , including that whose corridors we were even then traversing , we were impressed by a curious coincidence which we have not yet tried to explain , even to ourselves .
the tops of the buildings , which in the actual city around us had , of course , been weathered into shapeless ruins ages ago , were clearly displayed in the , and showed vast clusters of spires , delicate finials on certain cone and pyramid apexes , and tiers of thin , horizontal scalloped disks capping cylindrical shafts .
this was exactly what we had seen in that monstrous and portentous mirage , cast by a dead city whence such skyline features had been absent for thousands and tens of thousands of years , which loomed on our ignorant eyes across the unfathomed mountains of madness as we first approached poor lake camp .
of the life of the old ones , both under the sea and after part of them migrated to land , volumes could be written .
those in shallow water had continued the fullest use of the eyes at the ends of their five main head tentacles , and had practiced the arts of sculpture and of writing in quite the usual way the writing accomplished with a stylus on waterproof waxen surfaces .
those lower down in the ocean depths , though they used a curious phosphorescent organism to furnish light , pieced out their vision with obscure special senses operating through the prismatic cilia on their heads senses which rendered all the old ones partly independent of light in emergencies .
their forms of sculpture and writing had changed curiously during the descent , embodying certain apparently chemical coating processes probably to secure phosphorescence which the could not make clear to us .
the beings moved in the sea partly by swimming using the lateral crinoid arms and partly by wriggling with the lower tier of tentacles containing the pseudofeet .
occasionally they accomplished long swoops with the auxiliary use of two or more sets of their fanlike folding wings .
on land they locally used the pseudofeet , but now and then flew to great heights or over long distances with their wings .
the many slender tentacles into which the crinoid arms branched were infinitely delicate , flexible , strong , and accurate in coordination ensuring the utmost skill and dexterity in all artistic and other manual operations .
the toughness of the things was almost incredible .
even the terrific pressure of the deepest sea bottoms appeared powerless to harm them .
very few seemed to die at all except by violence , and their burial places were very limited .
the fact that they covered their vertically inhumed dead with inscribed mounds set up thoughts in danforth and me which made a fresh pause and recuperation necessary after the sculptures revealed it .
the beings multiplied by means of spores like vegetable pteridophytes , as lake had suspected but , owing to their prodigious toughness and longevity , and consequent lack of replacement needs , they did not encourage the development of new prothallia except when they had new regions to colonize .
the young matured swiftly , and received an education evidently beyond any standard we can imagine .
the prevailing intellectual and aesthetic life was highly evolved , and produced a tenaciously enduring set of customs and institutions which i shall describe more fully in my coming monograph .
these varied slightly according to sea or land residence , but had the same foundations and essentials .
though able , like vegetables , to derive nourishment from inorganic substances , they vastly preferred organic and especially animal food .
they ate uncooked marine life under the sea , but cooked their viands on land .
they hunted game and raised meat herds slaughtering with sharp weapons whose odd marks on certain fossil bones our expedition had noted .
they resisted all ordinary temperatures marvelously , and in their natural state could live in water down to freezing .
when the great chill of the pleistocene drew on , however nearly a million years ago the land dwellers had to resort to special measures , including artificial heating until at last the deadly cold appears to have driven them back into the sea .
for their prehistoric flights through cosmic space , legend said , they absorbed certain chemicals and became almost independent of eating , breathing , or heat conditions but by the time of the great cold they had lost track of the method .
in any case they could not have prolonged the artificial state indefinitely without harm .
being nonpairing and semivegetable in structure , the old ones had no biological basis for the family phase of mammal life , but seemed to organize large households on the principles of comfortable and as we deduced from the pictured occupations and diversions of congenial mental association .
in furnishing their homes they kept everything in the center of the huge rooms , leaving all the wall spaces free for decorative treatment .
lighting , in the case of the land inhabitants , was accomplished by a device probably in nature .
both on land and under water they used curious tables , chairs and couches like cylindrical frames for they rested and slept upright with tentacles and racks for hinged sets of dotted surfaces forming their books .
government was evidently complex and probably socialistic , though no certainties in this regard could be deduced from the sculptures we saw .
there was extensive commerce , both local and between different cities certain small , flat counters , and inscribed , serving as money .
probably the smaller of the various greenish soapstones found by our expedition were pieces of such currency .
though the culture was mainly urban , some agriculture and much stock raising existed .
mining and a limited amount of manufacturing were also practiced .
travel was very frequent , but permanent migration seemed relatively rare except for the vast colonizing movements by which the race expanded .
for personal locomotion no external aid was used , since in land , air , and water movement alike the old ones seemed to possess excessively vast capacities for speed .
loads , however , were drawn by beasts of burden shoggoths under the sea , and a curious variety of primitive vertebrates in the later years of land existence .
these vertebrates , as well as an infinity of other life forms animal and vegetable , marine , terrestrial , and aerial were the products of unguided evolution acting on life cells made by the old ones , but escaping beyond their radius of attention .
they had been suffered to develop unchecked because they had not come in conflict with the dominant beings .
bothersome forms , of course , were mechanically exterminated .
it interested us to see in some of the very last and most decadent sculptures a shambling , primitive mammal , used sometimes for food and sometimes as an amusing buffoon by the land dwellers , whose vaguely simian and human foreshadowings were unmistakable .
in the building of land cities the huge stone blocks of the high towers were generally lifted by pterodactyls of a species heretofore unknown to paleontology .
the persistence with which the old ones survived various geologic changes and convulsions of the earth crust was little short of miraculous .
though few or none of their first cities seem to have remained beyond the archaean age , there was no interruption in their civilization or in the transmission of their records .
their original place of advent to the planet was the antarctic ocean , and it is likely that they came not long after the matter forming the moon was wrenched from the neighboring south pacific .
according to one of the sculptured maps the whole globe was then under water , with stone cities scattered farther and farther from the antarctic as aeons passed .
another map shows a vast bulk of dry land around the south pole , where it is evident that some of the beings made experimental settlements , though their main centers were transferred to the nearest sea bottom .
later maps , which display the land mass as cracking and drifting , and sending certain detached parts northward , uphold in a striking way the theories of continental drift lately advanced by taylor , wegener , and joly .
with the upheaval of new land in the south pacific tremendous events began .
some of the marine cities were hopelessly shattered , yet that was not the worst misfortune .
another race a land race of beings shaped like octopi and probably corresponding to fabulous prehuman spawn of cthulhu soon began filtering down from cosmic infinity and precipitated a monstrous war which for a time drove the old ones wholly back to the sea a colossal blow in view of the increasing land settlements .
later peace was made , and the new lands were given to the cthulhu spawn whilst the old ones held the sea and the older lands .
new land cities were founded the greatest of them in the antarctic , for this region of first arrival was sacred .
from then on , as before , the antarctic remained the center of the old ones ' civilization , and all the cities built there by the cthulhu spawn were blotted out .
then suddenly the lands of the pacific sank again , taking with them the frightful stone city of and all the cosmic octopi , so that the old ones were again supreme on the planet except for one shadowy fear about which they did not like to speak .
at a rather later age their cities dotted all the land and water areas of the globe hence the recommendation in my coming monograph that some archaeologist make systematic borings with pabodie type of apparatus in certain widely separated regions .
the steady trend down the ages was from water to land a movement encouraged by the rise of new land masses , though the ocean was never wholly deserted .
another cause of the landward movement was the new difficulty in breeding and managing the shoggoths upon which successful sea life depended .
with the march of time , as the sculptures sadly confessed , the art of creating new life from inorganic matter had been lost , so that the old ones had to depend on the molding of forms already in existence .
on land the great reptiles proved highly tractable ; but the shoggoths of the sea , reproducing by fission and acquiring a dangerous degree of accidental intelligence , presented for a time a formidable problem .
they had always been controlled through the hypnotic suggestions of the old ones , and had modeled their tough plasticity into various useful temporary limbs and organs ; but now their powers were sometimes exercised independently , and in various imitative forms implanted by past suggestion .
they had , it seems , developed a semistable brain whose separate and occasionally stubborn volition echoed the will of the old ones without always obeying it .
sculptured images of these shoggoths filled danforth and me with horror and loathing .
they were normally shapeless entities composed of a viscous jelly which looked like an agglutination of bubbles , and each averaged about fifteen feet in diameter when a sphere .
they had , however , a constantly shifting shape and volume throwing out temporary developments or forming apparent organs of sight , hearing , and speech in imitation of their masters , either spontaneously or according to suggestion .
they seem to have become peculiarly intractable toward the middle of the permian age , perhaps one hundred and fifty million years ago , when a veritable war of resubjugation was waged upon them by the marine old ones .
pictures of this war , and of the headless , fashion in which the shoggoths typically left their slain victims , held a marvelously fearsome quality despite the intervening abyss of untold ages .
the old ones had used curious weapons of molecular and atomic disturbances against the rebel entities , and in the end had achieved a complete victory .
thereafter the sculptures showed a period in which shoggoths were tamed and broken by armed old ones as the wild horses of the american west were tamed by cowboys .
though during the rebellion the shoggoths had shown an ability to live out of water , this transition was not encouraged since their usefulness on land would hardly have been commensurate with the trouble of their management .
during the jurassic age the old ones met fresh adversity in the form of a new invasion from outer space this time by , creatures creatures undoubtedly the same as those figuring in certain whispered hill legends of the north , and remembered in the himalayas as the , or abominable snow men .
to fight these beings the old ones attempted , for the first time since their terrene advent , to sally forth again into the planetary ether ; but , despite all traditional preparations , found it no longer possible to leave the earth atmosphere .
whatever the old secret of interstellar travel had been , it was now definitely lost to the race .
in the end the drove the old ones out of all the northern lands , though they were powerless to disturb those in the sea .
little by little the slow retreat of the elder race to their original antarctic habitat was beginning .
it was curious to note from the pictured battles that both the cthulhu spawn and the seem to have been composed of matter more widely different from that which we know than was the substance of the old ones .
they were able to undergo transformations and reintegrations impossible for their adversaries , and seem therefore to have originally come from even remoter gulfs of the cosmic space .
the old ones , but for their abnormal toughness and peculiar vital properties , were strictly material , and must have had their absolute origin within the known continuum whereas the first sources of the other beings can only be guessed at with bated breath .
all this , of course , assuming that the linkages and the anomalies ascribed to the invading foes are not pure mythology .
conceivably , the old ones might have invented a cosmic framework to account for their occasional defeats , since historical interest and pride obviously formed their chief psychological element .
it is significant that their annals failed to mention many advanced and potent races of beings whose mighty cultures and towering cities figure persistently in certain obscure legends .
the changing state of the world through long geologic ages appeared with startling vividness in many of the sculptured maps and scenes .
in certain cases existing science will require revision , while in other cases its bold deductions are magnificently confirmed .
as i have said , the hypothesis of taylor , wegener , and joly that all the continents are fragments of an original antarctic land mass which cracked from centrifugal force and drifted apart over a technically viscous lower surface an hypothesis suggested by such things as the complementary outlines of africa and south america , and the way the great mountain chains are rolled and shoved up receives striking support from this uncanny source .
maps evidently showing the carboniferous world of an hundred million or more years ago displayed significant rifts and chasms destined later to separate africa from the once continuous realms of europe ( then the valusia of primal legend ) , asia , the americas , and the antarctic continent .
other charts and most significantly one in connection with the founding fifty million years ago of the vast dead city around us showed all the present continents well differentiated .
and in the latest discoverable specimen dating perhaps from the pliocene age the approximate world of today appeared quite clearly despite the linkage of alaska with siberia , of north america with europe through greenland , and of south america with the antarctic continent through graham land .
in the carboniferous map the whole floor and rifted land mass alike bore symbols of the old ones ' vast stone cities , but in the later charts the gradual recession toward the antarctic became very plain .
the final pliocene specimen showed no land cities except on the antarctic continent and the tip of south america , nor any ocean cities north of the fiftieth parallel of south latitude .
knowledge and interest in the northern world , save for a study of coast lines probably made during long exploration flights on those fanlike membranous wings , had evidently declined to zero among the old ones .
destruction of cities through the upthrust of mountains , the centrifugal rending of continents , the seismic convulsions of land or sea bottom , and other natural causes , was a matter of common record ; and it was curious to observe how fewer and fewer replacements were made as the ages wore on .
the vast dead megalopolis that yawned around us seemed to be the last general center of the race built early in the cretaceous age after a titanic earth buckling had obliterated a still vaster predecessor not far distant .
it appeared that this general region was the most sacred spot of all , where reputedly the first old ones had settled on a primal sea bottom .
in the new city many of whose features we could recognize in the sculptures , but which stretched fully a hundred miles along the mountain range in each direction beyond the farthest limits of our aerial survey there were reputed to be preserved certain sacred stones forming part of the first city , which thrust up to light after long epochs in the course of the general crumbling of strata .
naturally , danforth and i studied with especial interest and a peculiarly personal sense of awe everything pertaining to the immediate district in which we were .
of this local material there was naturally a vast abundance ; and on the tangled ground level of the city we were lucky enough to find a house of very late date whose walls , though somewhat damaged by a neighboring rift , contained sculptures of decadent workmanship carrying the story of the region much beyond the period of the pliocene map whence we derived our last general glimpse of the prehuman world .
this was the last place we examined in detail , since what we found there gave us a fresh immediate objective .
certainly , we were in one of the strangest , weirdest , and most terrible of all the corners of earth globe .
of all existing lands , it was infinitely the most ancient .
the conviction grew upon us that this hideous upland must indeed be the fabled nightmare plateau of leng which even the mad author of the necronomicon was reluctant to discuss .
the great mountain chain was tremendously long starting as a low range at luitpold land on the east coast of weddell sea and virtually crossing the entire continent .
that really high part stretched in a mighty arc from about latitude , longitude to latitude , longitude , with its concave side toward our camp and its seaward end in the region of that long , coast whose hills were glimpsed by wilkes and mawson at the antarctic circle .
yet even more monstrous exaggerations of nature seemed disturbingly close at hand .
i have said that these peaks are higher than the himalayas , but the sculptures forbid me to say that they are earth highest .
that grim honor is beyond doubt reserved for something which half the sculptures hesitated to record at all , whilst others approached it with obvious repugnance and trepidation .
it seems that there was one part of the ancient land the first part that ever rose from the waters after the earth had flung off the moon and the old ones had seeped down , from the stars which had come to be shunned as vaguely and namelessly evil .
cities built there had crumbled before their time , and had been found suddenly deserted .
then when the first great earth buckling had convulsed the region in the comanchian age , a frightful line of peaks had shot suddenly up amidst the most appalling din and chaos and earth had received her loftiest and most terrible mountains .
if the scale of the carvings was correct , these abhorred things must have been much over forty thousand feet high radically vaster than even the shocking mountains of madness we had crossed .
they extended , it appeared , from about latitude , longitude to latitude , longitude less than three hundred miles away from the dead city , so that we would have spied their dreaded summits in the dim western distance had it not been for that vague , opalescent haze .
their northern end must likewise be visible from the long antarctic circle coast line at queen mary land .
some of the old ones , in the decadent days , had made strange prayers to those mountains but none ever went near them or dared to guess what lay beyond .
no human eye had ever seen them , and as i studied the emotions conveyed in the carvings , i prayed that none ever might .
there are protecting hills along the coast beyond them queen mary and kaiser wilhelm lands and i thank heaven no one has been able to land and climb those hills .
i am not as sceptical about old tales and fears as i used to be , and i do not laugh now at the prehuman sculptor notion that lightning paused meaningfully now and then at each of the brooding crests , and that an unexplained glow shone from one of those terrible pinnacles all through the long polar night .
there may be a very real and very monstrous meaning in the old pnakotic whispers about kadath in the cold waste .
but the terrain close at hand was hardly less strange , even if less namelessly accursed .
soon after the founding of the city the great mountain range became the seat of the principal temples , and many carvings showed what grotesque and fantastic towers had pierced the sky where now we saw only the curiously clinging cubes and ramparts .
in the course of ages the caves had appeared , and had been shaped into adjuncts of the temples .
with the advance of still later epochs , all the limestone veins of the region were hollowed out by ground waters , so that the mountains , the foothills , and the plains below them were a veritable network of connected caverns and galleries .
many graphic sculptures told of explorations deep underground , and of the final discovery of the stygian sunless sea that lurked at earth bowels .
this vast nighted gulf had undoubtedly been worn by the great river which flowed down from the nameless and horrible westward mountains , and which had formerly turned at the base of the old ones ' range and flowed beside that chain into the indian ocean between budd and totten lands on wilkes coast line .
little by little it had eaten away the limestone hill base at its turning , till at last its sapping currents reached the caverns of the ground waters and joined with them in digging a deeper abyss .
finally its whole bulk emptied into the hollow hills and left the old bed toward the ocean dry .
much of the later city as we now found it had been built over that former bed .
the old ones , understanding what had happened , and exercising their always keen artistic sense , had carved into ornate pylons those headlands of the foothills where the great stream began its descent into eternal darkness .
this river , once crossed by scores of noble stone bridges , was plainly the one whose extinct course we had seen in our aeroplane survey .
its position in different carvings of the city helped us to orient ourselves to the scene as it had been at various stages of the region , history , so that we were able to sketch a hasty but careful map of the salient features squares , important buildings , and the like for guidance in further explorations .
we could soon reconstruct in fancy the whole stupendous thing as it was a million or ten million or fifty million years ago , for the sculptures told us exactly what the buildings and mountains and squares and suburbs and landscape setting and luxuriant tertiary vegetation had looked like .
it must have had a marvelous and mystic beauty , and as i thought of it , i almost forgot the clammy sense of sinister oppression with which the city inhuman age and massiveness and deadness and remoteness and glacial twilight had choked and weighed on my spirit .
yet according to certain carvings , the denizens of that city had themselves known the clutch of oppressive terror ; for there was a somber and recurrent type of scene in which the old ones were shown in the act of recoiling affrightedly from some object never allowed to appear in the design found in the great river and indicated as having been washed down through waving , cycad forests from those horrible westward mountains .
it was only in the one house with the decadent carvings that we obtained any foreshadowing of the final calamity leading to the city desertion .
undoubtedly there must have been many sculptures of the same age elsewhere , even allowing for the slackened energies and aspirations of a stressful and uncertain period ; indeed , very certain evidence of the existence of others came to us shortly afterward .
but this was the first and only set we directly encountered .
we meant to look farther later on ; but as i have said , immediate conditions dictated another present objective .
there would , though , have been a limit for after all hope of a long future occupancy of the place had perished among the old ones , there could not but have been a complete cessation of mural decoration .
the ultimate blow , of course , was the coming of the great cold which once held most of the earth in thrall , and which has never departed from the poles the great cold that , at the world other extremity , put an end to the fabled lands of lomar and hyperborea .
just when this tendency began in the antarctic , it would be hard to say in terms of exact years .
nowadays we set the beginning of the general glacial periods at a distance of about five hundred thousand years from the present , but at the poles the terrible scourge must have commenced much earlier .
all quantitative estimates are partly guesswork , but it is quite likely that the decadent sculptures were made considerably less than a million years ago , and that the actual desertion of the city was complete long before the conventional opening of the pleistocene five hundred thousand years ago as reckoned in terms of the earth whole surface .
in the decadent sculptures there were signs of thinner vegetation everywhere , and of a decreased country life on the part of the old ones .
heating devices were shown in the houses , and winter travelers were represented as muffled in protective fabrics .
then we saw a series of cartouches the continuous band arrangement being frequently interrupted in these late carvings depicting a constantly growing migration to the nearest refuges of greater warmth some fleeing to cities under the sea off the coast , and some clambering down through networks of limestone caverns in the hollow hills to the neighboring black abyss of subterrene waters .
in the end it seems to have been the neighboring abyss which received the greatest colonization .
this was partly due , no doubt , to the traditional sacredness of this special region , but may have been more conclusively determined by the opportunities it gave for continuing the use of the great temples on the honeycombed mountains , and for retaining the vast land city as a place of summer residence and base of communication with various mines .
the linkage of old and new abodes was made more effective by means of several gradings and improvements along the connecting routes , including the chiseling of numerous direct tunnels from the ancient metropolis to the black abyss sharply tunnels whose mouths we carefully drew , according to our most thoughtful estimates , on the guide map we were compiling .
it was obvious that at least two of these tunnels lay within a reasonable exploring distance of where we were both being on the mountainward edge of the city , one less than a quarter of a mile toward the ancient river course , and the other perhaps twice that distance in the opposite direction .
the abyss , it seems , had shelving shores of dry land at certain places , but the old ones built their new city under water no doubt because of its greater certainty of uniform warmth .
the depth of the hidden sea appears to have been very great , so that the earth internal heat could ensure its habitability for an indefinite period .
the beings seemed to have had no trouble in adapting themselves to and eventually , of course , residence under water , since they had never allowed their gill systems to atrophy .
there were many sculptures which showed how they had always frequently visited their submarine kinsfolk elsewhere , and how they had habitually bathed on the deep bottom of their great river .
the darkness of inner earth could likewise have been no deterrent to a race accustomed to long antarctic nights .
decadent though their style undoubtedly was , these latest carvings had a truly epic quality where they told of the building of the new city in the cavern sea .
the old ones had gone about it scientifically quarrying insoluble rocks from the heart of the honeycombed mountains , and employing expert workers from the nearest submarine city to perform the construction according to the best methods .
these workers brought with them all that was necessary to establish the new venture shoggoth tissue from which to breed stone lifters and subsequent beasts of burden for the cavern city , and other protoplasmic matter to mold into phosphorescent organisms for lighting purposes .
at last a mighty metropolis rose on the bottom of that stygian sea , its architecture much like that of the city above , and its workmanship displaying relatively little decadence because of the precise mathematical element inherent in building operations .
the newly bred shoggoths grew to enormous size and singular intelligence , and were represented as taking and executing orders with marvelous quickness .
they seemed to converse with the old ones by mimicking their voices a sort of musical piping over a wide range , if poor lake dissection had indicated aright and to work more from spoken commands than from hypnotic suggestions as in earlier times .
they were , however , kept in admirable control .
the phosphorescent organisms supplied light with vast effectiveness , and doubtless atoned for the loss of the familiar polar auroras of the night .
art and decoration were pursued , though of course with a certain decadence .
the old ones seemed to realize this falling off themselves , and in many cases anticipated the policy of constantine the great by transplanting especially fine blocks of ancient carving from their land city , just as the emperor , in a similar age of decline , stripped greece and asia of their finest art to give his new byzantine capital greater splendors than its own people could create .
that the transfer of sculptured blocks had not been more extensive was doubtless owing to the fact that the land city was not at first wholly abandoned .
by the time total abandonment did occur and it surely must have occurred before the polar pleistocene was far advanced the old ones had perhaps become satisfied with their decadent art or had ceased to recognize the superior merit of the older carvings .
at any rate , the ruins around us had certainly undergone no wholesale sculptural denudation , though all the best separate statues , like other movables , had been taken away .
the decadent cartouches and dadoes telling this story were , as i have said , the latest we could find in our limited search .
they left us with a picture of the old ones shuttling back and forth betwixt the land city in summer and the city in winter , and sometimes trading with the cities off the antarctic coast .
by this time the ultimate doom of the land city must have been recognized , for the sculptures showed many signs of the cold malign encroachments .
vegetation was declining , and the terrible snows of the winter no longer melted completely even in midsummer .
the saurian livestock were nearly all dead , and the mammals were standing it none too well .
to keep on with the work of the upper world it had become necessary to adapt some of the amorphous and curiously shoggoths to land life a thing the old ones had formerly been reluctant to do .
the great river was now lifeless , and the upper sea had lost most of its denizens except the seals and whales .
all the birds had flown away , save only the great , grotesque penguins .
what had happened afterward we could only guess .
how long had the new city survived ?
was it still down there , a stony corpse in eternal blackness ?
had the subterranean waters frozen at last ?
to what fate had the cities of the outer world been delivered ?
had any of the old ones shifted north ahead of the creeping ice cap ?
existing geology shows no trace of their presence .
had the frightful been still a menace in the outer land world of the north ?
could one be sure of what might or might not linger , even to this day , in the lightless and unplumbed abysses of earth deepest waters ?
those things had seemingly been able to withstand any amount of pressure and men of the sea have fished up curious objects at times .
and has the theory really explained the savage and mysterious scars on antarctic seals noticed a generation ago by borchgrevingk ?
the specimens found by poor lake did not enter into these guesses , for their geologic setting proved them to have lived at what must have been a very early date in the land city history .
they were , according to their location , certainly not less than thirty million years old , and we reflected that in their day the city , and indeed the cavern itself , had had no existence .
they would have remembered an older scene , with lush tertiary vegetation everywhere , a younger land city of flourishing arts around them , and a great river sweeping northward along the base of the mighty mountains toward a tropic ocean .
and yet we could not help thinking about these specimens especially about the eight perfect ones that were missing from lake hideously ravaged camp .
there was something abnormal about that whole business the strange things we had tried so hard to lay to somebody madness those frightful graves the amount and nature of the missing material gedney the unearthly toughness of those archaic monstrosities , and the queer vital freaks the sculptures now showed the race to have danforth and i had seen a good deal in the last few hours , and were prepared to believe and keep silent about many appalling and incredible secrets of primal nature .
i have said that our study of the decadent sculptures brought about a change in our immediate objective .
this , of course , had to do with the chiseled avenues to the black inner world , of whose existence we had not known before , but which we were now eager to find and traverse .
from the evident scale of the carvings we deduced that a steeply descending walk of about a mile through either of the neighboring tunnels would bring us to the brink of the dizzy , sunless cliffs about the great abyss ; down whose sides paths , improved by the old ones , led to the rocky shore of the hidden and nighted ocean .
to behold this fabulous gulf in stark reality was a lure which seemed impossible of resistance once we knew of the thing yet we realized we must begin the quest at once if we expected to include it in our present trip .
it was now , and we did not have enough battery replacements to let our torches burn on forever .
we had done so much studying and copying below the glacial level that our battery supply had had at least five hours of nearly continuous use , and despite the special dry cell formula , would obviously be good for only about four more though by keeping one torch unused , except for especially interesting or difficult places , we might manage to eke out a safe margin beyond that .
it would not do to be without a light in these cyclopean catacombs , hence in order to make the abyss trip we must give up all further mural deciphering .
of course we intended to revisit the place for days and perhaps weeks of intensive study and photography curiosity having long ago got the better of horror but just now we must hasten .
our supply of paper was far from unlimited , and we were reluctant to sacrifice spare notebooks or sketching paper to augment it , but we did let one large notebook go .
if worse came to worst we could resort to rock chipping and of course it would be possible , even in case of really lost direction , to work up to full daylight by one channel or another if granted sufficient time for plentiful trial and error .
so at last we set off eagerly in the indicated direction of the nearest tunnel .
according to the carvings from which we had made our map , the desired tunnel mouth could not be much more than a quarter of a mile from where we stood ; the intervening space showing buildings quite likely to be penetrable still at a level .
the opening itself would be in the basement on the angle nearest the foothills of a vast structure of evidently public and perhaps ceremonial nature , which we tried to identify from our aerial survey of the ruins .
no such structure came to our minds as we recalled our flight , hence we concluded that its upper parts had been greatly damaged , or that it had been totally shattered in an ice rift we had noticed .
in the latter case the tunnel would probably turn out to be choked , so that we would have to try the next nearest one the one less than a mile to the north .
the intervening river course prevented our trying any of the more southern tunnels on this trip ; and indeed , if both of the neighboring ones were choked it was doubtful whether our batteries would warrant an attempt on the next northerly one about a mile beyond our second choice .
as we threaded our dim way through the labyrinth with the aid of map and compass traversing rooms and corridors in every stage of ruin or preservation , clambering up ramps , crossing upper floors and bridges and clambering down again , encountering choked doorways and piles of debris , hastening now and then along finely preserved and uncannily immaculate stretches , taking false leads and retracing our way ( in such cases removing the blind paper trail we had left ) , and once in a while striking the bottom of an open shaft through which daylight poured or trickled down we were repeatedly tantalized by the sculptured walls along our route .
many must have told tales of immense historical importance , and only the prospect of later visits reconciled us to the need of passing them by .
as it was , we slowed down once in a while and turned on our second torch .
if we had had more films , we would certainly have paused briefly to photograph certain , but was clearly out of the question .
i come now once more to a place where the temptation to hesitate , or to hint rather than state , is very strong .
it is necessary , however , to reveal the rest in order to justify my course in discouraging further exploration .
we had wormed our way very close to the computed site of the tunnel mouth having crossed a bridge to what seemed plainly the tip of a pointed wall , and descended to a ruinous corridor especially rich in decadently elaborate and apparently ritualistic sculptures of late workmanship when , shortly before , danforth keen young nostrils gave us the first hint of something unusual .
if we had had a dog with us , i suppose we would have been warned before .
at first we could not precisely say what was wrong with the formerly air , but after a few seconds our memories reacted only too definitely .
let me try to state the thing without flinching .
there was an odor and that odor was vaguely , subtly , and unmistakably akin to what had nauseated us upon opening the insane grave of the horror poor lake had dissected .
of course the revelation was not as clearly cut at the time as it sounds now .
there were several conceivable explanations , and we did a good deal of indecisive whispering .
most important of all , we did not retreat without further investigation ; for having come this far , we were loath to be balked by anything short of certain disaster .
anyway , what we must have suspected was altogether too wild to believe .
such things did not happen in any normal world .
it was probably sheer irrational instinct which made us dim our single torch tempted no longer by the decadent and sinister sculptures that leered menacingly from the oppressive walls and which softened our progress to a cautious tiptoeing and crawling over the increasingly littered floor and heaps of debris .
danforth eyes as well as nose proved better than mine , for it was likewise he who first noticed the queer aspect of the debris after we had passed many arches leading to chambers and corridors on the ground level .
it did not look quite as it ought after countless thousands of years of desertion , and when we cautiously turned on more light we saw that a kind of swath seemed to have been lately tracked through it .
the irregular nature of the litter precluded any definite marks , but in the smoother places there were suggestions of the dragging of heavy objects .
once we thought there was a hint of parallel tracks as if of runners .
this was what made us pause again .
it was during that pause that we caught simultaneously this time the other odor ahead .
paradoxically , it was both a less frightful and more frightful odor less frightful intrinsically , but infinitely appalling in this place under the known circumstances unless , of course , gedney for the odor was the plain and familiar one of common petrol gasoline .
our motivation after that is something i will leave to psychologists .
we knew now that some terrible extension of the camp horrors must have crawled into this nighted burial place of the aeons , hence could not doubt any longer the existence of nameless conditions present or at least recent just ahead .
yet in the end we did let sheer burning curiosity or anxiety or autohypnotism or vague thoughts of responsibility toward gedney or what not drive us on .
danforth whispered again of the print he thought he had seen at the alley turning in the ruins above ; and of the faint musical piping potentially of tremendous significance in the light of lake dissection report , despite its close resemblance to the echoes of the windy peaks which he thought he had shortly afterward half heard from unknown depths below .
i , in my turn , whispered of how the camp was left of what had disappeared , and of how the madness of a lone survivor might have conceived the inconceivable a wild trip across the monstrous mountains and a descent into the unknown , primal masonry .
but we could not convince each other , or even ourselves , of anything definite .
we had turned off all light as we stood still , and vaguely noticed that a trace of deeply filtered upper day kept the blackness from being absolute .
having automatically begun to move ahead , we guided ourselves by occasional flashes from our torch .
the disturbed debris formed an impression we could not shake off , and the smell of gasoline grew stronger .
more and more ruin met our eyes and hampered our feet , until very soon we saw that the forward way was about to cease .
we had been all too correct in our pessimistic guess about that rift glimpsed from the air .
our tunnel quest was a blind one , and we were not even going to be able to reach the basement out of which the abyssward aperture opened .
the torch , flashing over the grotesquely carved walls of the blocked corridor in which we stood , showed several doorways in various states of obstruction ; and from one of them the gasoline odor quite submerging that other hint of odor came with especial distinctness .
as we looked more steadily , we saw that beyond a doubt there had been a slight and recent clearing away of debris from that particular opening .
whatever the lurking horror might be , we believed the direct avenue toward it was now plainly manifest .
i do not think anyone will wonder that we waited an appreciable time before making any further motion .
and yet , when we did venture inside that black arch , our first impression was one of anticlimax .
for amidst the littered expanse of that sculptured crypt a perfect cube with sides of about twenty feet there remained no recent object of instantly discernible size ; so that we looked instinctively , though in vain , for a farther doorway .
in another moment , however , danforth sharp vision had descried a place where the floor debris had been disturbed ; and we turned on both torches full strength .
though what we saw in that light was actually simple and trifling , i am none the less reluctant to tell of it because of what it implied .
it was a rough leveling of the debris , upon which several small objects lay carelessly scattered , and at one corner of which a considerable amount of gasoline must have been spilled lately enough to leave a strong odor even at this extreme superplateau altitude .
in other words , it could not be other than a sort of camp a camp made by questing beings who , like us , had been turned back by the unexpectedly choked way to the abyss .
let me be plain .
the scattered objects were , so far as substance was concerned , all from lake camp ; and consisted of tin cans as queerly opened as those we had seen at that ravaged place , many spent matches , three illustrated books more or less curiously smudged , an empty ink bottle with its pictorial and instructional carton , a broken fountain pen , some oddly snipped fragments of fur and tent cloth , a used electric battery with circular of directions , a folder that came with our type of tent heater , and a sprinkling of crumpled papers .
it was all bad enough but when we smoothed out the papers and looked at what was on them , we felt we had come to the worst .
we had found certain inexplicably blotted papers at the camp which might have prepared us , yet the effect of the sight down there in the prehuman vaults of a nightmare city was almost too much to bear .
a mad gedney might have made the groups of dots in imitation of those found on the greenish soapstones , just as the dots on those insane grave mounds might have been made ; and he might conceivably have prepared rough , hasty sketches varying in their accuracy or lack of it which outlined the neighboring parts of the city and traced the way from a circularly represented place outside our previous route a place we identified as a great cylindrical tower in the carvings and as a vast circular gulf glimpsed in our aerial survey to the present structure and the tunnel mouth therein .
he might , i repeat , have prepared such sketches ; for those before us were quite obviously compiled , as our own had been , from late sculptures somewhere in the glacial labyrinth , though not from the ones which we had seen and used .
but what the bungler could never have done was to execute those sketches in a strange and assured technique perhaps superior , despite haste and carelessness , to any of the decadent carvings from which they were taken the characteristic and unmistakable technique of the old ones themselves in the dead city heyday .
there are those who will say danforth and i were utterly mad not to flee for our lives after that ; since our conclusions were now notwithstanding their wildness completely fixed , and of a nature i need not even mention to those who have read my account as far as this .
perhaps we were mad for have i not said those horrible peaks were mountains of madness ?
but i think i can detect something of the same spirit albeit in a less extreme form in the men who stalk deadly beasts through african jungles to photograph them or study their habits .
half paralyzed with terror though we were , there was nevertheless fanned within us a blazing flame of awe and curiosity which triumphed in the end .
of course we did not mean to face that or those which we knew had been there , but we felt that they must be gone by now .
they would by this time have found the other neighboring entrance to the abyss , and have passed within , to whatever fragments of the past might await them in the ultimate gulf the ultimate gulf they had never seen .
or if that entrance , too , was blocked , they would have gone on to the north seeking another .
they were , we remembered , partly independent of light .
looking back to that moment , i can scarcely recall just what precise form our new emotions took just what change of immediate objective it was that so sharpened our sense of expectancy .
we certainly did not mean to face what we feared yet i will not deny that we may have had a lurking , unconscious wish to spy certain things from some hidden vantage point .
probably we had not given up our zeal to glimpse the abyss itself , though there was interposed a new goal in the form of that great circular place shown on the crumpled sketches we had found .
we had at once recognized it as a monstrous cylindrical tower figuring in the very earliest carvings , but appearing only as a prodigious round aperture from above .
something about the impressiveness of its rendering , even in these hasty diagrams , made us think that its subglacial levels must still form a feature of peculiar importance .
perhaps it embodied architectural marvels as yet unencountered by us .
it was certainly of incredible age according to the sculptures in which it figured being indeed among the first things built in the city .
its carvings , if preserved , could not but be highly significant .
moreover , it might form a good present link with the upper world a shorter route than the one we were so carefully blazing , and probably that by which those others had descended .
at any rate , the thing we did was to study the terrible sketches which quite perfectly confirmed our own and start back over the indicated course to the circular place ; the course which our nameless predecessors must have traversed twice before us .
the other neighboring gate to the abyss would lie beyond that .
i need not speak of our journey during which we continued to leave an economical trail of paper for it was precisely the same in kind as that by which we had reached the ; except that it tended to adhere more closely to the ground level and even descend to basement corridors .
every now and then we could trace certain disturbing marks in the debris or litter underfoot ; and after we had passed outside the radius of the gasoline scent , we were again faintly conscious spasmodically of that more hideous and more persistent scent .
after the way had branched from our former course , we sometimes gave the rays of our single torch a furtive sweep along the walls ; noting in almost every case the omnipresent sculptures , which indeed seem to have formed a main aesthetic outlet for the old ones .
about , while traversing a long , vaulted corridor whose increasingly glaciated floor seemed somewhat below the ground level and whose roof grew lower as we advanced , we began to see strong daylight ahead and were able to turn off our torch .
it appeared that we were coming to the vast circular place , and that our distance from the upper air could not be very great .
the corridor ended in an arch surprisingly low for these megalithic ruins , but we could see much through it even before we emerged .
beyond there stretched a prodigious round space fully two hundred feet in diameter strewn with debris and containing many choked archways corresponding to the one we were about to cross .
the walls were in available spaces boldly sculptured into a spiral band of heroic proportions ; and displayed , despite the destructive weathering caused by the openness of the spot , an artistic splendor far beyond anything we had encountered before .
the littered floor was quite heavily glaciated , and we fancied that the true bottom lay at a considerably lower depth .
but the salient object of the place was the titanic stone ramp which , eluding the archways by a sharp turn outward into the open floor , wound spirally up the stupendous cylindrical wall like an inside counterpart of those once climbing outside the monstrous towers or ziggurats of antique babylon .
only the rapidity of our flight , and the perspective which confounded the descent with the tower inner wall , had prevented our noticing this feature from the air , and thus caused us to seek another avenue to the subglacial level .
pabodie might have been able to tell what sort of engineering held it in place , but danforth and i could merely admire and marvel .
we could see mighty stone corbels and pillars here and there , but what we saw seemed inadequate to the function performed .
the thing was excellently preserved up to the present top of the tower a highly remarkable circumstance in view of its exposure and its shelter had done much to protect the bizarre and disturbing cosmic sculptures on the walls .
as we stepped out into the awesome half daylight of this monstrous cylinder bottom fifty million years old , and without doubt the most primally ancient structure ever to meet our eyes we saw that the sides stretched dizzily up to a height of fully sixty feet .
this , we recalled from our aerial survey , meant an outside glaciation of some forty feet ; since the yawning gulf we had seen from the plane had been at the top of an approximately mound of crumbled masonry , somewhat sheltered for of its circumference by the massive curving walls of a line of higher ruins .
according to the sculptures , the original tower had stood in the center of an immense circular plaza , and had been perhaps five hundred or six hundred feet high , with tiers of horizontal disks near the top , and a row of needlelike spires along the upper rim .
most of the masonry had obviously toppled outward rather than inward a fortunate happening , since otherwise the ramp might have been shattered and the whole interior choked .
as it was , the ramp showed sad battering ; whilst the choking was such that all the archways at the bottom seemed to have been recently cleared .
it took us only a moment to conclude that this was indeed the route by which those others had descended , and that this would be the logical route for our own ascent despite the long trail of paper we had left elsewhere .
the tower mouth was no farther from the foothills and our waiting plane than was the great terraced building we had entered , and any further subglacial exploration we might make on this trip would lie in this general region .
oddly , we were still thinking about possible later trips even after all we had seen and guessed .
then , as we picked our way cautiously over the debris of the great floor , there came a sight which for the time excluded all other matters .
it was the neatly huddled array of three sledges in that farther angle of the ramp lower and course which had hitherto been screened from our view .
there they were the three sledges missing from lake camp shaken by a hard usage which must have included forcible dragging along great reaches of snowless masonry and debris , as well as much hand portage over utterly unnavigable places .
they were carefully and intelligently packed and strapped , and contained things memorably familiar enough the gasoline stove , fuel cans , instrument cases , provision tins , tarpaulins obviously bulging with books , and some bulging with less obvious contents everything derived from lake equipment .
after what we had found in that other room , we were in a measure prepared for this encounter .
the really great shock came when we stepped over and undid one tarpaulin whose outlines had peculiarly disquieted us .
it seems that others as well as lake had been interested in collecting typical specimens ; for there were two here , both stiffly frozen , perfectly preserved , patched with adhesive plaster where some wounds around the neck had occurred , and wrapped with care to prevent further damage .
they were the bodies of young gedney and the missing dog .
x many people will probably judge us callous as well as mad for thinking about the northward tunnel and the abyss so soon after our somber discovery , and i am not prepared to say that we would have immediately revived such thoughts but for a specific circumstance which broke in upon us and set up a whole new train of speculations .
we had replaced the tarpaulin over poor gedney and were standing in a kind of mute bewilderment when the sounds finally reached our consciousness the first sounds we had heard since descending out of the open where the mountain wind whined faintly from its unearthly heights .
and mundane though they were , their presence in this remote world of death was more unexpected and unnerving than any grotesque or fabulous tones could possibly have been since they gave a fresh upsetting to all our notions of cosmic harmony .
had it been some trace of that bizarre musical piping over a wide range which lake dissection report had led us to expect in those others and which , indeed , our overwrought fancies had been reading into every wind howl we had heard since coming on the camp horror it would have had a kind of hellish congruity with the region around us .
a voice from other epochs belongs in a graveyard of other epochs .
as it was , however , the noise shattered all our profoundly seated adjustments all our tacit acceptance of the inner antarctic as a waste utterly and irrevocably void of every vestige of normal life .
what we heard was not the fabulous note of any buried blasphemy of elder earth from whose supernal toughness an polar sun had evoked a monstrous response .
instead , it was a thing so mockingly normal and so unerringly familiarized by our sea days off victoria land and our camp days at mcmurdo sound that we shuddered to think of it here , where such things ought not to be .
to be brief it was simply the raucous squawking of a penguin .
the muffled sound floated from subglacial recesses nearly opposite to the corridor whence we had come regions manifestly in the direction of that other tunnel to the vast abyss .
the presence of a living water bird in such a direction in a world whose surface was one of and uniform lifelessness could lead to only one conclusion ; hence our first thought was to verify the objective reality of the sound .
it was , indeed , repeated , and seemed at times to come from more than one throat .
seeking its source , we entered an archway from which much debris had been cleared ; resuming our trail blazing with an added paper supply taken with curious repugnance from one of the tarpaulin bundles on the sledges when we left daylight behind .
as the glaciated floor gave place to a litter of detritus , we plainly discerned some curious , dragging tracks ; and once danforth found a distinct print of a sort whose description would be only too superfluous .
the course indicated by the penguin cries was precisely what our map and compass prescribed as an approach to the more northerly tunnel mouth , and we were glad to find that a bridgeless thoroughfare on the ground and basement levels seemed open .
the tunnel , according to the chart , ought to start from the basement of a large pyramidal structure which we seemed vaguely to recall from our aerial survey as remarkably .
along our path the single torch showed a customary profusion of carvings , but we did not pause to examine any of these .
suddenly a bulky white shape loomed up ahead of us , and we flashed on the second torch .
it is odd how wholly this new quest had turned our minds from earlier fears of what might lurk near .
those other ones , having left their supplies in the great circular place , must have planned to return after their scouting trip toward or into the abyss ; yet we had now discarded all caution concerning them as completely as if they had never existed .
this white , waddling thing was fully six feet high , yet we seemed to realize at once that it was not one of those others .
they were larger and dark , and , according to the sculptures , their motion over land surfaces was a swift , assured matter despite the queerness of their tentacle equipment .
but to say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain .
we were indeed clutched for an instant by primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others .
then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones .
for it was only a penguin albeit of a huge , unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins , and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness .
when we had followed the thing into the archway and turned both our torches on the indifferent and unheeding group of three , we saw that they were all eyeless albinos of the same unknown and gigantic species .
their size reminded us of some of the archaic penguins depicted in the old ones ' sculptures , and it did not take us long to conclude that they were descended from the same stock undoubtedly surviving through a retreat to some warmer inner region whose perpetual blackness had destroyed their pigmentation and atrophied their eyes to mere useless slits .
that their present habitat was the vast abyss we sought , was not for a moment to be doubted ; and this evidence of the gulf continued warmth and habitability filled us with the most curious and subtly perturbing fancies .
we wondered , too , what had caused these three birds to venture out of their usual domain .
the state and silence of the great dead city made it clear that it had at no time been an habitual seasonal rookery , whilst the manifest indifference of the trio to our presence made it seem odd that any passing party of those others should have startled them .
was it possible that those others had taken some aggressive action or tried to increase their meat supply ?
we doubted whether that pungent odor which the dogs had hated could cause an equal antipathy in these penguins , since their ancestors had obviously lived on excellent terms with the old ones an amicable relationship which must have survived in the abyss below as long as any of the old ones remained .
regretting in a of the old spirit of pure science that we could not photograph these anomalous creatures , we shortly left them to their squawking and pushed on toward the abyss whose openness was now so positively proved to us , and whose exact direction occasional penguin tracks made clear .
not long afterward a steep descent in a long , low , doorless , and peculiarly sculptureless corridor led us to believe that we were approaching the tunnel mouth at last .
we had passed two more penguins , and heard others immediately ahead .
then the corridor ended in a prodigious open space which made us gasp involuntarily a perfect inverted hemisphere , obviously deep underground ; fully a hundred feet in diameter and fifty feet high , with low archways opening around all parts of the circumference but one , and that one yawning cavernously with a black , arched aperture which broke the symmetry of the vault to a height of nearly fifteen feet .
it was the entrance to the great abyss .
in this vast hemisphere , whose concave roof was impressively though decadently carved to a likeness of the primordial celestial dome , a few albino penguins waddled aliens there , but indifferent and unseeing .
the black tunnel yawned indefinitely off at a steep , descending grade , its aperture adorned with grotesquely chiseled jambs and lintel .
from that cryptical mouth we fancied a current of slightly warmer air , and perhaps even a suspicion of vapor proceeded ; and we wondered what living entities other than penguins the limitless void below , and the contiguous honeycombings of the land and the titan mountains , might conceal .
we wondered , too , whether the trace of mountaintop smoke at first suspected by poor lake , as well as the odd haze we had ourselves perceived around the peak , might not be caused by the rising of some such vapor from the unfathomed regions of earth core .
entering the tunnel , we saw that its outline was at least at the start about fifteen feet each way sides , floor , and arched roof composed of the usual megalithic masonry .
the sides were sparsely decorated with cartouches of conventional designs in a late , decadent style ; and all the construction and carving were marvelously .
the floor was quite clear , except for a slight detritus bearing outgoing penguin tracks and the inward tracks of these others .
the farther one advanced , the warmer it became ; so that we were soon unbuttoning our heavy garments .
we wondered whether there were any actually igneous manifestations below , and whether the waters of that sunless sea were hot .
after a short distance the masonry gave place to solid rock , though the tunnel kept the same proportions and presented the same aspect of carved regularity .
occasionally its varying grade became so steep that grooves were cut in the floor .
several times we noted the mouths of small lateral galleries not recorded in our diagrams ; none of them such as to complicate the problem of our return , and all of them welcome as possible refuges in case we met unwelcome entities on their way back from the abyss .
the nameless scent of such things was very distinct .
doubtless it was suicidally foolish to venture into that tunnel under the known conditions , but the lure of the unplumbed is stronger in certain persons than most suspect indeed , it was just such a lure which had brought us to this unearthly polar waste in the first place .
we saw several penguins as we passed along , and speculated on the distance we would have to traverse .
the carvings had led us to expect a steep downhill walk of about a mile to the abyss , but our previous wanderings had shown us that matters of scale were not wholly to be depended on .
after about a quarter of a mile that nameless scent became greatly accentuated , and we kept very careful track of the various lateral openings we passed .
there was no visible vapor as at the mouth , but this was doubtless due to the lack of contrasting cooler air .
the temperature was rapidly ascending , and we were not surprised to come upon a careless heap of material shudderingly familiar to us .
it was composed of furs and tent cloth taken from lake camp , and we did not pause to study the bizarre forms into which the fabrics had been slashed .
slightly beyond this point we noticed a decided increase in the size and number of the side galleries , and concluded that the densely honeycombed region beneath the higher foothills must now have been reached .
the nameless scent was now curiously mixed with another and scarcely less offensive odor of what nature we could not guess , though we thought of decaying organisms and perhaps unknown subterranean fungi .
then came a startling expansion of the tunnel for which the carvings had not prepared us a broadening and rising into a lofty , elliptical cavern with a level floor , some feet long and fifty broad , and with many immense side passages leading away into cryptical darkness .
though this cavern was natural in appearance , an inspection with both torches suggested that it had been formed by the artificial destruction of several walls between adjacent honeycombings .
the walls were rough , and the high , vaulted roof was thick with stalactites ; but the solid rock floor had been smoothed off , and was free from all debris , detritus , or even dust to a positively abnormal extent .
except for the avenue through which we had come , this was true of the floors of all the great galleries opening off from it ; and the singularity of the condition was such as to set us vainly puzzling .
the curious new fetor which had supplemented the nameless scent was excessively pungent here ; so much so that it destroyed all trace of the other .
something about this whole place , with its polished and almost glistening floor , struck us as more vaguely baffling and horrible than any of the monstrous things we had previously encountered .
the regularity of the passage immediately ahead , as well as the larger proportion of there , prevented all confusion as to the right course amidst this plethora of equally great cave mouths .
nevertheless we resolved to resume our paper trailblazing if any further complexity should develop ; for dust tracks , of course , could no longer be expected .
upon resuming our direct progress we cast a beam of torchlight over the tunnel walls and stopped short in amazement at the supremely radical change which had come over the carvings in this part of the passage .
we realized , of course , the great decadence of the old ones ' sculpture at the time of the tunneling , and had indeed noticed the inferior workmanship of the arabesques in the stretches behind us .
but now , in this deeper section beyond the cavern , there was a sudden difference wholly transcending explanation a difference in basic nature as well as in mere quality , and involving so profound and calamitous a degradation of skill that nothing in the hitherto observed rate of decline could have led one to expect it .
this new and degenerate work was coarse , bold , and wholly lacking in delicacy of detail .
it was countersunk with exaggerated depth in bands following the same general line as the sparse cartouches of the earlier sections , but the height of the reliefs did not reach the level of the general surface .
danforth had the idea that it was a second carving a sort of palimpsest formed after the obliteration of a previous design .
in nature it was wholly decorative and conventional , and consisted of crude spirals and angles roughly following the quintile mathematical tradition of the old ones , yet seemingly more like a parody than a perpetuation of that tradition .
we could not get it out of our minds that some subtly but profoundly alien element had been added to the aesthetic feeling behind the technique an alien element , danforth guessed , that was responsible for the laborious substitution .
it was like , yet disturbingly unlike , what we had come to recognize as the old ones ' art ; and i was persistently reminded of such hybrid things as the ungainly palmyrene sculptures fashioned in the roman manner .
that others had recently noticed this belt of carving was hinted by the presence of a used flashlight battery on the floor in front of one of the most characteristic cartouches .
since we could not afford to spend any considerable time in study , we resumed our advance after a cursory look ; though frequently casting beams over the walls to see if any further decorative changes developed .
nothing of the sort was perceived , though the carvings were in places rather sparse because of the numerous mouths of lateral tunnels .
we saw and heard fewer penguins , but thought we caught a vague suspicion of an infinitely distant chorus of them somewhere deep within the earth .
the new and inexplicable odor was abominably strong , and we could detect scarcely a sign of that other nameless scent .
puffs of visible vapor ahead bespoke increasing contrasts in temperature , and the relative nearness of the sunless sea cliffs of the great abyss .
then , quite unexpectedly , we saw certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead obstructions which were quite definitely not penguins and turned on our second torch after making sure that the objects were quite stationary .
still another time have i come to a place where it is very difficult to proceed .
i ought to be hardened by this stage ; but there are some experiences and intimations which scar too deeply to permit of healing , and leave only such an added sensitiveness that memory reinspires all the original horror .
we saw , as i have said , certain obstructions on the polished floor ahead ; and i may add that our nostrils were assailed almost simultaneously by a very curious intensification of the strange prevailing fetor , now quite plainly mixed with the nameless stench of those others which had gone before .
the light of the second torch left no doubt of what the obstructions were , and we dared approach them only because we could see , even from a distance , that they were quite as past all harming power as had been the six similar specimens unearthed from the monstrous graves at poor lake camp .
they were , indeed , as lacking in completeness as most of those we had unearthed though it grew plain from the thick , dark green pool gathering around them that their incompleteness was of infinitely greater recency .
there seemed to be only four of them , whereas lake bulletins would have suggested no less than eight as forming the group which had preceded us .
to find them in this state was wholly unexpected , and we wondered what sort of monstrous struggle had occurred down here in the dark .
penguins , attacked in a body , retaliate savagely with their beaks , and our ears now made certain the existence of a rookery far beyond .
had those others disturbed such a place and aroused murderous pursuit ?
the obstructions did not suggest it , for penguins ' beaks against the tough tissues lake had dissected could hardly account for the terrible damage our approaching glance was beginning to make out .
besides , the huge blind birds we had seen appeared to be singularly peaceful .
had there , then , been a struggle among those others , and were the absent four responsible ?
if so , where were they ?
were they close at hand and likely to form an immediate menace to us ?
we glanced anxiously at some of the lateral passages as we continued our slow and frankly reluctant approach .
whatever the conflict was , it had clearly been that which had frightened the penguins into their unaccustomed wandering .
it must , then , have arisen near that faintly heard rookery in the incalculable gulf beyond , since there were no signs that any birds had normally dwelt here .
perhaps , we reflected , there had been a hideous running fight , with the weaker party seeking to get back to the cached sledges when their pursuers finished them .
one could picture the demoniac fray between namelessly monstrous entities as it surged out of the black abyss with great clouds of frantic penguins squawking and scurrying ahead .
i say that we approached those sprawling and incomplete obstructions slowly and reluctantly .
would to heaven we had never approached them at all , but had run back at top speed out of that blasphemous tunnel with the greasily smooth floors and the degenerate murals aping and mocking the things they had superseded run back , before we had seen what we did see , and before our minds were burned with something which will never let us breathe easily again !
both of our torches were turned on the prostrate objects , so that we soon realized the dominant factor in their incompleteness .
mauled , compressed , twisted , and ruptured as they were , their chief common injury was total decapitation .
from each one the tentacled starfish head had been removed ; and as we drew near we saw that the manner of removal looked more like some hellish tearing or suction than like any ordinary form of cleavage .
their noisome ichor formed a large , spreading pool ; but its stench was half overshadowed by the newer and stranger stench , here more pungent than at any other point along our route .
only when we had come very close to the sprawling obstructions could we trace that second , unexplainable fetor to any immediate source and the instant we did so danforth , remembering certain very vivid sculptures of the old ones ' history in the permian age one hundred and fifty million years ago , gave vent to a cry which echoed hysterically through that vaulted and archaic passage with the evil , palimpsest carvings .
i came only just short of echoing his cry myself ; for i had seen those primal sculptures , too , and had shudderingly admired the way the nameless artist had suggested that hideous slime coating found on certain incomplete and prostrate old ones those whom the frightful shoggoths had characteristically slain and sucked to a ghastly headlessness in the great war of resubjugation .
they were infamous , nightmare sculptures even when telling of , bygone things ; for shoggoths and their work ought not to be seen by human beings or portrayed by any beings .
the mad author of the necronomicon had nervously tried to swear that none had been bred on this planet , and that only drugged dreamers had even conceived them .
formless protoplasm able to mock and reflect all forms and organs and processes viscous agglutinations of bubbling cells rubbery spheroids infinitely plastic and ductile slaves of suggestion , builders of cities more and more sullen , more and more intelligent , more and more amphibious , more and more imitative !
great god !
what madness made even those blasphemous old ones willing to use and carve such things ?
and now , when danforth and i saw the freshly glistening and reflectively iridescent black slime which clung thickly to those headless bodies and stank obscenely with that new , unknown odor whose cause only a diseased fancy could envisage clung to those bodies and sparkled less voluminously on a smooth part of the accursedly resculptured wall in a series of grouped dots we understood the quality of cosmic fear to its uttermost depths .
it was not fear of those four missing others for all too well did we suspect they would do no harm again .
poor devils !
after all , they were not evil things of their kind .
they were the men of another age and another order of being .
nature had played a hellish jest on them as it will on any others that human madness , callousness , or cruelty may hereafter dig up in that hideously dead or sleeping polar waste and this was their tragic homecoming .
they had not been even savages for what indeed had they done ?
that awful awakening in the cold of an unknown epoch perhaps an attack by the furry , frantically barking quadrupeds , and a dazed defense against them and the equally frantic white simians with the queer wrappings and paraphernalia poor lake , poor gedney and poor old ones !
scientists to the last what had they done that we would not have done in their place ?
god , what intelligence and persistence !
what a facing of the incredible , just as those carven kinsmen and forbears had faced things only a little less incredible !
radiates , vegetables , monstrosities , star spawn whatever they had been , they were men !
they had crossed the icy peaks on whose templed slopes they had once worshipped and roamed among the tree ferns .
they had found their dead city brooding under its curse , and had read its carven latter days as we had done .
they had tried to reach their living fellows in fabled depths of blackness they had never seen and what had they found ?
all this flashed in unison through the thoughts of danforth and me as we looked from those headless , shapes to the loathsome palimpsest sculptures and the diabolical dot groups of fresh slime on the wall beside them looked and understood what must have triumphed and survived down there in the cyclopean water city of that nighted , abyss , whence even now a sinister curling mist had begun to belch pallidly as if in answer to danforth hysterical scream .
the shock of recognizing that monstrous slime and headlessness had frozen us into mute , motionless statues , and it is only through later conversations that we have learned of the complete identity of our thoughts at that moment .
it seemed aeons that we stood there , but actually it could not have been more than ten or fifteen seconds .
that hateful , pallid mist curled forward as if veritably driven by some remoter advancing bulk and then came a sound which upset much of what we had just decided , and in so doing broke the spell and enabled us to run like mad past squawking , confused penguins over our former trail back to the city , along megalithic corridors to the great open circle , and up that archaic spiral ramp in a frenzied , automatic plunge for the sane outer air and light of day .
the new sound , as i have intimated , upset much that we had decided ; because it was what poor lake dissection had led us to attribute to those we had judged dead .
it was , danforth later told me , precisely what he had caught in infinitely muffled form when at that spot beyond the alley corner above the glacial level ; and it certainly had a shocking resemblance to the wind pipings we had both heard around the lofty mountain caves .
at the risk of seeming puerile i will add another thing , too , if only because of the surprising way danforth impressions chimed with mine .
of course common reading is what prepared us both to make the interpretation , though danforth has hinted at queer notions about unsuspected and forbidden sources to which poe may have had access when writing his arthur gordon pym a century ago .
it will be remembered that in that fantastic tale there is a word of unknown but terrible and prodigious significance connected with the antarctic and screamed eternally by the gigantic spectrally snowy birds of that malign region core .
!
!
that , i may admit , is exactly what we thought we heard conveyed by that sudden sound behind the advancing white mist that insidious musical piping over a singularly wide range .
we were in full flight before three notes or syllables had been uttered , though we knew that the swiftness of the old ones would enable any and pursuing survivor of the slaughter to overtake us in a moment if it really wished to do so .
we had a vague hope , however , that nonaggressive conduct and a display of kindred reason might cause such a being to spare us in case of capture , if only from scientific curiosity .
after all , if such an one had nothing to fear for itself , it would have no motive in harming us .
concealment being futile at this juncture , we used our torch for a running glance behind , and perceived that the mist was thinning .
would we see , at last , a complete and living specimen of those others ?
again came that insidious musical piping !
!
then , noting that we were actually gaining on our pursuer , it occurred to us that the entity might be wounded .
we could take no chances , however , since it was very obviously approaching in answer to danforth scream , rather than in flight from any other entity .
the timing was too close to admit of doubt .
of the whereabouts of that less conceivable and less mentionable nightmare that fetid , unglimpsed mountain of protoplasm whose race had conquered the abyss and sent land pioneers to recarve and squirm through the burrows of the hills we could form no guess ; and it cost us a genuine pang to leave this probably crippled old one perhaps a lone survivor to the peril of recapture and a nameless fate .
thank heaven we did not slacken our run .
the curling mist had thickened again , and was driving ahead with increased speed ; whilst the straying penguins in our rear were squawking and screaming and displaying signs of a panic really surprising in view of their relatively minor confusion when we had passed them .
once more came that sinister , piping !
!
we had been wrong .
the thing was not wounded , but had merely paused on encountering the bodies of its fallen kindred and the hellish slime inscription above them .
we could never know what that demon message was but those burials at lake camp had shown how much importance the beings attached to their dead .
our recklessly used torch now revealed ahead of us the large open cavern where various ways converged , and we were glad to be leaving those morbid palimpsest sculptures almost felt even when scarcely seen behind .
another thought which the advent of the cave inspired was the possibility of losing our pursuer at this bewildering focus of large galleries .
there were several of the blind albino penguins in the open space , and it seemed clear that their fear of the oncoming entity was extreme to the point of unaccountability .
if at that point we dimmed our torch to the very lowest limit of traveling need , keeping it strictly in front of us , the frightened squawking motions of the huge birds in the mist might muffle our footfalls , screen our true course , and somehow set up a false lead .
amidst the churning , spiraling fog , the littered and unglistening floor of the main tunnel beyond this point , as differing from the other morbidly polished burrows , could hardly form a highly distinguishing feature ; even , so far as we could conjecture , for those indicated special senses which made the old ones partly , though imperfectly , independent of light in emergencies .
in fact , we were somewhat apprehensive lest we go astray ourselves in our haste .
for we had , of course , decided to keep straight on toward the dead city ; since the consequences of loss in those unknown foothill honeycombings would be unthinkable .
the fact that we survived and emerged is sufficient proof that the thing did take a wrong gallery whilst we providentially hit on the right one .
the penguins alone could not have saved us , but in conjunction with the mist they seem to have done so .
only a benign fate kept the curling vapors thick enough at the right moment , for they were constantly shifting and threatening to vanish .
indeed , they did lift for a second just before we emerged from the nauseously resculptured tunnel into the cave ; so that we actually caught one first and only half glimpse of the oncoming entity as we cast a final , desperately fearful glance backward before dimming the torch and mixing with the penguins in the hope of dodging pursuit .
if the fate which screened us was benign , that which gave us the half glimpse was infinitely the opposite ; for to that flash of semivision can be traced a full half of the horror which has ever since haunted us .
our exact motive in looking back again was perhaps no more than the immemorial instinct of the pursued to gauge the nature and course of its pursuer ; or perhaps it was an automatic attempt to answer a subconscious question raised by one of our senses .
in the midst of our flight , with all our faculties centered on the problem of escape , we were in no condition to observe and analyze details ; yet even so , our latent brain cells must have wondered at the message brought them by our nostrils .
afterward we realized what it was that our retreat from the fetid slime coating on those headless obstructions , and the coincident approach of the pursuing entity , had not brought us the exchange of stenches which logic called for .
in the neighborhood of the prostrate things that new and lately unexplainable fetor had been wholly dominant ; but by this time it ought to have largely given place to the nameless stench associated with those others .
this it had not done for instead , the newer and less bearable smell was now virtually undiluted , and growing more and more poisonously insistent each second .
so we glanced back simultaneously , it would appear ; though no doubt the incipient motion of one prompted the imitation of the other .
as we did so we flashed both torches full strength at the momentarily thinned mist ; either from sheer primitive anxiety to see all we could , or in a less primitive but equally unconscious effort to dazzle the entity before we dimmed our light and dodged among the penguins of the labyrinth center ahead .
unhappy act !
not orpheus himself , or lot wife , paid much more dearly for a backward glance .
and again came that shocking , piping !
!
i might as well be frank even if i can not bear to be quite direct in stating what we saw ; though at the time we felt that it was not to be admitted even to each other .
the words reaching the reader can never even suggest the awfulness of the sight itself .
it crippled our consciousness so completely that i wonder we had the residual sense to dim our torches as planned , and to strike the right tunnel toward the dead city .
instinct alone must have carried us through perhaps better than reason could have done ; though if that was what saved us , we paid a high price .
of reason we certainly had little enough left .
danforth was totally unstrung , and the first thing i remember of the rest of the journey was hearing him lightheadedly chant an hysterical formula in which i alone of mankind could have found anything but insane irrelevance .
it reverberated in falsetto echoes among the squawks of the penguins ; reverberated through the vaultings ahead , and thank god through the now empty vaultings behind .
he could not have begun it at once else we would not have been alive and blindly racing .
i shudder to think of what a shade of difference in his nervous reactions might have brought .
south station under washington under park street under kendall central harvard the poor fellow was chanting the familiar stations of the tunnel that burrowed through our peaceful native soil thousands of miles away in new england , yet to me the ritual had neither irrelevance nor home feeling .
it had only horror , because i knew unerringly the monstrous , nefandous analogy that had suggested it .
we had expected , upon looking back , to see a terrible and incredible moving entity if the mists were thin enough ; but of that entity we had formed a clear idea .
what we did see for the mists were indeed all too malignly thinned was something altogether different , and immeasurably more hideous and detestable .
it was the utter , objective embodiment of the fantastic novelist thing that should not be ; and its nearest comprehensible analogue is a vast , onrushing subway train as one sees it from a station platform the great black front looming colossally out of infinite subterranean distance , constellated with strangely colored lights and filling the prodigious burrow as a piston fills a cylinder .
but we were not on a station platform .
we were on the track ahead as the nightmare , plastic column of fetid black iridescence oozed tightly onward through its sinus , gathering unholy speed and driving before it a spiral , rethickening cloud of the pallid .
it was a terrible , indescribable thing vaster than any subway train a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles , faintly , and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and as pustules of greenish light all over the front that bore down upon us , crushing the frantic penguins and slithering over the glistening floor that it and its kind had swept so evilly free of all litter .
still came that eldritch , mocking cry !
!
and at last we remembered that the demoniac shoggoths given life , thought , and plastic organ patterns solely by the old ones , and having no language save that which the dot groups expressed had likewise no voice save the imitated accents of their bygone masters .
danforth and i have recollections of emerging into the great sculptured hemisphere and of threading our back trail through the cyclopean rooms and corridors of the dead city ; yet these are purely dream fragments involving no memory of volition , details , or physical exertion .
it was as if we floated in a nebulous world or dimension without time , causation , or orientation .
the gray of the vast circular space sobered us somewhat ; but we did not go near those cached sledges or look again at poor gedney and the dog .
they have a strange and titanic mausoleum , and i hope the end of this planet will find them still undisturbed .
it was while struggling up the colossal spiral incline that we first felt the terrible fatigue and short breath which our race through the thin plateau air had produced ; but not even fear of collapse could make us pause before reaching the normal outer realm of sun and sky .
there was something vaguely appropriate about our departure from those buried epochs ; for as we wound our panting way up the cylinder of primal masonry , we glimpsed beside us a continuous procession of heroic sculptures in the dead race early and undecayed technique a farewell from the old ones , written fifty million years ago .
finally scrambling out at the top , we found ourselves on a great mound of tumbled blocks , with the curved walls of higher stonework rising westward , and the brooding peaks of the great mountains showing beyond the more crumbled structures toward the east .
the low antarctic sun of midnight peered redly from the southern horizon through rifts in the jagged ruins , and the terrible age and deadness of the nightmare city seemed all the starker by contrast with such relatively known and accustomed things as the features of the polar landscape .
the sky above was a churning and opalescent mass of tenuous , and the cold clutched at our vitals .
wearily resting the to which we had instinctively clung throughout our desperate flight , we rebuttoned our heavy garments for the stumbling climb down the mound and the walk through the stone maze to the foothills where our aeroplane waited .
of what had set us fleeing from that darkness of earth secret and archaic gulfs we said nothing at all .
in less than a quarter of an hour we had found the steep grade to the foothills the probable ancient terrace by which we had descended , and could see the dark bulk of our great plane amidst the sparse ruins on the rising slope ahead .
halfway uphill toward our goal we paused for a momentary breathing spell , and turned to look again at the fantastic tangle of incredible stone shapes below us once more outlined mystically against an unknown west .
as we did so we saw that the sky beyond had lost its morning haziness ; the restless having moved up to the zenith , where their mocking outlines seemed on the point of settling into some bizarre pattern which they feared to make quite definite or conclusive .
there now lay revealed on the ultimate white horizon behind the grotesque city a dim , elfin line of pinnacled violet whose heights loomed dreamlike against the beckoning rose color of the western sky .
up toward this shimmering rim sloped the ancient , the depressed course of the bygone river traversing it as an irregular ribbon of shadow .
for a second we gasped in admiration of the scene unearthly cosmic beauty , and then vague horror began to creep into our souls .
for this far violet line could be nothing else than the terrible mountains of the forbidden land highest of earth peaks and focus of earth evil ; harborers of nameless horrors and archaean secrets ; shunned and prayed to by those who feared to carve their meaning ; untrodden by any living thing on earth , but visited by the sinister lightnings and sending strange beams across the plains in the polar night beyond doubt the unknown archetype of that dreaded kadath in the cold waste beyond abhorrent leng , whereof primal legends hint evasively .
if the sculptured maps and pictures in that prehuman city had told truly , these cryptic violet mountains could not be much less than three hundred miles away ; yet none the less sharply did their dim elfin essence appear above that remote and snowy rim , like the serrated edge of a monstrous alien planet about to rise into unaccustomed heavens .
their height , then , must have been tremendous beyond all comparison carrying them up into tenuous atmospheric strata peopled only by such gaseous wraiths as rash flyers have barely lived to whisper of after unexplainable falls .
looking at them , i thought nervously of certain sculptured hints of what the great bygone river had washed down into the city from their accursed slopes and wondered how much sense and how much folly had lain in the fears of those old ones who carved them so reticently .
i recalled how their northerly end must come near the coast at queen mary land , where even at that moment sir douglas mawson expedition was doubtless working less than a thousand miles away ; and hoped that no evil fate would give sir douglas and his men a glimpse of what might lie beyond the protecting coastal range .
such thoughts formed a measure of my overwrought condition at the time and danforth seemed to be even worse .
yet long before we had passed the great ruin and reached our plane , our fears had become transferred to the lesser but range whose recrossing lay ahead of us .
from these foothills the black , slopes reared up starkly and hideously against the east , again reminding us of those strange asian paintings of nicholas roerich ; and when we thought of the frightful amorphous entities that might have pushed their fetidly squirming way even to the topmost hollow pinnacles , we could not face without panic the prospect of again sailing by those suggestive skyward cave mouths where the wind made sounds like an evil musical piping over a wide range .
to make matters worse , we saw distinct traces of local mist around several of the summits as poor lake must have done when he made that early mistake about volcanism and thought shiveringly of that kindred mist from which we had just escaped ; of that , and of the blasphemous , abyss whence all such vapors came .
all was well with the plane , and we clumsily hauled on our heavy flying furs .
danforth got the engine started without trouble , and we made a very smooth over the nightmare city .
below us the primal cyclopean masonry spread out as it had done when first we saw it , and we began rising and turning to test the wind for our crossing through the pass .
at a very high level there must have been great disturbance , since the clouds of the zenith were doing all sorts of fantastic things ; but at thousand feet , the height we needed for the pass , we found navigation quite practicable .
as we drew close to the jutting peaks the wind strange piping again became manifest , and i could see danforth hands trembling at the controls .
rank amateur that i was , i thought at that moment that i might be a better navigator than he in effecting the dangerous crossing between pinnacles ; and when i made motions to change seats and take over his duties he did not protest .
i tried to keep all my skill and about me , and stared at the sector of reddish farther sky betwixt the walls of the pass resolutely refusing to pay attention to the puffs of vapor , and wishing that i had ears like ulysses ' men off the siren coast to keep that disturbing windpiping from my consciousness .
but danforth , released from his piloting and keyed up to a dangerous nervous pitch , could not keep quiet .
i felt him turning and wriggling about as he looked back at the terrible receding city , ahead at the , peaks , sidewise at the bleak sea of snowy , foothills , and upward at the seething , grotesquely clouded sky .
it was then , just as i was trying to steer safely through the pass , that his mad shrieking brought us so close to disaster by shattering my tight hold on myself and causing me to fumble helplessly with the controls for a moment .
a second afterward my resolution triumphed and we made the crossing safely yet i am afraid that danforth will never be the same again .
i have said that danforth refused to tell me what final horror made him scream out so insanely a horror which , i feel sadly sure , is mainly responsible for his present breakdown .
we had snatches of shouted conversation above the wind piping and the engine buzzing as we reached the safe side of the range and swooped slowly down toward the camp , but that had mostly to do with the pledges of secrecy we had made as we prepared to leave the nightmare city .
certain things , we had agreed , were not for people to know and discuss lightly and i would not speak of them now but for the need of heading off that expedition , and others , at any cost .
it is absolutely necessary , for the peace and safety of mankind , that some of earth dark , dead corners and unplumbed depths be let alone ; lest sleeping abnormalities wake to resurgent life , and blasphemously surviving nightmares squirm and splash out of their black lairs to newer and wider conquests .
all that danforth has ever hinted is that the final horror was a mirage .
it was not , he declares , anything connected with the cubes and caves of those echoing , vaporous , mountains of madness which we crossed ; but a single fantastic , demoniac glimpse , among the churning zenith clouds , of what lay back of those other violet westward mountains which the old ones had shunned and feared .
it is very probable that the thing was a sheer delusion born of the previous stresses we had passed through , and of the actual though unrecognized mirage of the dead transmontane city experienced near lake camp the day before ; but it was so real to danforth that he suffers from it still .
he has on rare occasions whispered disjointed and irresponsible things about the black pit , the carven rim , the protoshoggoths , the windowless solids with five dimensions , the nameless cylinder , the elder pharos , , the primal white jelly , the color out of space , the wings , the eyes in darkness , the , the original , the eternal , the undying , and other bizarre conceptions ; but when he is fully himself he repudiates all this and attributes it to his curious and macabre reading of earlier years .
danforth , indeed , is known to be among the few who have ever dared go completely through that copy of the necronomicon kept under lock and key in the college library .
the higher sky , as we crossed the range , was surely vaporous and disturbed enough ; and although i did not see the zenith , i can well imagine that its swirls of ice dust may have taken strange forms .
imagination , knowing how vividly distant scenes can sometimes be reflected , refracted , and magnified by such layers of restless cloud , might easily have supplied the rest and , of course , danforth did not hint any of these specific horrors till after his memory had had a chance to draw on his bygone reading .
he could never have seen so much in one instantaneous glance .
at the time , his shrieks were confined to the repetition of a single , mad word of all too obvious source !
!
the essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved , that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie , and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure ; and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust , a philosopher may , without any criminal necromancy , call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incinerated .
borellus i .
a result and a prologue .
an antecedent and a horror .
a search and an evocation .
a mutation and a madness a nightmare and a cataclysm i .
a result and a prologue from a private hospital for the insane near providence , rhode island , there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person .
he bore the name of charles dexter ward , and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind .
doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case , since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character .
in the first place , the patient seemed oddly older than his years would warrant .
mental disturbance , it is true , will age one rapidly ; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire .
in the second place , his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel .
respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry ; the voice was lost , so that no sounds above a whisper were possible ; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised , and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded , either normal or pathological .
the skin had a morbid chill and dryness , and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit .
even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared , whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before .
in general , all physicians agree that in ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent .
psychologically , too , charles ward was unique .
his madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises , and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms .
willett , who was ward family physician , affirms that the patient gross mental capacity , as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity , had actually increased since the seizure .
ward , it is true , was always a scholar and an antiquarian ; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists .
it was , indeed , a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital , so powerful and lucid did the youth mind seem ; and only on the evidence of others , and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence , was he finally placed in confinement .
to the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted ; and shrewd observers , failing to foresee his escape , freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody .
only willett , who brought charles ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since , seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom .
he had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues .
willett , indeed , presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case .
he was the last to see the patient before his flight , and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when ward escape became known three hours later .
that escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of waite hospital .
a window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it , yet after that talk with willett the youth was undeniably gone .
willett himself has no public explanations to offer , though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape .
many , indeed , feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him .
he had found ward in his room , but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain .
when they opened the door the patient was not there , and all they found was the open window with a chill april breeze blowing in a cloud of fine dust that almost choked them .
true , the dogs howled some time before ; but that was while willett was still present , and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on .
ward father was told at once over the telephone , but he seemed more saddened than surprised .
by the time waite called in person , willett had been talking with him , and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape .
only from certain closely confidential friends of willett and the senior ward have any clues been gained , and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence .
the one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed .
charles ward was an antiquarian from infancy , no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him , and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents ' old mansion in prospect street on the crest of the hill .
with the years his devotion to ancient things increased ; so that history , genealogy , and the study of colonial architecture , furniture , and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests .
these tastes are important to remember in considering his madness ; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus , they play a prominent part in its superficial form .
the gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters , and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning ; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of .
the odd thing was that ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well .
he had , it appears , lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity ; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain .
that this wholesale deletion had occurred , he did his best to hide ; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in and his education in the schools of our own time .
alienists are now wondering how , in view of his vitally impaired range of data , the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today ; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal .
the beginning of ward madness is a matter of dispute among alienists .
lyman , the eminent boston authority , places it in or , during the boy last year at the moses brown school , when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult , and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make .
this is certainly borne out by ward altered habits at the time , especially by his continual search through town records and among old for a certain grave dug in ; the grave of an ancestor named joseph curwen , some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in olney court , on stampers ' hill , which curwen was known to have built and occupied .
it is , broadly speaking , undeniable that the winter of saw a great change in ward ; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad , varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefather grave .
from this opinion , however , willett substantially dissents ; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient , and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last .
those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him ; so that his voice trembles when he tells them , and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them .
willett admits that the change of would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of ; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made .
granting freely that the boy was always temperamentally , and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him , he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness ; crediting instead ward own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human though was likely to be marvellous and profound .
the true madness , he is certain , came with a later change ; after the curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed ; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made , and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances ; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated , and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions ; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous pawtuxet gossip ; and after the patient memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed .
it was only about this time , willett points out with much acuteness , that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with ward ; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youth claim regarding his crucial discovery .
in the first place , two workmen of high intelligence saw joseph curwen ancient papers found .
secondly , the boy once shewed willett those papers and a page of the curwen diary , and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness .
the hole where ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality , and willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved .
then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the orne and hutchinson letters , and the problem of the curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about allen ; these things , and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in willett pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience .
and most conclusive of all , there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations ; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge .
one must look back at charles ward earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly .
in the autumn of , and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period , he had begun his junior year at the moses brown school , which lies very near his home .
the old main building , erected in , had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense ; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape .
his social activities were few ; and his hours were spent mainly at home , in rambling walks , in his classes and drills , and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the city hall , the state house , the public library , the athenaeum , the historical society , the john carter brown and john hay libraries of brown university , and the newly opened shepley library in benefit street .
one may picture him yet as he was in those days ; tall , slim , and blond , with studious eyes and a slight stoop , dressed somewhat carelessly , and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness .
his walks were always adventures in antiquity , during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before .
his home was a great georgian mansion atop the precipitous hill that rises just east of the river ; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires , domes , roofs , and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond .
here he was born , and from the lovely classic porch of the brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage ; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken , and on toward the stately colleges along the shady , sumptuous street , whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow , doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens .
he had been wheeled , too , along sleepy congdon street , one tier lower down on the steep hill , and with all its eastern homes on high terraces .
the small wooden houses averaged a greater age here , for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed ; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village .
the nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of prospect terrace to chat with policemen ; and one of the child first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment , all violet and mystic against a fevered , apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens .
the vast marble dome of the state house stood out in massive silhouette , its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky .
when he was larger his famous walks began ; first with his impatiently dragged nurse , and then alone in dreamy meditation .
farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture , each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city .
he would hesitate gingerly down vertical jenckes street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady benefit street corner , where before him was a wooden antique with an pair of doorways , and beside him a prehistoric with a bit of primal farmyard remaining , and the great judge durfee house with its fallen vestiges of georgian grandeur .
it was getting to be a slum here ; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place , and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals .
on the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps , and the young charles could picture them as they were when the street was new , and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible .
westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above , down to the old town street that the founders had laid out at the river edge in .
here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning , huddled houses of immense antiquity ; and fascinated though he was , it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors .
he found it much less formidable to continue along benefit street past the iron fence of john hidden churchyard and the rear of the colony house and the mouldering bulk of the golden ball inn where washington stopped .
at meeting street the successive gaol lane and king street of other periods he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope , and downward to the west , glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient sign of shakespeare head where the providence gazette and was printed before the revolution .
then came the exquisite first baptist church of , luxurious with its matchless gibbs steeple , and the georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by .
here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better , flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions ; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west , spectral in their archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old recalls its proud east india days amidst polyglot vice and squalor , rotting wharves , and , with such surviving alley names as packet , bullion , gold , silver , coin , doubloon , sovereign , guilder , dollar , dime , and cent .
sometimes , as he grew taller and more adventurous , young ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses , broken transoms , tumbling steps , twisted balustrades , swarthy faces , and nameless odours ; winding from south main to south water , searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched , and returning northward at this lower level past the warehouses and the broad square at the great bridge , where the market house still stands firm on its ancient arches .
in that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff , decked with its two georgian spires and crowned by the vast new christian science dome as london is crowned by paul .
he like mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon , when the slanting sunlight touches the market house and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold , and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where providence indiamen used to ride at anchor .
after a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poet love for the sight , and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious railings .
at other times , and in later years , he would seek for vivid contrasts ; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home , where the hill drops to the lower eminence of stampers ' hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the boston stage coach used to start before the revolution , and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about george , benevolent , power , and williams streets , where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger .
these rambles , together with the diligent studies which accompanied them , certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from charles ward mind ; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell , in that fateful winter of , the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition .
willett is certain that , up to this winter of first change , charles ward antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid .
graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value , and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid .
then , by insidious degrees , there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before ; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very man named joseph curwen , who had come from salem in march of , and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered .
ward welcome potter had in married a certain tillinghast , daughter of eliza , daughter to capt .
james tillinghast , ' of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace .
late in , whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript , the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name , by which in a eliza curwen , widow of joseph curwen , resumed , along with her daughter ann , her maiden name of tillinghast ; on the ground her husband name was become a public reproach by reason of what was knowne after his decease ; the which confirming an antient common rumour , tho ' not to be credited by a loyall wife till so proven as to be wholely past doubting . '
this entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers .
it was at once clear to charles ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown .
the discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person ; about whom there remained so few publicly available records , aside from those becoming public only in modern times , that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory .
what did appear , moreover , was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget ; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid .
before this , ward had been content to let his romancing about old joseph curwen remain in the idle stage ; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently character , he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him .
in this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations ; for old letters , diaries , and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy .
one important sidelight came from a point as remote as new york , where some rhode island colonial correspondence was stored in the museum at fraunces ' tavern .
the really crucial thing , though , and what in willett opinion formed the definite source of ward undoing , was the matter found in august behind the panelling of the crumbling house in olney court .
it was that , beyond a doubt , which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit .
.
an antecedent and a horror joseph curwen , as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what ward heard and unearthed , was a very astonishing , enigmatic , and obscurely horrible individual .
he had fled from salem to providence that universal haven of the odd , the free , and the dissenting at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic ; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments .
he was a man of about thirty , and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of providence ; thereafter buying a home lot just north of gregory dexter at about the foot of olney street .
his house was built on stampers ' hill west of the town street , in what later became olney court ; and in he replaced this with a larger one , on the same site , which is still standing .
now the first odd thing about joseph curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival .
he engaged in shipping enterprises , purchased wharfage near cove , helped rebuild the great bridge in , and in was one of the founders of the congregational church on the hill ; but always did he retain his nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or .
as decades mounted up , this singular quality began to excite wide notice ; but curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers , and practised a simplicity of living which did not wear him our .
how such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant , and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night , was not very clear to the townsfolk ; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity .
it was held , for the most part , that curwen incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition .
gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from london and the indies on his ships or purchased in newport , boston , and new york ; and when old jabez bowen came from rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the great bridge at the sign of the unicorn and mortar , there was ceaseless talk of the drugs , acids , and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him .
acting on the assumption that curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill , many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid ; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a way , and always gave them potions in response to their requests , it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit .
at length , when over fifty years had passed since the stranger advent , and without producing more than five years ' apparent change in his face and physique , the people began to whisper more darkly ; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn .
private letters and diaries of the period reveal , too , a multitude of other reasons why joseph curwen was marvelled at , feared , and finally shunned like a plague .
his passion for graveyards , in which he was glimpsed at all hours , and under all conditions , was notorious ; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish .
on the pawtuxet road he had a farm , at which he generally lived during the summer , and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night .
here his only visible servants , farmers , and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged narragansett indians ; the husband dumb and curiously scarred , and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance , probably due to a mixture of negro blood .
in the of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted .
curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles , bags , or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks , crucibles , alembics , and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room ; and prophesied in whispers that the chymist by which they meant alchemist would not be long in finding the philosopher stone .
the nearest neighbours to this farm the fenners , a quarter of a mile away had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the curwen place in the night .
there were cries , they said , and sustained howlings ; and they did not like the large numbers of livestock which thronged the pastures , for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat , milk , and wool .
the identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the kingstown farmers .
then , too , there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows .
great bridge idlers likewise had much to say of curwen town house in olney court ; not so much the fine new one built in , when the man must have been nearly a century old , but the first low one with the windowless attic and shingled sides , whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition .
here there was less mystery , it is true ; but the hours at which lights were seen , the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants , the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged french housekeeper , the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived , and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times , all combined with what was known of the pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name .
in choicer circles , too , the curwen home was by no means undiscussed ; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town , he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort , whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy .
his birth was known to be good , since the curwens or corwins of salem needed no introduction in new england .
it developed that joseph curwen had travelled much in very early life , living for a time in england and making at least two voyages to the orient ; and his speech , when he deigned to use it , was that of a learned and cultivated englishman .
but for some reason or other curwen did not care for society .
whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor , he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane .
there seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic , sardonic arrogance , as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities .
when checkley the famous wit came from boston in to be rector of king church , he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much ; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his host discourse .
charles ward told his father , when they discussed curwen one winter evening , that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric , but that all diarists agree concerning checkley reluctance to repeat anything he had heard .
the good man had been hideously shocked , and could never recall joseph curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed .
more definite , however , was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit .
in john merritt , an elderly english gentleman of literary and scientific leanings , came from newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing , and built a fine country seat on the neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section .
he lived in considerable style and comfort , keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town , and taking great pride in his telescope , his microscope , and his library of english and latin books .
hearing of curwen as the owner of the best library in providence , merritt early paid him a call , and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been .
his admiration for his host ample shelves , which besides the greek , latin , and english classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical , mathematical , and scientific works including paracelsus , agricola , van helmont , sylvius , glauber , boyle , boerhaave , becher , and stahl , led curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before ; and the two drove out at once in merritt coach .
merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse , but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical , alchemical , and theological subjects which curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing .
perhaps , however , the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice .
this bizarre collection , besides a host of standard works which merritt was not too alarmed to envy , embraced nearly all the cabbalists , daemonologists , and magicians known to man ; and was a of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology .
hermes trismegistus in mesnard edition , the turba philosophorum , geber liber investigationis , and artephius key of wisdom all were there ; with the cabbalistic zohar , peter jammy set of albertus magnus , raymond lully ars magna et ultima in zetsner edition , roger bacon thesaurus chemicus , fludd clavis alchimiae , and trithemius de lapide philosophico crowding them close .
mediaeval jews and arabs were represented in profusion , and merritt turned pale when , upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the , he found it was in truth the forbidden necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred , of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of kingsport , in the province of the .
but oddly enough , the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail .
on the huge mahogany table there lay face downwards a badly worn copy of borellus , bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in curwen hand .
the book was open at about its middle , and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous beneath the lines of mystic that the visitor could not resist scanning it through .
whether it was the nature of the passage underscored , or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring , he could not tell ; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly .
he recalled it to the end of his days , writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector .
it read essential saltes of animals may be so prepared and preserved , that an ingenious man may have the whole ark of noah in his own studie , and raise the fine shape of an animal out of its ashes at his pleasure ; and by the lyke method from the essential saltes of humane dust , a philosopher may , without any criminal necromancy , call up the shape of any dead ancestour from the dust whereinto his bodie has been incinerated . '
it was near the docks along the southerly part of the town street , however , that the worst things were muttered about joseph curwen .
sailors are superstitious folk ; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum , slave , and molasses sloops , the rakish privateers , and the great brigs of the browns , crawfords , and tillinghasts , all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim , deceptively figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the curwen warehouse in doubloon street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the curwen ships rode restlessly .
curwen own clerks and captains hated and feared him , and all his sailors were mongrel from martinique , eustatius , havana , or port royal .
it was , in a way , the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held .
a crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave , some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that ; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men .
that many of the errands had concerned the farm of pawtuxet road , and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place , was not forgotten ; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands .
almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the providence wharves , and their replacement in the west indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant .
by joseph curwen was virtually an outcast , suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named , understood , or even proved to exist .
the last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in , for in march and april of that year two royal regiments on their way to new france were quartered in providence , and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion .
rumour dwelt on the frequency with which curwen was wont to be seen talking with the strangers ; and as several of them began to be missed , people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen .
what would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on , no one can tell .
meanwhile the merchant worldly affairs were prospering .
he had a virtual monopoly of the town trade in saltpetre , black pepper , and cinnamon , and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the browns in his importation of brassware , indigo , cotton , woollens , salt , rigging , iron , paper , and english goods of every kind .
such shopkeepers as james green , at the sign of the elephant in cheapside , the russells , at the sign of the golden eagle across the bridge , or clark and nightingale at the and fish near new , depended almost wholly upon him for their stock ; and his arrangements with the local distillers , the narragansett dairymen and , and the newport , made him one of the prime exporters of the colony .
ostracised though he was , he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort .
when the colony house burned down , he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street was built in .
in that same year , too , he helped rebuild the great bridge after the october gale .
he replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the colony house fire , and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy market parade and town street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or causey in the middle .
about this time , also , he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving .
when the whitefield adherents broke off from cotton hill church in and founded deacon snow church across the bridge , curwen had gone with them ; though his zeal and attendance soon abated .
now , however , he cultivated piety once more ; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked .
the sight of this strange , pallid man , hardly in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old , seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse , was at once a pathetic , a dramatic , and a contemptible thing .
such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures , however , that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him ; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased .
he must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions , for he was never again caught at such wanderings ; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion .
his rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high ; but not until modern times , when charles ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the shepley library , did it occur to any person save one embittered youth , perhaps to make dark comparisons between the large number of guinea blacks he imported until , and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to at the great bridge or to the planters of the narragansett country .
certainly , the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound , once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him .
but of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight .
curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted , as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant ; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer .
his elaborate studies and experiments , whatever they may have been , apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance ; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained , it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then .
judgement demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of providence , so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation , transparent excuses or errands elsewhere , and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness .
his clerks , being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ , were giving him much worry ; and he held to his and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them a mortgage , a promissory note , or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare .
in many cases , diarists have recorded with some awe , curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use .
during the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongue end .
about this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community .
hitherto a complete hermit , he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage ; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible .
it may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance ; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them ; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned .
naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received , hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure .
such candidates , he found , were not at all easy to discover ; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty , accomplishments , and social security .
at length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest , a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named dutee tillinghast , whose only daughter eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress .
capt .
tillinghast was completely under the domination of curwen ; and consented , after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on power lane hill , to sanction the blasphemous alliance .
eliza tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age , and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted .
she had attended stephen jackson school opposite the parade ; and had been diligently instructed by her mother , before the latter death of smallpox in , in all the arts and refinements of domestic life .
a sampler of hers , worked in at the age of nine , may still be found in the rooms of the rhode island historical society .
after her mother death she had kept the house , aided only by one old black woman .
her arguments with her father concerning the proposed curwen marriage must have been painful indeed ; but of these we have no record .
certain it is that her engagement to young ezra weeden , second mate of the crawford packet enterprise , was dutifully broken off , and that her union with joseph curwen took place on the seventh of march , , in the baptist church , in the presence of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast ; the ceremony being performed by the younger samuel winsor .
the gazette mentioned the event very briefly , and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out .
ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note , observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language evening last , joseph curwen , of this town , merchant , was married to miss eliza tillinghast , daughter of capt .
dutee tillinghast , a young lady who has real merit , added to a beautiful person , to grace the connubial state and perpetuate its felicity . '
the collection of letters , discovered by charles ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of melville peters , , of george , and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period , throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this match .
the social influence of the tillinghasts , however , was not to be denied ; and once more joseph curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold .
his acceptance was by no means complete , and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture ; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat torn down .
in his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration .
the new house in olney court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations , and although curwen was much absent at the pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited , he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence .
only one person remained in open enmity with him , this being the youthful ship officer whose engagement to eliza tillinghast had been so abruptly broken .
ezra weeden had frankly vowed vengeance ; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition , was now gaining a , dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband .
on the seventh of may , , curwen only child ann was born ; and was christened by the rev .
john graves of king church , of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage , in order to compromise between their respective congregational and baptist affiliations .
the record of this birth , as well as that of the marriage two years before , was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear ; and charles ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widow change of name had apprised him of his own relationship , and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness .
the birth entry , indeed , was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist graves , who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the revolution .
ward had tried this source because he knew that his ann tillinghast potter had been an episcopalian .
shortly after the birth of his daughter , an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness , curwen resolved to sit for a portrait .
this he had painted by a very gifted scotsman named cosmo alexander , then a resident of newport , and since famous as the early teacher of gilbert stuart .
the likeness was said to have been executed on a of the library of the house in olney court , but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition .
at this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction , and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the pawtuxet road .
he seemed , as was stated , in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense ; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery .
chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part , for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject .
his affectation of civic interest did not diminish , and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as stephen hopkins , joseph brown , and benjamin west in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town , which was then much below the level of newport in its patronage of the liberal arts .
he had helped daniel jenckes found his bookshop in , and was thereafter his best customer ; extending aid likewise to the struggling gazette that appeared each wednesday at the sign of shakespeare head .
in politics he ardently supported governor hopkins against the ward party whose prime strength was in newport , and his really eloquent speech at hacher hall in against the setting off of north providence as a separate town with a vote in the general assembly did more than any other thing to wear down the prejudice against him .
but ezra weeden , who watched him closely , sneered cynically at all this outward activity ; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of tartarus .
the revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port ; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the curwen warehouses , and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay .
he also kept as close a watch as possible on the pawtuxet farm , and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old indian couple loosed upon him .
in came the final change in joseph curwen .
it was very sudden , and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk ; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak , giving instant place to an exaltation of perfect triumph .
curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made ; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing , for no explanation was ever offered by him .
it was after this transition , which appears to have come early in july , that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their ancestors would seem to be able to impart .
but curwen feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change .
on the contrary , they tended rather to increase ; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been .
he altogether abandoned the slave trade , alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing .
every possible moment was spent at the pawtuxet farm ; although there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which , though not actually near graveyards , were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchant change of habits really was .
ezra weeden , though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging , had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked ; and subjected curwen affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before .
many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchant vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times , when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the sugar act which hampered a prominent traffick .
smuggling and evasion were the rule in narragansett bay , and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces .
but weeden , night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the curwen warehouses at the town street docks , soon felt assured that it was not merely his majesty armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid .
prior to the change in these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes , who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of pawtuxet ; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the curwen farm , where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only five high narrow slits for windows .
after that change , however , the whole programme was altered .
importation of slaves ceased at once , and for a time curwen abandoned his midnight sailings .
then , about the spring of , a new policy appeared .
once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black , silent docks , and this time they would go down the bay some distance , perhaps as far as namquit point , where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance .
curwen sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore , and transport it overland to the farm ; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes .
the cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases , of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins .
weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity ; visiting it each night for long periods , and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a snow .
even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left .
finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties , he hired a tavern companion named eleazar smith to continue the survey during his absence ; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours .
that they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible .
instead , they wished to learn something definite before taking any action .
what they did learn must have been startling indeed , and charles ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at weeden later burning of his notebooks .
all that can be told of their discoveries is what eleazar smith jotted down in a non too coherent diary , and what other diarists and have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace , of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension .
it is gathered that weeden and smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs , inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old indian and his wife , underlay the farm .
the house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and lattice windows , the laboratory being in a toward the north , where the roof came nearly to the ground .
this building stood clear of any other ; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within , it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath .
these voices , before , were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams , coupled with curious chants or invocations .
after that date , however , they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury , rumblings of conversations and whines of entreaty , pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest .
they appeared to be in different languages , all known to curwen , whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply , reproof , or threatening .
sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house ; curwen , certain captives , and the guards of those captives .
there were voices of a sort that neither weeden nor smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts , and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality .
the nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism , as if curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners .
weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook , for english , french , and spanish , which he knew , were frequently used ; but of these nothing has survived .
he did , however , say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of providence families were concerned , most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific ; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages .
once , for example , an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in french about the black prince massacre at limoges in , as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know .
curwen asked the prisoner if prisoner he were whether the order to slay was given because of the sign of the goat found on the altar in the ancient roman crypt beneath the cathedral , or whether the dark man of the haute vienne had spoken the three words .
failing to obtain replies , the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means ; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound .
none of these colloquies was ever ocularly witnessed , since the windows were always heavily draped .
once , though , during a discourse in an unknown tongue , a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled weeden exceedingly ; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of in hacher hall , when a man from germantown , pennsylvania , had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as ' a view of the famous city of jerusalem , in which are represented jerusalem , the temple of solomon , his royal throne , the noted towers , and hills , likewise the suffering of our saviour from the garden of gethsemane to the cross on the hill of golgotha ; an artful piece of statuary , worthy to be seen by the curious . '
it was on this occasion that the listener , who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded , gave a start which roused the old indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him .
after that no more conversations were ever heard in the house , and weeden and smith concluded that curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below .
that such regions in truth existed , seemed amply clear from many things .
faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure ; whilst hidden in the bushes along the in the rear , where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the pawtuxet , there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry , which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill .
when or how these catacombs could have been constructed , weeden was unable to say ; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river .
joseph curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed !
during the heavy spring rains of the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light , and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks .
naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm , and a locality where old indian were common , but weeden and smith drew their own inferences .
it was in january , whilst weeden and smith were still debating vainly on what , if anything , to think or do about the whole bewildering business , that the incident of the fortaleza occurred .
exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop liberty at newport during the previous summer , the customs fleet under admiral wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels ; and on this occasion his majesty armed schooner cygnet , under capt .
charles leslie , captured after a short pursuit one early morning the scow fortaleza of barcelona , spain , under capt .
manuel arruda , bound according to its log from grand cairo , egypt , to providence .
when searched for contraband material , this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of egyptian mummies , consigned to sailor a .
, who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off namquit point and whose identity capt .
arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal .
the at newport , at a loss what to do in view of the nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand , compromised on collector robinson recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in rhode island waters .
there were later rumours of its having been seen in boston harbour , though it never openly entered the port of boston .
this extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in providence , and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister joseph curwen .
his exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge , and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion ; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town .
as if conscious of this natural belief , curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies ; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural , yet stopping just short of admitting his participation .
weeden and smith , of course , felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing ; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning curwen and his monstrous labours .
the following spring , like that of the year before , had heavy rains ; and the watchers kept careful track of the behind the curwen farm .
large sections were washed away , and a certain number of bones discovered ; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows .
something was rumoured , however , at the village of pawtuxet about a mile below , where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placed landlocked cove .
there , where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge , and lay anchored at their sleepy docks , a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls .
of course the pawtuxet in a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards , and of course the spring rains had been very heavy ; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still waters below , or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cried out .
that rumour sent smith for weeden was just then at sea in haste to the behind the farm ; where surely enough there remained the evidence of an extensive .
there was , however , no trace of a passage into the steep bank ; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft .
smith went to the extent of some experimental digging , but was deterred by lack of success or perhaps by fear of possible success .
it is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time .
by the autumn of weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries ; for he had a large number of facts to link together , and a second to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy .
as his first confidant he selected capt .
james mathewson of the enterprise , who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity , and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect .
the colloquy took place in an upper room of sabin tavern near the docks , with smith present to corroborate virtually every statement ; and it could be seen that capt .
mathewson was tremendously impressed .
like nearly everyone else in the town , he had had black suspicions of his own anent joseph curwen ; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely .
at the end of the conference he was very grave , and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men .
he would , he said , transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of providence ; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer .
secrecy would probably be essential in any case , for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with ; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance , lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought curwen hither .
the right persons to tell , he believed , would be benjamin west , whose pamphlet on the late transit of venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker ; rev .
james manning , president of the college which had just moved up from warren and was temporarily housed in the new king street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above ; stephen hopkins , who had been a member of the philosophical society at newport , and was a man of very broad perceptions ; john carter , publisher of the gazette ; all four of the brown brothers , john , joseph , nicholas , and moses , who formed the recognised local magnates , and of whom joseph was an amateur scientist of parts ; old jabez bowen , whose erudition was considerable , and who had much knowledge of curwen odd purchases ; and capt .
abraham whipple , a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed .
these men , if favourable , might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation ; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the governor of the colony , joseph wanton of newport , before taking action .
the mission of capt .
mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations ; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of weeden tale , there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and coördinated action .
curwen , it was clear , formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and colony ; and must be eliminated at any cost .
late in december a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of stephen hopkins and debated tentative measures .
weeden notes , which he had given to capt .
mathewson , were carefully read ; and he and smith were summoned to give testimony anent details .
something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over , though there ran through that fear a grim determination which capt .
whipple bluff and resonant profanity best expressed .
they would not notify the governor , because a more than legal course seemed necessary .
with hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal , curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town .
nameless reprisals might ensue , and even if the sinister creature complied , the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place .
the times were lawless , and men who had flouted the king revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled .
curwen must be surprised at his pawtuxet farm by a large of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself .
if he proved a madman , amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices , he would be properly confined .
if something graver appeared , and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real , he and all with him must die .
it could be done quietly , and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about .
while these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around .
in the middle of a january night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window ; and people around weybosset point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the turk head .
there was a baying of dogs in the distance , but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible .
parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening , but nothing rewarded their search .
the next morning , however , a giant , muscular body , stark naked , was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the great bridge , where the long dock stretched out beside abbott , and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering .
it was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered , for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with eyes strike any chord of memory .
they , shaking as they did so , exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear ; for in those stiff , hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before .
ezra weeden was present at the finding ; and remembering the baying of the night before , set out along weybosset street and across muddy dock bridge whence the sound had come .
he had a curious expectancy , and was not surprised when , reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the pawtuxet road , he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow .
the naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men , and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced .
they had given up the chase upon coming too near the town .
weeden smiled grimly , and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source .
it was the pawtuxet farm of joseph curwen , as he well knew it would be ; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled .
as it was , he dared not seem too interested in full daylight .
bowen , to whom weeden went at once with his report , performed an autopsy on the strange corpse , and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly .
the digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use , whilst the whole skin had a coarse , loosely knit texture impossible to account for .
impressed by what the old men whispered of this body likeness to the blacksmith daniel green , whose aaron hoppin was a supercargo in curwen employ , weeden asked casual questions till he found where green was buried .
that night a party of ten visited the old north burying ground opposite herrenden lane and opened a grave .
they found it vacant , precisely as they had expected .
meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept joseph curwen mail , and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one jedediah orne of salem which made the coöperating citizens think deeply .
parts of it , copied and preserved in the private archives of the smith family where charles ward found it , ran as follows .
i delight that you continue in ye gett ' g at olde matters in your way , and doe not think better was done at hutchinson in .
certainely , there was noth ' g but ye liveliest awfulness in that which rais upp from what he cou gather onlie a part of .
what you sente , did not worke , whether because of any thing miss ' g , or because ye wordes were not righte from my speak ' g or yr copy ' g .
i alone am at a loss .
i have not ye chymicall art to followe borellus , and owne my self confounded by ye .

but i wou have you observe what was told to us aboute tak ' g care whom to calle upp , for you are sensible what mather writ in ye magnalia of , and can judge how truely that horrendous thing is reported .
i say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe ; by the which i meane , any that can in turne call up somewhat against you , whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use .
ask of the lesser , lest the greater shal not wish to answer , and shal commande more than you .
i was frighted when i read of your know ' g what ben zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony boxe , for i was conscious who must have tolde you .

i am desirous you will acquaint me with what ye black man learnt from sylvanus cocidius in ye vault , under ye roman wall , and will be oblig for ye lend ' g of ye you speak of .
another and unsigned letter from philadelphia provoked equal thought , especially for the following passage i will observe what you say respecting the sending of accounts only by yr vessels , but can not always be certain when to expect them .
in the matter spoke of , i require onlie one more thing ; but wish to be sure i apprehend you exactly .
you inform me , that no part must be missing if the finest effects are to be had , but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure .
it seems a great hazard and burthen to take away the whole box , and in town ( .
peter , paul , mary or christ church ) it can scarce be done at all .
but i know what imperfections were in the one i rais up october last , and how many live specimens you were forc to imploy before you hit upon the right mode in the year ; so will be guided by you in all matters .
i am impatient for yr brig , and inquire daily at biddle wharf .
a third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet .
in the smith diary found by charles ward a single combination of characters is clumsily copied ; and authorities at brown university have pronounced the alphabet amharic or abyssinian , although they do not recognise the word .
none of these epistles was ever delivered to curwen , though the disappearance of jedediah orne from salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the providence men took certain quiet steps .
the pennsylvania historical society also has some curious letters received by shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in philadelphia .
but more decisive steps were in the air , and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of weeden disclosures .
slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of joseph curwen noxious mysteries .
curwen , despite all precautions , apparently felt that something was in the wind ; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look .
his coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the pawtuxet road , and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the town prejudice .
the nearest neighbours to his farm , the fenners , one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high , excessively narrow windows ; an event which they quickly communicated to john brown in providence .
brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on curwen extirpation , and had informed the fenners that some action was about to be taken .
this he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid ; and he explained his course by saying that curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at newport , against whom the hand of every providence skipper , merchant , and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised .
whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain ; but at any rate the fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways .
to them brown had entrusted the duty of watching the curwen farmhouse , and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there .
the probability that curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things , as suggested by the odd shaft of light , precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens .
according to the smith diary a company of about men met at on friday , april , , in the great room of thurston tavern at the sign of the golden lion on weybosset point across the bridge .
of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader john brown there were present bowen , with his case of surgical instruments , president manning without the great periwig ( the largest in the colonies ) for which he was noted , governor hopkins , wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother esek , whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest , john carter , capt .
mathewson , and capt .
whipple , who was to lead the actual raiding party .
these chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber , after which capt .
whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions .
eleazar smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of ezra weeden , whose duty was to keep track of curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm .
about a heavy rumble was heard on the great bridge , followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside ; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry .
a moment later , as the receding coach clattered faintly over the muddy dock bridge , weeden appeared ; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street , shouldering the firelocks , , or whaling harpoons which they had with them .
weeden and smith were with the party , and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service capt .
whipple , the leader , capt .
esek hopkins , john carter , president manning , capt .
mathewson , and bowen ; together with moses brown , who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern .
all these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay , grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the muddy dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of broad street toward the pawtuxet road .
just beyond elder snow church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at providence lying outspread under the early spring stars .
steeples and gables rose dark and shapely , and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the bridge .
vega was climbing above the great hill across the water , whose crest of trees was broken by the of the unfinished college edifice .
at the foot of that hill , and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side , the old town dreamed ; old providence , for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out .
an hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived , as previously agreed , at the fenner farmhouse ; where they heard a final report on their intended victim .
he had reached his farm over half an hour before , and the strange light had soon afterward shot once more into the sky , but there were no lights in any visible windows .
this was always the case of late .
even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south , and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders .
capt .
whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions ; one of twenty men under eleazar smith to strike across to the shore and guard the against possible reinforcements for curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service , a second of twenty men under capt .
esek hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high , steep bank , and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves .
of this division one third was to be led by capt .
mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows , another third to follow capt .
whipple himself to the main farmhouse , and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal .
the river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single , then wait and capture anything which might issue from the regions within .
at the sound of two it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent .
the party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner ; forcing an entrance at the first , and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered , and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns .
a third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty ; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building .
capt .
whipple belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute , and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans .
he had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness , and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals .
the final reserve at the landing , of course , was nearly out of the whistle range ; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help .
moses brown and john carter went with capt .
hopkins to the , while president manning was detailed with capt .
mathewson to the stone building .
bowen , with ezra weeden , remained in capt .
whipple party which was to storm the farmhouse itself .
the attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from capt .
hopkins had joined capt .
whipple to notify him of the river party readiness .
the leader would then deliver the loud single blast , and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points .
shortly before the three divisions left the fenner farmhouse ; one to guard the landing , another to seek the river valley and the hillside door , and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the curwen farm .
eleazar smith , who accompanied the party , records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay ; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction .
later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots , and still later smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air .
it was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the night doings or of him who had been joseph curwen .
something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed ; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them , there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart .
it was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror .
most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable .
they had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures , and could not forget it .
from them there was never any gossip , for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries .
and from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips .
very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them , and eleazar smith diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the sign of the golden lion under the stars .
charles ward , however , discovered another vague sidelight in some fenner correspondence which he found in new london , where he knew another branch of the family had lived .
it seems that the fenners , from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible , had watched the departing columns of raiders ; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the curwen dogs , followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack .
this blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building , and in another moment , after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion , there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent luke fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters . '
this cry , however , had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey , and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound .
it was later repeated less loudly , and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued ; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river .
about an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully , and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece .
a strong smell of sulphur was noted ; and luke fenner father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal , though the others failed to detect it .
muffled musketry sounded again , followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it ; a kind of throaty , nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value .
then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the curwen farm ought to lie , and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard .
muskets flashed and cracked , and the flaming thing fell to the ground .
a second flaming thing appeared , and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished .
fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy almighty , protect thy lamb !
then there were more shots , and the second flaming thing fell .
after that came silence for about of an hour ; at the end of which time little arthur fenner , luke brother , exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance .
no one but the child can testify to this , but luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room .
five minutes later a chill wind blew up , and the air became suffused with an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being notice by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in the pawtuxet village .
this stench was nothing which any of the fenners had ever encountered before , and produced a kind of clutching , amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the .
close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget .
it thundered out of the sky like a doom , and windows rattled as its echoes died away .
it was deep and musical ; powerful as a bass organ , but evil as the forbidden books of the arabs .
what it said no man can tell , for it spoke in an unknown tongue , but this is the writing luke fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations . '
not till the year did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge , but charles ward paled as he recognised what mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magic incantations .
an unmistakable human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the curwen farm , after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable .
a wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out , and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms .
at times it became almost articulate , though no auditor could trace any definite words ; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter .
then a yell of utter , ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst ; after which darkness and silence ruled all things .
spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars , though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day .
toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the fenner door and requested a keg of rum , for which they paid very well indeed .
one of them told the family that the affair of joseph curwen was over , and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again .
arrogant as the order seemed , the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority ; so that only these furtive letters of luke fenner , which he urged his connecticut relative to destroy , remain to tell what was seen and heard .
the of that relative , whereby the letters were saved after all , has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion .
charles ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions .
old charles slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred , distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of joseph curwen was announced .
what kept the talk alive was the notion that this body , so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition , was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about .
not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it , and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party .
there is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter .
eight sailors had been killed , but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred .
the same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds , all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by jabez bowen , who had accompanied the party .
hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders , a thing which was discussed for weeks .
of the citizen leaders , capt .
whipple and moses brown were most severely hurt , and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced .
psychologically every participant was aged , sobered , and shaken .
it is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple , orthodox religionists , for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed .
president manning was the most disturbed ; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow , and smothered memories in prayers .
every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years , and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so .
little more than a twelvemonth afterward capt .
whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship gaspee , and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images .
there was delivered to the widow of joseph curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design , obviously found ready on the spot when needed , in which she was told her husband body lay .
he had , it was explained , been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details .
more than this no tongue ever uttered of joseph curwen end , and charles ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory .
this hint was the merest thread a shaky underscoring of a passage in jedediah orne confiscated letter to curwen , as partly copied in ezra weeden handwriting .
the copy was found in the possession of smith descendants ; and we are left to decide whether weeden gave it to his companion after the end , as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred , or whether , as is more probable , smith had it before , and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit .
the underlined passage is merely this i say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe ; by the which i meane , any that can in turne call up somewhat against you , whereby your powerfullest devices may not be of use .
ask of the lesser , lest the greater shal not wish to answer , and shal commande more than you .
in the light of this passage , and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity , charles ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of providence killed joseph curwen .
the deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders .
they had not at first meant to be so thorough , and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions ; but capt .
tillinghast was an astute man , and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that the daughter and granddaughter change their name , burn the library and all remaining papers , and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above joseph curwen grave .
he knew capt .
whipple well , and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner and anyone else ever gained repecting the end of the accursed sorcerer .
from that time on the obliteration of curwen memory became increasingly rigid , extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the gazette .
it can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on oscar wilde name for a decade after his disgrace , and in extent only to the fate of that sinful king of runazar in lord dunsany tale , whom the gods decided must not only cease to be , but must cease ever to have been .
tillinghast , as the widow became known after , sold the house in olney court and resided with her father in power lane till her death in .
the farm at pawtuxet , shunned by every living soul , remained to moulder through the years ; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity .
by only the stone and brickwork were standing , and by even these had fallen to shapeless heaps .
none ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the behind which the hillside door may have lain , nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which joseph curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought .
only robust old capt .
whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself , pox on that , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed .
was as though the damn had up his sleeve .
for half a crown i burn his home .
.
a search and an evocation charles ward , as we have seen , first learned in of his descent from joseph curwen .
that he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at ; for every vague rumour that he had heard of curwen now became something vital to himself , in whom flowed curwen blood .
no spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of curwen data .
in his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy ; so that even lyman hesitates to date the youth madness from any period before the close of .
he talked freely with his family though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like curwen and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited .
in applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object , and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and were regarded .
he often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at the pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find , and what joseph curwen really had been .
when he came across the smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from jedediah orne he decided to visit salem and look up curwen early activities and connexions there , which he did during the easter vacation of .
at the essex institute , which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs , he was very kindly received , and unearthed there a considerable amount of curwen data .
he found that his ancestor was born in , now danvers , seven miles from town , on the eighteenth of february ( . )
; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen , not appearing again for nine years , when he returned with the speech , dress , and manners of a native englishman and settled in salem proper .
at that time he had little to do with his family , but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from europe , and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from england , france , and holland .
certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness , and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night .
curwen only close friends had been one edward hutchinson of and one simon orne of salem .
with these men he was often seen in conference about the common , and visits among them were by no means infrequent .
hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods , and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night .
he was said to entertain strange visitors , and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour .
the knowledge he displayed concerning persons and events was considered distinctly unwholesome , and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began , never to be heard from again .
at that time joseph curwen also departed , but his settlement in providence was soon learned of .
simon orne lived in salem until , when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention .
he thereafter disappeared , though thirty years later his precise counterpart and son turned up to claim his property .
the claim was allowed on the strength of documents in simon orne known hand , and jedediah orne continued to dwell in salem till , when certain letters from providence citizens to the rev .
thomas barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown .
certain documents by and about all of the strange characters were available at the essex institute , the court house , and the registry of deeds , and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale , and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature .
there were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records ; as when one hepzibah lawson swore on july , , at the court of oyer and terminer under judge hathorne , that witches and the blacke man were wont to meete in the woodes behind hutchinson house ' , and one amity how declared at a session of august before judge gedney that .
b .
( rev .
george burroughs ) on that nighte putt ye divell his marke upon bridget , jonathan , simon , deliverance , joseph , susan , mehitable , and deborah b . '
then there was a catalogue of hutchinson uncanny library as found after his disappearance , and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting , couched in a cipher none could read .
ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made , and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him .
after the following august his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish , and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before october or november .
he never stated , though , whether or not he had succeeded .
but of greatest immediate interest was the orne material .
it took ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to curwen ; namely , that simon orne and his supposed son were one and the same person .
as orne had said to his correspondent , it was hardly safe to live too long in salem , hence he resorted to a sojourn abroad , and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation .
orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence , but the citizens who took action in found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder .
there were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which ward now either copied with care or had photographed , and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the registry of deeds as positively joseph curwen .
this curwen letter , though undated as to the year , was evidently not the one in answer to which orne had written the confiscated missive ; and from internal evidence ward placed it not much later than .
it may not be amiss to give the text in full , as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible .
the recipient is addressed as simon , but a line ( whether drawn by curwen or orne ward could not tell ) is run through the word .

this letter , oddly enough , was what first gave ward the exact location of curwen providence home ; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific .
the discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer curwen house , built in on the site of the old , a dilapidated building still standing in olney court and well known to ward in his antiquarian rambles over stampers ' hill .
the place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hill higher ground , and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing , housecleaning , and services .
to find , in distant salem , such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history , was a highly impressive thing to ward ; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return .
the more mystical phases of the letter , which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism , frankly baffled him ; though he noted with a thrill of curiousity that the biblical passage referred to job was the familiar verse , a man die , shall he live again ?
all the days of my appointed time will i wait , until my change come . '
young ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement , and spent the following saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in olney court .
the place , now crumbling with age , had never been a mansion ; but was a modest story wooden town house of the familiar providence colonial type , with plain peaked roof , large central chimney , and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight , triangular pediment , and trim doric pilasters .
it had suffered but little alteration externally , and ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest .
the present negro inhabitants were known to him , and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old asa and his stout wife hannah .
here there was more change than the outside indicated , and ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine overmantels and cupboard linings were gone , whilst most of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked , hacked , and gouged , or covered up altogether with cheap .
in general , the survey did not yield as much as ward had somehow expected ; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as joseph curwen .
he saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker .
from then until after the close of school ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local curwen data .
the former still proved unyielding ; but of the latter he obtained so much , and so many clues to similar data elsewhere , that he was ready by july to make a trip to new london and new york to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated .
this trip was very fruitful , for it brought him the fenner letters with their terrible description of the pawtuxet farmhouse raid , and the letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the curwen library .
this matter of the portrait interested him particularly , since he would have given much to know just what joseph curwen looked like ; and he decided to make a second search of the house in olney court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy .
early in august that search took place , and ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder .
he paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained ; and was keenly excited after about an hour , when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been .
a few more careful tests with a thin knife , and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent .
with truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have been , but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help .
in three days he returned with an artist of long experience , walter dwight , whose studio is near the foot of college hill ; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances .
old asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors , and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth .
as day by the day the work of restoration progressed , charles ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion .
dwight had begun at the bottom ; hence since the picture was a one , the face did not come out for some time .
it was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare , man with coat , embroidered waistcoat , black satin , and white silk stockings , seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond .
when the head came out it was observed to bear a neat albemarle wig , and to possess a thin , calm , undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both ward and the artist .
only at the very last , though , did the restorer and his client begin to grasp with astonishment at the details of that lean , pallid visage , and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played .
for it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden ; and to confront the bewildered charles dexter ward , dweller in the past , with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible .
ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered , and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling .
the resemblance to the boy , despite an appearance of rather great age , was marvellous ; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of joseph curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half .
ward resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked , though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone curwen .
she did not relish the discovery , and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home .
there was , she averred , something unwholesome about it ; not only intrinsically , but in its very resemblance to charles .
ward , however , was a practical man of power and affairs a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at riverpoint in the pawtuxet valley and not one to listen to feminine scruples .
the picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son , and he believed the boy deserved it as a present .
in this opinion , it is needless to say , charles most heartily concurred ; and a few days later ward located the owner of the house a small person with a guttural accent and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed price which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling .
it now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the ward home , where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric in charles study or library .
to charles was left the task of superintending this removal , and on the of august he accompanied two expert workmen from the crooker decorating firm to the house in olney court , where the mantel and overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the company motor truck .
there was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimney course , and in this young ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square , which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait .
curious as to what such a space might mean or contain , the youth approached and looked within ; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers , a crude , thick copybook , and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together .
blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders , he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover .
it was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the essex institute , and proclaimed the volume as the and notes of jos curwen , gent .
of , late of salem . '
excited beyond measure by his discovery , ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him .
their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding , and willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities .
all the other papers were likewise in curwen handwriting , and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription him who shal come after , how he may gett beyonde time ye spheres . '
another was in a cipher ; the same , ward hoped , as the hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him .
a third , and here the searcher rejoiced , seemed to be a key to the cipher ; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to hutchinson , armiger ' and orne , esq .
' , their heir or heirs , or those represent ' g them . '
the sixth and last was inscribed curwen his life and travells ye yeares and of whither he voyag , where he stay , whom he sawe , and what he learnt . '
we have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date charles ward madness .
upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts , and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously .
indeed , in shewing the titles to the workmen , he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care , and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account .
upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air , as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself .
he did not even shew the titles to his parents , but simply told them that he had found some documents in joseph curwen handwriting , in cipher ' , which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning .
it is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen , had it not been for their unconcealed curiousity .
as it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter .
that night charles ward sat up in his room reading the book and papers , and when day came he did not desist .
his meals , on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss , were sent up to him ; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study .
the next night he slept in snatches in his clothes , meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript .
in the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the hutchinson cipher , which he had frequently shewn her before ; but in response to her query he said that the curwen key could not be applied to it .
that afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log , setting the and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed , and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the room .
the front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it .
after the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a and mirror .
his parents , subsequently recalling his conduct at this period , give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practised .
before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might by studying , since he rightly assumed that curwen intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them .
with his parents , however , he was more circumspect ; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher , or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs ( as that entitled him who shal come after , etc . '
seemed to be ) , he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed .
at night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his , where he also placed them whenever he left the room .
he soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits , except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease .
the opening of school , where he now began his senior year , seemed a great bore to him ; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college .
he had , he said , important special investigations to make , which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast .
naturally , only one who had always been more or less studious , eccentric , and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice .
ward , however , was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit ; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted .
at the same time , both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his , nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered .
this reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation , but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint ; intensified in his mother case by her manifest disapproval of all curwen delvings .
during october ward began visiting the libraries again , but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days .
witchcraft and magic , occultism and daemonology , were what he sought now ; and when providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for boston and tap the wealth of the great library in copley square , the widener library at harvard , or the zion research library in brookline , where certain rare works on biblical subjects are available .
he bought extensively , and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects ; while during the christmas holidays he made a round of trips including one to salem to consult certain records at the essex institute .
about the middle of january , , there entered ward bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain , and he was no more found at work upon the hutchinson cipher .
instead , he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and ; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house , and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in providence .
local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies , later questioned , gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased ; but clerks at the state house , the city hall , and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest .
he was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of joseph curwen , from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name .
little by little there grew upon the ward family the conviction that something was wrong .
charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before , but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him .
his school work was the merest pretence ; and although he failed in no test , it could be seen that the older application had all vanished .
he had other concernments now ; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books , could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study , where the startlingly one almost fancied increasingly similar features of joseph curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall .
late in march ward added to his a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city .
the cause appeared later , when it was learned from city hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue .
his quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of joseph curwen to that of one naphthali field ; and this shift was explained when , upon going over the files that he had been over , the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of curwen burial which had escaped the general obliteration , and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred and of naphthali field grave in . '
the lack of a specified in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search , and naphthali field grave seemed as elusive as that of curwen ; but here no systematic effacement had existed , and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished .
hence the rambles from which john ( the former king ) churchyard and the ancient congregational in the midst of swan point cemetery were excluded , since other statistics had shewn that the only naphthali field ( obiit ) whose grave could have been meant had been a baptist .
it was toward may when willett , at the request of the senior ward , and fortified with all the curwen data which the family had gleaned from charles in his days , talked with the young man .
the interview was of little value or conclusiveness , for willett felt at every moment that charles was thorough master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance ; but it at least force the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour .
of a pallid , impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment , ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits , though not to reveal their object .
he stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge , for the most part in cipher , of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of friar bacon and perhaps surpassing even those .
they were , however , meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete ; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance .
to take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved , and to this task of correlation ward was now devoting himself .
he was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the curwen data must possess , and hoped in time to made a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought .
not even einstein , he declared , could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things .
as to his graveyard search , whose object he freely admitted , but the details of whose progress he did not relate , he said he had reason to think that joseph curwen mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system .
curwen , he believed , had wish to guard his secret with care ; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion .
when willett asked to see the mystic documents , ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the hutchinson cipher and orne formulae and diagrams ; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real curwen finds the and notes ' , the cipher ( title in cipher also ) , and the message him who shal come after ' and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters .
he also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave willett a glimpse of curwen connected handwriting in english .
the doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters , and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writer survival into the eighteenth century , and became quickly certain that the document was genuine .
the text itself was relatively trivial , and willett recalled only a fragment .

when upon reaching this point willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by ward , who almost snatched the book from his grasp .
all that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences ; but these , strangely enough , lingered tenacious in his memory .
they ran verse from be ' g spoke v roodmasses and , i am hopeful ye thing is breed ' g outside ye spheres .
it will drawe one who is to come , if i can make sure he shal bee , and he shal think on past thinges and look back thro ' all ye yeares , against ye which i must have ready ye saltes or that to make with . '
willett saw no more , but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of joseph curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel .
even after that he entertained the odd fancy which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish , if not an actual tendency , to follow young charles ward as he move about the room .
he stopped before leaving to study the picture closely , marvelling at its resemblance to charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical , colourless face , even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye .
cosmo alexander , he decided , was a painter worthy of the scotland that produced raeburn , and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil gilbert stuart .
assured by the doctor that charles mental health was in no danger , but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance , the wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following june the youth made positive his refusal to attend college .
he had , he declared , studies of much more vital importance to pursue ; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in america .
the senior ward , while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen , acquiesced regarding the university ; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the moses brown school there ensued for charles a period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching .
he became recognised as an eccentric , and dropped even more completely from the sight of his family friends than he had been before ; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records .
once he went south to talk to a strange mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper hand printed a curious article .
again he sought a small village in the adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come .
but still his parents forbade him the trip to the old world which he desired .
coming of age in april , , and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather , ward determined at last to take the european trip hitherto denied him .
of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places , but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully .
when they saw he could not be dissuaded , they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could ; so that in june the young man sailed for liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother , who accompanied him to boston and waved him out of sight from the white star pier in charlestown .
letters soon told of his safe arrival , and of his securing good quarters in great russell street , london ; where he proposed to stay , shunning all family friends , till he had exhausted the resources of the british museum in a certain direction .
of his daily life he wrote by little , for there was little to write .
study and experiment consumed all his time , and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms .
that he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise , was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind .
in june , , a brief note told of his departure for paris , to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the bibliothèque nationale .
for three months thereafter he sent only postal cards , giving an address in the rue jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector .
he avoided acquaintances , and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him .
then came a silence , and in october the wards received a picture card from prague , , stating that charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information .
he gave an address in the neustadt , and announced no move till the following january ; when he dropped several cards from vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and into the occult had invited him .
the next card was from klausenburg in transylvania , and told of ward progress toward his destination .
he was going to visit a baron ferenczy , whose estate lay in the mountains east of rakus ; and was to be addressed at rakus in the care of that nobleman .
another card from rakus a week later , saying that his host carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains , was his last message for a considerable time ; indeed , he did reply to his parents ' frequent letters until may , when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in london , paris , or rome during the summer , when the elder wards were planning to travel to europe .
his researches , he said , were such that he could not leave his present quarters ; while the situation of baron ferenczy castle did not favour visits .
it was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains , and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease .
moreover , the baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative new england gentlefolk .
his aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies , and his age was so great as to be disquieting .
it would be better , charles said , if his parents would wait for his return to providence ; which could scarcely be far distant .
that return did not , however , take place until may , when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into new york on the homeric and traversed the long miles to providence by , eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills , and fragrant , blossoming orchards , and the white steepled towns of vernal connecticut ; his first taste of ancient new england in nearly four years .
when the coach crossed the pawcatuck and entered rhode island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force , and the entry to providence along reservoir and elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved .
at the high square where broad , weybosset , and empire streets join , he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant , remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town ; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down to the terminal behind the biltmore , bringing into view the great dome and soft , greenery of the ancient hill across the river , and the tall colonial spire of the first baptist church limned pink in the magic evening against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background .
old providence !
it was this place and the mysterious forces of its long , continuous history which had brought him into being , and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix .
here lay the arcana , wondrous or dreadful as the case may be , for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him .
a taxicab whirled him through post office square with its glimpse of the river , the old market house , and the head of the bay , and up the steep curved slope of waterman street to prospect , where the vast gleaming dome and ionic columns of the christian science church beckoned northward .
then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known , and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet .
and at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right , on the left the classic adam porch and stately facade of the great brick house where he was born .
it was twilight , and charles dexter ward had come home .
a school of alienists slightly less academic than lyman assign to ward european trip the beginning of his true madness .
admitting that he was sane when he started , they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change .
but even to this claim willett refuses to concede .
there was , he insists , something later ; and the queerness of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad odd enough things , to be sure , but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant .
ward himself , though visibly aged and hardened , was still normal in his general reactions ; and in several talks with willett displayed a balance which no madman even an incipient one could feign continuously for long .
what elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from ward attic laboratory , in which he kept himself most of the time .
there were chantings and repetitions , and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms ; and although these sounds were always in ward own voice , there was something in the quality of that voice , and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced , which could not by chill the blood of every hearer .
it was noticed that nig , the venerable and beloved black cat of the household , bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard .
the odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange .
sometimes they were very noxious , but more often they were aromatic , with a haunting , elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images .
people who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas , with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance .
ward did not resume his rambles , but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home , and to equally strange delvings within his quarters ; explaining that european sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work , and promising great revelations in the years to come .
his older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the curwen portrait in his library ; and willett would often pause by the latter after a call , marvelling at the virtual identity , and reflecting that only the small pit above the picture right eye now remained to differentiate the wizard from the living youth .
these calls of willett , undertaken at the request of the senior wards , were curious affairs .
ward at no time repulsed the doctor , but the latter saw that he could never reach the young man inner psychology .
frequently he noted peculiar things about ; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables , and the remnants of circles , triangles , and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room .
and always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered , till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of charles madness .
in january , , a peculiar incident occurred .
one night about midnight , as charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below , there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay , and a faint , obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted .
at the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright , while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around .
this was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm , anomalous for the season , which brought with it such a crash that and ward believed the house had been struck .
they rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done , but charles met them at the door to the attic ; pale , resolute , and portentous , with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face .
he assured them that the house had not really been struck , and that the storm would soon be over .
they paused , and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right ; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off , whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water .
the thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away .
stars came out , and the stamp of triumph on charles ward face crystallised into a very singular expression .
for two months or more after this incident ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory .
he exhibited a curious interest in the weather , and made odd inquires about the date of the spring thawing of the ground .
one night late in march he left the house after midnight , and did not return till almost morning ; when his mother , being wakeful , heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance .
muffled oaths could be distinguished , and ward , rising and going to the window , saw four dark figures removing a long , heavy box from a truck at charles direction and carrying it within by the side door .
she heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs , and finally a dull thumping in the attic ; after which the footfalls descended again , and the four reappeared outside and drove off in their truck .
the next day charles resumed his strict attic seclusion , drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance .
he would open the door to no one , and steadfastly refused all proffered food .
about noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard , but when ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly , and told her that nothing had gone amiss .
the hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary .
solitude was the one prime essential , and he would appear later for dinner .
that afternoon , after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal , he did finally appear ; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext .
this , indeed , proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy ; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out , furnished roughly , and added to his inviolable private domain as a sleeping apartment .
here he lived , with books brought up from his library beneath , till the time he purchased the pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects .
in the evening charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident .
later on willett , having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household , looked up an intact copy at the journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred nocturnal diggers surprised in north burial ground robert hart , night watchman at the north burial ground , this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery , but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been .
the discovery took place at about four , when hart attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter .
investigating , he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away ; but could not reach it before the noise of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach .
the men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken ; and since no known grave was disturbed , hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury .
the diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection , for hart found an enormous hold dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of amasa field , where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared .
the hole , a place as large and deep as a grave , was empty ; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records .
sergt .
riley of the second station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed .
in reply to questions hart said he though the escaping truck had headed up rochambeau avenue , though he could not be sure .
during the next few days charles ward was seldom seen by his family .
having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm , he kept closely to himself there , ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away .
the droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals , while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass , hissing chemicals , running water , or roaring gas flames .
odours of the most unplaceable quality , wholly unlike any before noted , hung at times around the door ; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation .
once he made a hasty trip to the athenaeum for a book he required , and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from boston .
suspense was written portentously over the whole situation , and both the family and willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it .
then on the fifteenth of april a strange development occurred .
while nothing appeared to grow different in kind , there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree ; and willett somehow attaches great significance to the change .
the day was good friday , a circumstance of which the servants made much , but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence .
late in the afternoon young ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice , at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house .
the formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously , and later on she was able to write it down at willett request .
it ran as follows , and experts have told willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of eliphas levi , that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond adonai eloim , adonai jehova , adonai sabaoth , metraton on agla mathon , verbum pythonicum , mysterium salamandrae , conventus sylvorum , antra gnomorum , daemonia coeli gad , almonsin , gibor , jehosua , evam , zariatnatmik , veni , veni , veni . '
this had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in .
the extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day , but to those in the ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it ; a hideous , odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since .
in the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning , which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around ; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness , its incredible depth , and its eldritch dissimilarity to charles ward voice .
it shook the house , and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs .
ward , who had been listening in despair outside her son locked laboratory , shivered as she recognised its hellish imports ; for charles had told of its evil fame in dark books , and of the manner in which it had thundered , according to the fenner letter , above the doomed pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of joseph curwen annihilation .
there was no mistaking that nightmare phrase , for charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his curwen investigations .
and yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language . '
close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight , though sunset was still an hour distant , and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable .
charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like nash yog sothoth he lgeb throdog ' ending in a ! '
whose maniacal force mounted in an crescendo .
a second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter .
ward , with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity , advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels , but obtained no sign of recognition .
she knocked again , but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose , this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son , and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice .
presently she fainted , although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause .
memory sometimes makes merciful deletions .
ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six ; and not finding his wife downstairs , was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at charles door , from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before .
mounting the stairs at once , he saw ward stretched out at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory ; and realising that she had fainted , hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove .
dashing the cold fluid in her face , he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part , and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging .
for the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be , but held the murmurs of a tense , muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension , yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul .
it was not , of course , new for charles to mutter formulae ; but this muttering was definitely different .
it was so palpably a dialogue , or imitation of a dialogue , with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer , statement and response .
one voice was undisguisedly that of charles , but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youth best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before .
there was something hideous , blasphemous , and abnormal about it , and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that theodore howland ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted .
as it was , he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him .
even so , however , he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden .
for ward cry had evidently been heard by others than he , and there had come in response to it from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded .
they were merely an excited caution in charles own voice , but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them .
the phrase was just this ! write ! '
and ward conferred at some length after dinner , and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with charles that very night .
no matter how important the object , such conduct could no longer be permitted ; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous of the entire household .
the youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses , since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth .
all this must be stopped , or ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility .
ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for charles laboratory .
on the third floor , however , he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son .
books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled , and upon stepping to the door ward beheld the youth within , excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape .
charles aspect was very drawn and haggard , and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his father voice .
at the elder man command he sat down , and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved .
there was no scene .
at the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right , and that his noises , mutterings , incantations , and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances .
he agreed to a policy of great quiet , though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy .
much of his future work , he said , was in any case purely book research ; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage .
for the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition , and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere .
his use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered ward , but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity .
the interview was really quite inconclusive , and as charles picked up his armful and left the room ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business .
it was as mysterious as the death of poor old nig , whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement , with staring eyes and mouth .
driven by some vague detective instinct , the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic .
the youth library was plainly and rigidly classified , so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn .
on this occasion ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian , beyond what had been previously removed , was missing .
these new withdrawals were all modern items ; histories , scientific treatises , geographies , manuals of literature , philosophic works , and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines .
it was a very curious shift from charles ward recent run of reading , and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness .
the strangeness was a very poignant sensation , and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him .
something was indeed wrong , and tangibly as well as spiritually so .
ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss , and at last it dawned upon him what it was .
on the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in olney court , but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large curwen portrait disaster had come .
time and unequal heating had done their work at last , and at some time since the room last cleaning the worst had happened .
peeling clear of the wood , curling tighter and tighter , and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness , the portrait of joseph curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled , and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine dust .
.
a mutation and a madness in the week following that memorable good friday charles ward was seen more often than usual , and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory .
his actions were quiet and rational , but he had a furtive , hunted look which his mother did not like , and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook .
willett had been told of those friday noises and happenings , and on the following tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more .
the interview was , as always , inconclusive ; but willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time .
he held out promises of an early revelation , and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere .
at the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it , but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling .
about the second week charles began to be absent from the house for long periods , and one day when good old black hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in olney court , where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar .
he was always very liberal to her and to old asa , but seemed more worried than he used to be ; which grieved her very much , since she had watched him grow up from birth .
another report of his doings came from pawtuxet , where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times .
he seemed to haunt the resort and of , and subsequent inquiries by willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather , along which he would walk toward the north , usually not reappearing for a very long while .
late in may came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from charles .
it occurred one morning , and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent good friday .
the youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself , for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused ward to run upstairs and listen at the door .
she could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were have it red for three months ' , and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once .
when charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid , but which he would try to transfer to other realms .
about the middle of june a queer nocturnal incident occurred .
in the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs , and ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down .
that midnight , after the family had retired , the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress .
the youth spoke no word , but the worthy yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly .
he opened the door and young ward went out , but in the morning he presented his resignation to ward .
there was , he said , something unholy in the glance charles had fixed on him .
it was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person , and he could not possibly stay another night .
ward allowed the man to depart , but she did not value his statement highly .
to fancy charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous , for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above ; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing , and of a sighing which told only of despair profoundest depths .
ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night , for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind .
the next evening , much as on another evening nearly three months before , charles ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section .
this matter was not recalled till later , when willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there .
in the journal office he found the section which charles had lost , and marked two items as of possible significance .
they were as follows more cemetery delving it was this morning discovered by robert hart , night watchman at the north burial ground , that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery .
the grave of ezra weeden , who was born in and died in according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone , was found excavated and rifled , the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent .
whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial , all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood .
there were no wheel tracks , but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity , and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement .
hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last march , when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation ; but sergt .
riley of the second station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases .
in march the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known ; but this time a and grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose , and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before .
members of the weeden family , notified of the happening , expressed their astonishment and regret ; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor .
hazard weeden of angell street recalls a family legend according to which ezra weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances , not dishonourable to himself , shortly before the revolution ; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant .
inspector cunningham has been assigned to the case , and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future .
dogs noisy in pawtuxet residents of pawtuxet were aroused about today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of .
the volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd , according to most who heard it ; and fred lemdin , night watchman at rhodes , declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony .
a sharp and very brief thunderstorm , which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river , put an end to the disturbance .
strange and unpleasant odours , probably from the oil tanks along the bay , are popularly linked with this incident ; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs .
the aspect of charles now became very haggard and hunted , and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him .
the morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness , and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time , but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator .
these cases , too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention , involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities ; the residential hill and the north end , near the ward home , and the suburban districts across the cranston line near pawtuxet .
both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked , and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean , lithe , leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously .
willett , who refuses to date the madness of charles ward as far back as even this , is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors .
he has , he declares , certain theories of his own ; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation ' i will not , ' he says , who or what i believe perpetrated these attacks and murders , but i will declare that charles ward was innocent of them .
i have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood , as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument .
ward meddled with terrible things , but he has paid for it , and he was never a monster or a villain .
as for now i do like to think .
a change came , and i content to believe that the old charles ward died with it .
his soul did , anyhow , for that mad flesh that vanished from waite hospital had another . '
willett speaks with authority , for he was often at the ward home attending ward , whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain .
her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy , and which he ridiculed in talking to her , although they made him ponder deeply when alone .
these delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom , and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times .
early in july willett ordered ward to atlantic city for an indefinite recuperative sojourn , and cautioned both ward and the haggard and elusive charles to write her only cheering letters .
it is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity .
not long after his mother departure , charles ward began negotiating for the pawtuxet bungalow .
it was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage , perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above rhodes , but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else .
he gave the agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner , and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness , , transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory , including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study .
he had this van loaded in the black small hours , and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away .
after that charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor , and never haunted the attic again .
to the pawtuxet bungalow charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm , save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries ; a portuguese from the south main waterfront who acted as a servant , and a thin , scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague .
neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation .
the mulatto gomes spoke very little english , and the bearded man , who gave his name as allen , voluntarily followed his example .
ward himself tried to be more affable , but succeeded only in provoking curiousity with his rambling accounts of chemical research .
before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the burning of lights ; and somewhat later , after this burning had suddenly ceased , there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butcher and of the muffled shouting , declamation , rhythmic chanting , and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place .
most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity , and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders ; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of edgewood .
ward spent most of his time at the bungalow , but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his father roof .
twice he was absent from the city on trips , whose destinations have not yet been discovered .
he grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before , and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to willett his old , old story of vital research and future revelations .
willett often waylaid him at his father house , for the elder ward was deeply worried and perplexed , and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult .
the doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this , and adduces many a conversation to prove his point .
about september the vampirism declined , but in the following january almost became involved in serious trouble .
for some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon , and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents .
in a lonely spot near hope valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylaying of trucks by in quest of liquor shipments , but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock .
for the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things ; so gruesome , in fact , that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld .
the thieves had hastily buried what they discovered , but when the state police got wind of the matter a careful search was made .
a recently arrived vagrant , under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge , at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot ; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing .
it would not be well for the national or even the international sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party .
there was no mistaking it , even by those far from studious officers ; and telegrams to washington ensued with feverish rapidity .
the cases were addressed to charles ward at his pawtuxet bungalow , and state and federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call .
they found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions , and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence .
he had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove , and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be .
of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing , and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce .
in this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague allen , whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones ; so that in the end the officials took no action , but carefully set down the new york name and address which ward gave them a basis for a search which came to nothing .
it is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places , and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance .
on february , , willett received a letter from charles ward which he considers of extraordinary importance , and about which he has frequently quarrelled with lyman .
lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a case of dementia praecox , but willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth .
he calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship ; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves , is nevertheless distinctly ward own .
the text in full is as follows prospect providence , , february , .
dear willett - i feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which i have so long promised you , and for which you have pressed me so often .
the patience you have shewn in waiting , and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity , are things i shall never cease to appreciate .
and now that i am ready to speak , i must own with humiliation that no triumph such as i dreamed of can ever be mine .
instead of triumph i have found terror , and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation .
you recall what those fenner letters said of the old raiding party at pawtuxet .
that must all be done again , and quickly .
upon us depends more than can be put into words all civilisation , all natural law , perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe .
i have brought to light a monstrous abnormality , but i did it for the sake of knowledge .
now for the sake of all life and nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again .
i have left that pawtuxet place forever , and we must extirpate everything existing there , alive or dead .
i shall not go there again , and you must not believe it if you ever hear that i am there .
i will tell you why i say this when i see you .
i have come home for good , and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what i have to say .
it will take that long and believe me when i tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this .
my life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balance .
i dare not tell my father , for he could not grasp the whole thing .
but i have told him of my danger , and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house .
i do know how much good they can do , for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge .
so come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell .
any time will do i shall not be out of the house .
do telephone ahead , for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you .
and let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting .
in utmost gravity and desperation , charles dexter ward .
.
shoot allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid .
do burn it .
willett received this note about , and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk , letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary .
he planned to arrive about four , and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed .
maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger , willett had seen too much of charles ward oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving .
that something very subtle , ancient , and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure , and the reference to allen could almost be comprehended in view of what pawtuxet gossip said of ward enigmatical colleague .
willett had never seen the man , but had heard much of his aspect and bearing , and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those dark glasses might conceal .
promptly at four willett presented himself at the ward residence , but found to his annoyance that charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors .
the guards were there , but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity .
he had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone , one of the detectives said , replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as ' i am very tired and must rest a while ' , ' i ca receive anyone for some time ' , have to excuse me ' , postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise ' , or ' i am very sorry , but i must take a complete vacation from everything ; i talk with you later . '
then , apparently gaining boldness through meditation , he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one and entered the house without a word .
he had gone upstairs , where a bit of his fear must have surged back ; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library , afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp .
when , however , the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was , he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness , and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably .
then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves , for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued ; after which he had reappeared and left at once .
willett inquired whether or not any message had been left , but was told that there was none .
the butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in charles appearance and manner , and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves .
for almost two hours willett waited vainly in charles ward library , watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed , and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall , whence a year before the suave features of old joseph curwen had looked mildly down .
after a time the shadows began to gather , and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew before the night .
ward finally arrived , and shewed much surprise and anger at his son absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him .
he had not known of charles appointment , and promised to notify willett when the youth returned .
in bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his son condition , and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise .
willett was glad to escape from that library , for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it ; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil .
he had never liked that picture ; and even now , though he was , there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible .
the next morning willett received a message from the senior ward , saying that charles was still absent .
ward mentioned that allen had telephoned him to say that charles would remain at pawtuxet for some time , and that he must not be disturbed .
this was necessary because allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period , leaving the researches in need of charles constant oversight .
charles sent his best wishes , and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused .
in listening to this message ward heard allen voice for the first time , and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed , but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness .
faced by these baffling and contradictory reports , willett was frankly at a loss what to do .
the frantic earnestness of charles note was not to be denied , yet what could one think of its writer immediate violation of his own expressed policy ?
young ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing , that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost , and that he himself would never return to their final scene ; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery .
common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness , yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside .
willett read it over again , and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply .
its terror was too profound and real , and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation .
there were nameless horrors abroad ; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them , one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time .
for over a week willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him , and became more and more inclined to pay charles a call at the pawtuxet bungalow .
no friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat , and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give ; but willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary .
ward had been receiving brief and typed notes from his son , and said that ward in her atlantic city retirement had had no better word .
so at length the doctor resolved to act ; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of joseph curwen , and by more recent revelations and warnings from charles ward , set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river .
willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiousity , though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence ; hence knew exactly the route to take .
driving out broad street one early afternoon toward the end of february in his small motor , he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend .
the ride through the city decaying fringe was short , and trim edgewood and sleepy pawtuxet presently spread out ahead .
willett turned to the right down lockwood street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could , then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond .
houses were still few here , and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left .
stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand , and spoke without a tremor to the evil portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack .
he must , he said , see charles ward at once on vitally important business .
no excuse would be accepted , and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder ward .
the mulatto still hesitated , and pushed against the door when willett attempted to open it ; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands .
then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it .
him in , tony , ' it said , may as well talk now as ever . '
but disturbing as was the whisper , the greater fear was that which immediately followed .
the floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than charles dexter ward .
the minuteness with which willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period .
for at last he concedes a vital change in charles dexter ward mentality , and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years .
controversy with lyman has compelled him to be very specific , and he definitely dates the madness of charles ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents .
those notes are not in ward normal style ; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to willett .
instead , they are strange and archaic , as if the snapping of the writer mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism .
there is an obvious effort to be modern , but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past .
the past , too , was evident in ward every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow .
he bowed , motioned willett to a seat , and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset .
' i am grown phthisical , ' he began , this cursed river air .
you must excuse my speech .
i suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me , and i hope you will say nothing to alarm him . '
willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care , but studying even more closely the face of the speaker .
something , he felt , was wrong ; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that yorkshire butler one night .
he wished it were not so dark , but did not request that the blind be opened .
instead , he merely asked ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before .
' i was coming to that , ' the host replied .
must know , i am in a very bad state of nerves , and do and say queer things i can not account for .
as i have told you often , i am on the edge of great matters ; and the bigness of them has a way of making me .
any man might well be frighted of what i have found , but i am not to be put off for long .
i was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home ; for having gone this far , my place is here .
i am not well spoke of by prying neighbours , and perhaps i was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me .
there is no evil to any in what i do , so long as i do it rightly .
have the goodness to wait six months , and i shew you what will pay your patience well .
may as well know i have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books , and i leave you to judge the importance of what i can give to history , philosophy , and the arts by reason of the doors i have access to .
my ancestor had all this when those witless peeping toms came and murdered him .
i now have it again , or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it .
this time nothing must happen , and least of all through any idiot fears of my own .
pray forget all i writ you , sir , and have no fear of this place or any in it .
allen is a man of fine parts , and i own him an apology for anything ill i have said of him .
i wish i had no need to spare him , but there were things he had to do elsewhere .
his zeal is equal to mine in all those matters , and i suppose that when i feared the work i feared him too as my greatest helper in it . '
ward paused , and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think .
he felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter ; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad , the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the charles ward he knew .
willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters , and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood ; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results .
it was the same with all the alienists later on .
important sections of charles ward store of mental images , mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life , had been unaccountably expunged ; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual .
the youth intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy , and he tried his best to hide it .
when willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess , and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by .
it was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriff wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in douglass histrionick academy in king street on the eleventh of february , , which fell on a thursday ; or about how the actors cut the text of steele conscious lover so badly that one was almost glad the legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later .
that thomas sabin boston coach was damn uncomfortable old letters may well have told ; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of epenetus olney new signboard ( the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the crown coffee house ) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in pawtuxet were playing ?
ward , however , would not be quizzed long in this vein .
modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily , whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom .
what he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning .
to this end he offered to shew willett the entire house , and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic .
willett looked sharply , but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial to have ever filled the wide gaps on ward shelves at home , and that the meagre laboratory was the flimsiest sort of a blind .
clearly , there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere ; but just where , it was impossible to say .
essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name , willett returned to town before evening and told the senior ward everything which had occurred .
they agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind , but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then .
above all , ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her son own strange typed notes would permit .
ward now determined to call in person upon his son , making it wholly a surprise visit .
willett took him in his car one evening , guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return .
the session was a long one , and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state .
his reception had developed much like willett , save that charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the portuguese away with an imperative demand ; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection .
the lights had been dim , yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously .
he had not spoken out loud at all , averring that his throat was in very poor condition ; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that ward could not banish it from his mind .
now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youth mental salvation , ward and willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford .
pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied , and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region .
willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure , and from all he heard he could tell that young ward life had become indeed a strange one .
common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer , while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculations .
local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the mulatto , and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood .
for a household of only three , these quantities were quite absurd .
then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth .
reports of these things were harder to pin down , but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials .
noises of a ritual nature positively existed , and at times when the bungalow was dark .
they might , of course , have come from the known cellar ; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts .
recalling the ancient tales of joseph curwen catacombs , and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture , willett and ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention ; and searched many times without success for the door in the which old manuscripts mentioned .
as to popular opinions of the bungalow various inhabitants , it was soon plain that the brava portuguese was loathed , the bearded and spectacled allen feared , and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound degree .
during the last week or two ward had obviously changed much , abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth .
such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there ; and over these ward and willett held many long and serious conferences .
they strove to exercise deduction , induction , and constructive imagination to their utmost extent ; and to correlate every known fact of charles later life , including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father , with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old joseph curwen .
they would have given much for a glimpse of the papers charles had found , for very clearly the key to the youth madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings .
and yet , after all , it was from no step of ward or willett that the next move in this singular case proceeded .
the father and the physician , rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat , had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer .
then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments , and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other .
officials who knew charles ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery , and were reassured less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible .
he could , he said , form no written characters at all except with great difficulty ; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters , even those to his father and mother , who would bear out the assertion .
what made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone , for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious , nor even the pawtuxet gossip , of which one or two of them had caught echoes .
it was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them , implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before .
something was wrong ; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech , there could be no normal reason for this blankness on vital points .
moreover , although none of these men knew ward well , they could not help observing the change in his language and manner .
they had heard he was an antiquarian , but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures .
altogether , this combination of hoarseness , palsied hands , bad memory , and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity , which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours ; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior ward was imperative .
so on the sixth of march , , there was a long and serious conference in ward office , after which the utterly bewildered father summoned willett in a kind of helpless resignation .
willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheque , and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note .
certainly , the change was radical and profound , and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing .
it had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort , and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used .
it was strange but where had he seen it before ?
on the whole , it was obvious that charles was insane .
of that there could be no doubt .
and since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer , something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure .
it was then that the alienists were called in , drs .
peck and waite of providence and lyman of boston , to whom ward and willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case , and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient , examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast .
after scanning this material and examining the ominous note to willett they all agreed that charles ward studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect , and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents ; but this latter they knew they could do , if at all , only after a scene at the bungalow itself .
willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy ; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen charles find the curwen documents , and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items , looking up the latter at the journal office .
on thursday , the eighth of march , drs .
willett , peck , lyman , and waite , accompanied by ward , paid the youth their momentous call ; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness .
charles , although he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance , proved a far from recalcitrant subject ; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies .
he offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon ; and seemed , indeed , to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory .
his conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal .
of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to willett , and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria .
he insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones , and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing .
neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiousity .
of the whereabouts of allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely , but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed .
in paying off the stolid brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors , and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets , ward shewed no signs of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint .
he was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation , as if he removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all .
it was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory , his lost voice and handwriting , and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him .
his mother , it was agreed , was not to be told of the change ; his father supplying typed notes in his name .
ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by waite on conanicut island in the bay , and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case .
it was then that the physical oddities were noticed ; the slackened metabolism , the altered skin , and the disproportionate neural reactions .
willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners , for he had attended ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation .
even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone , while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before , and which made willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the witch markings reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places .
the doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed record from salem which charles had shewn him in the old days , and which read .
on that nighte putt ye divell his marke upon bridget , jonathan , simon , deliverance , joseph , susan , mehitable , and deborah b . '
ward face , too , troubled him horribly , till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified .
for above the young man right eye was something which he had never previously noticed a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old joseph curwen , and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers .
while ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to allen , which ward had ordered delivered at the family home .
willett had predicted that very little would be found , since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger ; but in the latter part of march there did come a letter from prague for allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought .
it was in a very crabbed and archaic hand ; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner , shewed almost as singular a departure from modern english as the speech of young ward himself .
it read kleinstrasse , altstadt , prague , feby .

to in providence .
ward and willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity .
only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply .
so the absent allen , and not charles ward , had come to be the leading spirit at pawtuxet ?
that must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youth last frantic letter .
and what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as ?
there was no escaping the inference , but there are limits to possible monstrosity .
who was simon o .
; the old man ward had visited in prague four years previously ?
perhaps , but in the centuries behind there had been another simon simon orne , alias jedediah , of salem , who vanished in , and whose peculiar handwriting willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the orne formulae which charles had once shown him .
what horrors and mysteries , what contradictions and contraventions of nature , had come back after a century and a half to harass old providence with her clustered spires and domes ?
the father and the old physician , virtually at a loss what to do or think , went to see charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about allen , about the prague visit , and about what he had learned of simon or jedediah orne of salem .
to all these enquiries the youth was politely , merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past , and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in prague would probably be similarly gifted .
when they left , ward and willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism ; and that without imparting anything vital himself , the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the prague letter had contained .
drs .
peck , waite , and lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young ward companion ; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together , and believed that charles or allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart perhaps one who had seen orne handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone character reincarnation .
allen himself was perhaps a similar case , and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the curwen .
such things had been known before , and on the same basis the doctors disposed of willett growing disquiet about charles ward present handwriting , as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses .
willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last , and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old joseph curwen himself ; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort , and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable .
recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues , willett advised ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for allen on the second of april from rakus , transylvania , in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal .

nephreu ka nai hadoth edw .
for j curwen , esq .
providence .
but if willett and ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists , they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves .
no amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled allen , of whom charles frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace , was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of curwen old salem colleagues ; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of joseph curwen , and that he entertained or was at least advised to entertain murderous designs against a boy who could scarcely be other than charles ward .
there was organised horror afoot ; and no matter who had started it , the missing allen was by this time at the bottom of it .
therefore , thanking heaven that charles was now safe in the hospital , ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic , bearded doctor ; finding whence he had come and what pawtuxet knew of him , and if possible discovering his present whereabouts .
supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which charles yielded up , he urged them to explore allen vacant room which had been identified when the patient belongings had been packed ; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about .
ward talked with the detectives in his son old library , and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last ; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil .
perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel , and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant ; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation .
a nightmare and a cataclysm and now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of marinus bicknell willett , and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind .
willett had conferred at length with ward , and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule .
there was , they conceded , a terrible movement alive in the world , whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the salem witchcraft could not be doubted .
that at least two living men and one other of whom they dared not think were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws .
what these horrible creatures and charles ward as well were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case .
they were robbing the tombs of all the ages , including those of the world wisest and greatest men , in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them .
a hideous traffic was going on among these nightmare ghouls , whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books ; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentred in one man or group .
they had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive , either in the same body or different bodies ; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together .
there had , it seems , been some truth in chimerical old borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain essential saltes from which the shade of a living thing might be raised up .
there was a formula for evoking such a shade , and another for putting it down ; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully .
one must be careful about evocations , for the markers of old graves are not always accurate .
willett and ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion .
things presences or voices of some sort could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave , and in this process also one must be careful .
joseph curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things , and as for charles what might one think of him ?
what forces outside the spheres had reached him from joseph curwen day and turned his mind on forgotten things ?
he had been led to find certain directions , and he had used them .
he had talked with the man of horror in prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of transylvania .
and he must have found the grave of joseph curwen at last .
that newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook .
then he had summoned something , and it must have come .
that mighty voice aloft on good friday , and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory .
what were they like , with their depth and hollowness ?
was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger allen with his spectral bass ?
yes , that was what ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man if man it were over the telephone !
what hellish consciousness or voice , what morbid shade or presence , had come to answer charles ward secret rites behind that locked door ?
those voices heard in argument must have it red for three months good god !
was not that just before the vampirism broke out ?
the rifling of ezra weeden ancient grave , and the cries later at pawtuxet whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies ?
and then the bungalow and the bearded stranger , and the gossip , and the fear .
the final madness of charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain , but they did feel sure that the mind of joseph curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities .
was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility ?
allen had something to do with it , and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young man life .
in the meantime , since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute , some effort must be made to find it .
willett and ward , conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists , resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness ; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration .
the morning of april dawned clear , and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten .
ward had the key , and an entry and cursory survey were made .
from the disordered condition of allen room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before , and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value .
of course the main business lay in the cellar ; so thither they descended without much delay , again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner .
for a time everything seemed baffling , each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained .
willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath , the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young ward and his associates , where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means .
the doctor tried to put himself in charles place to see how a delver would be likely to start , but could not gain much inspiration from this method .
then he decided on elimination as a policy , and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal , trying to account for every inch separately .
he was soon substantially narrowed down , and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs , which he tried once before in vain .
now experimenting in every possible way , and exerting a double strength , he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot .
beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole , to which ward at once rushed with excited zeal .
the cover was not hard to lift , and the father had quite removed it when willett noticed the queerness of his aspect .
he was swaying and nodding dizzily , and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause .
in a moment willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water .
ward responded feebly , but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him .
wishing to take no chances , willett hastened out to broad street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his protests ; after which he produced an electric torch , covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze , and descended once more to peer into the depths .
the foul air had now slightly abated , and willett was able to send a beam of light down the stygian hold .
for about ten feet , he saw , it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder ; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building .
willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf .
he could not help thinking of what luke fenner had reported on that last monstrous night .
then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge , carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance .
slowly , as befitted one of his years , he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below .
this was ancient masonry , his torch told him ; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries .
down , down , ran the steps ; not spirally , but in three abrupt turns ; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty .
he had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly ; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more .
it was a godless sound ; one of those , insidious outrages of nature which are not meant to be .
to call it a dull wail , a whine , or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its quintessential loathsomeness and overtones .
was it for this that ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed ?
it was the most shocking thing that willett had ever heard , and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways .
the hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high in the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad .
its pavement was of large chipped flagstone , and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry .
its length he could not imagine , for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness .
of the archways , some had doors of the old colonial type , whilst others had none .
overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling , willett began to explore these archways one by one ; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings , each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses .
most of them had fireplaces , the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering .
never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half , in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders .
for many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet , and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of joseph curwen experimentation .
finally there came a room of obvious modernity , or at least of recent occupancy .
there were oil heaters , bookshelves and tables , chairs and cabinets , and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness .
candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places ; and finding a handy , willett lighted such as were ready for use .
in the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of charles ward .
of the books the doctor had seen many before , and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the prospect street mansion .
here and there was a piece well known to willett , and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomness and the wailing , both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps .
his first duty , as planned long ahead , was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance ; especially those portentous documents found by charles so long ago behind the picture in olney court .
as he search he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be ; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs , so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing .
once he found three large packets of letters with prague and rakus postmarks , and in writing clearly recognisable as orne and hutchinson ; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise .
at last , in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the ward home , willett found the batch of old curwen papers ; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse charles had granted him so many years ago .
the youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them , since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to orne and hutchinson , and the cipher with its key .
willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files .
since young ward immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake , the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter ; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted .
the oddity was the slight amount in charles normal writing , which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before .
on the other hand , there were literally reams of symbols and formulae , historical notes and philosophical comment , in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of joseph curwen , though of undeniably modern dating .
plainly , a part of the programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizard writing , which charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection .
of any third hand which might have been allen there was not a trace .
if he had indeed come to be the leader , he must have forced young ward to act as his amanuensis .
in this new material one mystic formula , or rather pair of formulae , recurred so often that willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest .
it consisted of two parallel columns , the one surmounted by the archaic symbol called dragon head and used in almanacs to indicate the ascending node , and the one headed by a corresponding sign of dragon tail or descending node .
the appearance of the whole was something like this , and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name , which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter .
the formulae were as follows exactly so , as willett is abundantly able to testify and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain , which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible good friday of the previous year .
, ' f ' ' h ' y so haunting were these formulae , and so frequently did he come upon them , that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath .
eventually , however , he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present ; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid .
he had still to find the hidden laboratory , so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaseless with that dull and hideous whine .
the next few rooms he tried were all abandoned , or filled only with crumbling boxes and leaden coffins ; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of joseph curwen original operations .
he thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared , of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world , and of what that final raiding party must have seen ; and then he decided it was better not to think any more .
once a great stone staircase mounted at his right , and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the curwen outbuildings perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high windows provided the steps he had descended had led from the farmhouse .
suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead , and the stench and the wailing grew stronger .
willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space , so great that his torchlight would not carry across it ; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof .
after a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of stonehenge , with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre ; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light .
but when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering , and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines .
instead , he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry .
these cells were empty , but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued , more insistent now than ever , and seemingly varied at time by a sort of slippery thumping .
from that frightful smell and that uncanny noise willett attention could no longer be diverted .
both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else , and carried a vague impression of being far below , even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery .
before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down , the doctor cast his beam of light about the floor .
it was very loosely paved , and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement , while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down .
to this ladder , singularly enough , appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything .
as he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest above the oddly pierced slabs , as if they might be crude leading down to some still deeper region of horror .
kneeling by one , he worked at it with his hands , and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it .
at his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key , and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone .
a stench unnameable now rose up from below , and the doctor head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness .
if he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination , willett was destined to be disappointed ; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent .
as the light shone down , the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps ; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind , futile scrambling and slippery thumping .
the explorer trembled , unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss , but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the brink ; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arm length to see what might lie below .
for a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy , brick walls sinking illimitably into that miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy ; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft , which must have been from twenty to feet below the stone floor where he lay .
the torch shook in his hand , but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well ; left starving by young ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away , and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded the floor of the great vaulted cavern .
whatever the things were , they could not lie down in their cramped spaces ; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded .
but marinus bicknell willett was sorry that he looked again ; for surgeon and veteran of the though he was , he has not been the same since .
it is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measurable dimensions could so shake and change a man ; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinker perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnameable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision .
in that second look willett saw such an outline or entity , for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark raving mad as any inmate of waite private hospital .
he dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous coördination , nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit .
he screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised ; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away from the damp pavement where dozens of tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries .
he tore his hands on the rough , loose stones , and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars , but still he kept on .
then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench , and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided .
he was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light ; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror , and crushed with a memory he never could efface .
beneath him dozens of those things still lived , and from one of those shafts the cover was removed .
he knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls , yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure might exist .
what the thing was , he would never tell .
it was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar , but it was alive .
nature had never made it in this form , for it was too palpably unfinished .
the deficiencies were of the most surprising sort , and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described .
willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which ward called up from imperfect salts , and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes .
if it had not had a certain significance , its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone .
it was not the worst thing depicted on that stone but willett never opened the other pits .
at the time , the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old curwen data he had digested long before ; a phrase used by simon or jedediah orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer , there was noth ' g but ye liveliest awfulness in that which rais upp from what he cou gather onlie a part of . '
then , horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image , there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned , twisted thing found in the fields a week after the curwen raid .
charles ward had once told the doctor what old slocum said of that object ; that it was neither thoroughly human , nor wholly allied to any animal which pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about .
these words hummed in the doctor mind as he rocked to and fro , squatting on the nitrous stone floor .
he tried to drive them out , and repeated the lord prayer to himself ; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic like the modernistic waste land of eliot , and finally reverting to the dual formula he had lately found in ward underground library ' , ' and so on till the final underlined zhro .
it seemed to soothe him , and he staggered to his feet after a time ; lamenting bitterly his torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air .
think he would not ; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library .
after a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away , and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling , always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered .
once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar , and from this spot he recoiled in loathing .
at another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed , and here his caution became almost pitiful .
but he did not come upon the dread aperture after all , nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him .
what had been down there made no sound nor stir .
evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it .
each time willett fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled .
his passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below , but generally it would produce no effect at all , since he moved very noiselessly .
several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly , and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one .
the thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run , which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit ; for he knew that once the light failed , his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period .
presently , however , he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right .
in a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young ward secret library , trembling with relief , and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety .
in another moment he was hastily filling the lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed , and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration .
for racked though he was with horror , his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost ; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind charles ward bizarre madness .
failing to find a lantern , he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry ; also filling his pockets with candles and matches , and taking with him a gallon can of oil , which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells .
to traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude , but he knew it must be done .
fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast wall which bounded the cavern area , and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search .
so willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling ; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar , or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it .
most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers , some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms ; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects .
one was packed with rotting and bales of spare clothing , and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before .
in another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing , as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men .
but what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared ; these , and the sinister incrustations upon them .
he liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomness of the crypt .
when he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come , and out of which many doors opened .
this he proceeded to investigate ; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents , he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose tanks and tables , furnaces and modern instruments , occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the laboratory of charles ward and no doubt of old joseph curwen before him .
after lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready , willett examined the place and all the appurtenances with the keenest interest ; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young ward dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry .
on the whole , little could be learned from the scientific ensemble , which included a ; so that the room was really rather a disappointment .
among the books was a tattered old copy of borellus in , and it was weirdly interesting to note that ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good merritt in curwen farmhouse more than a century and half before .
that old copy , of course , must have perished along with the rest of curwen occult library in the final raid .
three archways opened off the laboratory , and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn .
from his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms ; but these he canvassed with care , remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few he could decipher .
there was much clothing also stored in these rooms , and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate .
most interesting of all , perhaps , were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old joseph curwen laboratory appliances .
these had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders , but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the georgian period .
the third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps .
these lamps willett lighted , and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him .
some of the upper levels were wholly vacant , but most of the space was filled with small leaden jars of two general types ; one tall and without handles like a grecian lekythos or , and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a phaleron jug .
all had metal stoppers , and were covered with symbols moulded in low relief .
in a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity ; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading ' above them , and all the phalerons on the other , correspondingly labelled with a sign reading ' .
each of the jars of jugs , except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant , bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue ; and willett resolved to look for the latter presently .
for the moment , however , he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole , and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation .
the result was invariable .
both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance ; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull , neutral colour .
to the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal ; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the phalerons .
a powder might be by the side of a one , and any one in a phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos .
the most individual feature about the powders was their .
willett would pour one into his hand , and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on his palm .
the meaning of the two signs puzzled him , and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper .
custodes , materia ; that was the latin for guards and materials , respectively and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word guards before in connexion with this dreadful mystery .
it was , of course , in the recent letter to allen purporting to be from old edwin hutchinson ; and the phrase had read was no neede to keep the guards in shape and eat ' g off their heads , and it made much to be founde in case of trouble , as you too welle knowe . '
what did this signify ?
but wait was there not still another reference to guards in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the hutchinson letter ?
back in the old days ward had told him of the eleazar smith diary recording the spying of smith and weeden on the curwen farm , and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth .
there had been , smith and weeden insisted , terrible colloquies wherein figured curwen , certain captives of his , and the guards of those captives .
those guards , according to hutchinson or his avatar , had eaten their heads off , so that now allen did not keep them in shape .
and if not in shape , how save as the salts to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could ?
so that was what these lekythoi contained ; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds , presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help , when called up by some hellish incantation , in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing ?
willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands , and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels .
then he thought of the materia in the myriad phaleron jugs on the other side of the room .
salts too and if not the salts of guards , then the salts of what ?
god !
could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages ; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe , and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern , as poor charles had hinted in his frantic note , all civilisation , all natural law , perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe ?
and marinus bicknell willett had sifted their dust through his hands !
then he noticed a small door at the further end of the room , and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above .
it was only a symbol , but it filled him with vague spiritual dread ; for a morbid , dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep .
it was the sign of koth , that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight and willett did not like what his friend randolph carter had said of its powers .
but a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the air .
this was a chemical rather than animal smell , and came clearly from the room beyond the door .
and it was , unmistakably , the same odour which had saturated charles ward clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away .
so it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons ?
he was wiser that old joseph curwen , for he had not resisted .
willett , boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain , seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold .
a wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him , but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition .
there was nothing alive here to harm him , and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient .
the room beyond the door was of medium size , and had no furniture save a table , a single chair , and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels , which willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture .
on one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips , above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like grecian kylikes .
on the other side was the table ; with a powerful argand lamp , a pad and pencil , and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste .
willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad , to see what notes ward might have been jotting down when interrupted ; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed curwen chirography , which shed no light on the case as a whole ' b .

thrice and was ye nexte day deliver . '
' f .
soughte to wipe out all know ' g howe to raise those from outside . '
as the strong argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door , between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners , was covered with pegs from which hung a set of robes of a rather dismal .
but far more interesting were the two vacant walls , both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone .
the damp floor also bore marks of carving ; and with but little difficulty willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre , with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner .
in one of these four circles , near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down , there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the ; and just outside the periphery was one of the phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room , its tag numbered .
this was unstoppered , and proved upon inspection to be empty ; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not .
within its shallow area , and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern , lay a small amount of a dry , efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug ; and willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene .
the whips and the instruments of torture , the dust or salts from the jug of materia , the two lekythoi from the custodes shelf , the robes , the formulae on the walls , the notes on the pad , the hints from letters and legends , and the thousand glimpses , doubts , and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of charles ward all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor .
with an effort , however , willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls .
from the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in joseph curwen time , and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic .
one the doctor clearly recognised as what ward heard her son chanting on that ominous good friday a year before , and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres .
it was not spelled here exactly as ward had set it down from memory , nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of eliphas levi ; but its identity was unmistakable , and such words as sabaoth , metraton , almousin , and zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the search who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner .
this was on the wall as one entered the room .
the wall was no less thickly inscribed , and willett felt a start of recognition when he came up the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library .
they were , roughly speaking , the same ; with the ancient symbols of dragon head and dragon tail heading them as in ward scribblings .
but the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions , as if old curwen had had a different way of recording sound , or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question .
the doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head , and found it hard to do .
where the script he had memorised began , , this epigraph started out as aye , engengah , ; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word .
ground as the later text was into his consciousness , the discrepancy disturbed him ; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved .
weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice ; its accents keyed to a droning either through the spell of the past and the unknown , or through the hellish example of that dull , godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness .
, !
but what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant ?
the lamps were sputtering woefully , and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight .
there was smoke , too , and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the wells ; an odour like that he had smelt before , yet infinitely stronger and more pungent .
he turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents , and saw that the kylix on the floor , in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain , was giving forth a cloud of thick , vapour of surprising volume and opacity .
that powder great god !
it had come from the shelf of materia what was it doing now , and what had started it ?
the formula he had been chanting the first of the pair dragon head , ascending node blessed saviour , could it be
the doctor reeled , and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen , heard , and read of the frightful case of joseph curwen and charles dexter ward .
i say to you againe , doe not call up any that you can not put downe have ye wordes for laying at all times readie , and stopp not to be sure when there is any doubte of whom you have talkes with what was therein inhum mercy of heaven , what is that shape behind the parting smoke ?
marinus bicknell willett has not hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends , hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle .
only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated , and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old .
he has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance .
but ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth .
did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar ?
did not willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven that portentous morning ?
did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening , and again the next day , and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon , finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs ?
willett had been breathing stertorously , and opened his eyes slowly when ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car .
then he shuddered and screamed , crying out , beard those eyes god , who are you ? '
a very strange thing to say to a trim , , gentleman whom he had known from the latter boyhood .
in the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning .
willett clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees , and only a faint acrid odour reminded ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital .
the doctor flashlight was missing , but his valise was safely there , as empty as when he had brought it .
before indulging in any explanations , and obviously with great moral effort , willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs .
it was unyielding .
crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before , he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one .
underneath the smooth concrete was still visible , but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace .
nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs ; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks no noisome well , no world of subterrene horrors , no secret library , no curwen papers , no nightmare pits of stench and howling , no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae , no willett turned pale , and clutched at the younger man .
, ' he asked softly , you see it here and smell it ? '
and when ward , himself transfixed with dread and wonder , found strength to nod an affirmative , the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp , and nodded in turn .
i will tell you ' , he said .
so for an hour , in the sunniest room they could find upstairs , the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father .
there was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the vapour from the kylix parted , and willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred .
there were futile , bewildered from both men , and once ward ventured a hushed suggestion , you suppose it would be of any use to dig ? '
the doctor was silent , for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the great abyss .
again ward asked , where did it go ?
it brought you here , you know , and it sealed up the hole somehow . '
and willett again let silence answer for him .
but after all , this was not the final phase of the matter .
reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave , willett fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before , and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault .
it was a common sheet , torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground , and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad .
it was folded very carelessly , and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this .
but in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder ; for here was no script of any wholesome age , but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness , scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it , yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar .
the briefly scrawled message was this , and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair , who forthwith walked steadily out to the ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the john hay library on the hill .
at the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography , and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier .
in the end they found what was needed .
the letters were indeed no fantastic invention , but the normal script of a very dark period .
they were the pointed saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century , and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily , and the pale moon of britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the roman ruins of caerleon and hexham , and by the towers along hadrian crumbling wall .
the words were in such latin as a barbarous age might remember necandus est .
cadaver aq ( ua ) forti dissolvendum , nec aliq ( ui ) d retinendum .
tace ut potes . '
which may roughly be translated , curwen must be killed .
the body must be dissolved in aqua fortis , nor must anything be retained .
keep silence as best you are able .
willett and ward were mute and baffled .
they had met the unknown , and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought .
with willett , especially , the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was exhausted ; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave .
then they drove listlessly to the ward mansion in prospect street , and talked to no purpose into the night .
the doctor rested toward morning , but did not go home .
and he was still there sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up allen .
ward , who was pacing nervously about in a , answered the call in person ; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready .
both willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form , for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message , it seemed certain the curwen who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger .
charles had feared this man , and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid .
allen , moreover , had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in europe under the name of curwen , and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer .
and now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that curwen must be killed and dissolved in acid .
the linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious ; and besides , was not allen planning to murder young ward upon the advice of the creature called hutchinson ?
of course , the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger ; but from its text they could see that allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish .
without doubt , allen must be apprehended ; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out , he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon charles ward .
that afternoon , hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it , the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young charles at the hospital .
simply and gravely willett told him all he had found , and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery .
the physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could , and watched for a wincing on charles part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within .
but ward did not wince .
willett paused , and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving .
he taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity , and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply .
for charles , having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist , seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair ; and chucked hoarsely at something which amused him .
then he whispered , in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used , , they do eat , but they do need to !
that the rare part !
a month , you say , without food ?
lud , sir , you be modest !
d know , that was the joke on poor old whipple with his virtuous bluster !
kill everything off , would he ?
why , damme , he was with noise from outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells !
he never dreamed they were there at all !
devil take ye , those cursed things have been howling down there ever since curwen was done for a hundred and years gone ! '
but no more than this could willett get from the youth .
horrified , yet almost convinced against his will , he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained .
looking at the youth face , the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought .
truly , the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies .
when the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned , charles shewed his first sign of animation .
a quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what willett had read on the pad , and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones , of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic .
but , he added , you but known the words to bring up that which i had out in the cup , you had not been here to tell me this .
was number , and i conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in room .
was never raised by me , but i meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither . '
then willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the smoke which had arisen ; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on charles ward face .
came , and you be here alive ? '
as ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance .
willett , gifted with a flash of inspiration , believed he saw the situation , and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered .
.
, you say ?
but do forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten .
you are never sure till you question ! '
and then , without warning , he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patient eyes .
he could have wished no stronger result , for charles ward fainted forthwith .
all this conversation , of course , had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions .
unaided , too , willett and ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch .
in reviving , the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to orne and hutchinson at once ; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy , and had given allen advice for his assassination .
this revelation produced no visible effect , and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man .
after that he would converse no more , so willett and the father departed presently ; leaving behind a caution against the bearded allen , to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of , and could do no one any harm even if he wished .
this was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear .
they did not worry about any communications charles might indite to that monstrous pair in europe , since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or missive .
there is , however , a curious sequel to the matter of orne and hutchinson , if such indeed the exiled wizards were .
moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period , willett arranged with an international bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in prague and in eastern transylvania ; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated .
one was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of prague , and the disappearance of the evil old man called josef nadek , who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember .
the other was a titan explosion in the transylvanian mountains east of rakus , and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the castle ferenczy , whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory .
willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well ; and that while curwen was left to him to dispose of , the writer felt able to find and deal with orne and hutchinson itself .
of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think .
the following morning willett hastened to the ward home to be present when the detectives arrived .
allen destruction or imprisonment or curwen if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid he felt must be accomplished at any cost , and he communicated this conviction to ward as they sat waiting for the men to come .
they were downstairs this time , for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a particular nauseousness which hung indefinitely about ; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished curwen portrait .
at nine the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say .
they had not , regrettably enough , located the brava tony gomes as they had wished , nor had they found the least trace of allen source or present whereabouts ; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger .
allen had struck pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being , and there was a universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard , together with a pair of dark glasses , in his room at the fateful bungalow .
his voice , ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation , had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten ; and his glanced seemed malign even through his smoked and glasses .
one shopkeeper , in the course of negotiations , had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed ; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant .
in connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer , a majority of the gossips believed that allen rather than ward was the actual vampire .
statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery .
they had felt less of the sinister in allen , but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage .
the place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly , but they would know him again if they saw him .
his beard had looked odd , and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye .
as for the detectives ' search of allen room , it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses , and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror .
willett and ward caught something of a profound , subtle , and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded , and almost trembled in following up the vague , mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds .
the false beard and glasses the crabbed curwen penmanship the old portrait and its tiny scar and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar that deep , hollow voice on the telephone was it not of this that ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced ?
who had ever seen charles and allen together ?
yes , the officials had once , but who later on ?
was it not when allen left that charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow ?
curwen allen ward in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved ?
that damnable resemblance of the picture to charles had it not used to stare and stare , and follow the boy around the room with its eyes ?
why , too , did both allen and charles copy joseph curwen handwriting , even when alone and off guard ?
and then the frightful work of those people the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight ; the starving monsters in the noisome pits ; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results ; the message in minuscules found in willett pocket ; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and salts and discoveries whither did everything lead ?
in the end ward did the most sensible thing .
steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it , he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous allen .
that article was a photograph of his luckless son , on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from allen room .
for two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered .
then the men returned .
yes .
the altered photograph was a very passable likeness of allen .
ward turned pale , and willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief .
allen ward curwen it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought .
what had the boy called out of the void , and what had it done to him ?
what , really , had happened from first to last ?
who was this allen who sought to kill charles as too squeamish , and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid ?
why , too , had the minuscule message , of whose origin no one dared think , said that curwen must be likewise obliterated ?
what was the change , and when had the final stage occurred ?
that day when his frantic note was received he had been nervous all the morning , then there was an alteration .
he had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him .
that was the time , when he was out .
but no had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study this very room ?
what had he found there ?
or wait what had found him ?
that simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all ?
had not the butler spoken of queer noises ?
willett rang for the man and asked him some questions .
it had , surely enough , been a bad business .
there had been noises a cry , a gasp , a choking , and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping , or all of these .
and charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word .
the butler shivered as he spoke , and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs .
terror had settled definitely upon the house , and only the detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it .
even they were restless , for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all .
willett was thinking deeply and rapidly , and his thoughts were terrible ones .
now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new , appalling , and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings .
then ward made a sign that the conference was over , and everyone save him and the doctor left the room .
it was noon now , but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the mansion .
willett began talking very seriously to his host , and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him .
there would be , he predicted , certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative .
as family physician he must have a free hand , and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs , where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when joseph curwen features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel .
ward , dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side , could only acquiesce ; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from olney court .
the father , listening outside , heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed ; and finally a wrench and a creak , as if a tight cupboard door were being opened .
then there was a muffled cry , a kind of snorting choke , and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened .
almost at once the key rattled and willett appeared in the hall , haggard and ghastly , and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room .
the furnace was not enough , he said ; and the electric log had little practical use .
longing yet not daring to ask questions , ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs , shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate .
willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the july before .
they were in a covered basket , and ward never saw what they were .
then the doctor locked himself in the library once more , and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire .
later , after a great rustling of newspapers , that odd wrench and creaking were heard again ; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked .
thereafter two suppressed cries of willett were heard , and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness .
finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid , and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes .
ward head reeled , and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down .
after an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighted , and sounds of scraping , sweeping , and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door .
and at last , after the slamming of some cupboard within , willett made his appearance sad , pale , and haggard , and bearing the basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory .
he had left the window open , and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure , wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants .
the ancient overmantel still lingered ; but it seemed robbed of malignity now , and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of joseph curwen .
night was coming on , yet this time its shadows held no latent fright , but only a gentle melancholy .
of what he had done the doctor would never speak .
to ward he said , ' i can answer no questions , but i will say that there are different kinds of magic .
i have made a great purgation , and those in this house will sleep the better for it . '
that willett purgation had been an ordeal almost as in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening .
for three days he rested constantly in his room , though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on wednesday , when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness .
servants ' imaginations , fortunately , are limited , else comment might have been excited by an item in thursday evening bulletin which ran as follows north end ghouls again active after a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the weeden lot at the north burial ground , a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by robert hart , the night watchman .
happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about , hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest , and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light .
at once starting in pursuit , he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance , gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible .
like the first of the ghouls active during the past year , this intruder had done no real damage before detection .
a vacant part of the ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging , but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted , and no previous grave had been disturbed .
hart , who can not describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard , inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source ; but police from the second station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident , where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered .
the first of the incidents , in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated , occurred a year ago last march , and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache .
it is possible , says sergt .
riley , that this third affair is of similar nature .
officers at the second station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages .
all day thursday willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come .
in the evening he wrote a note to ward , which was delivered the next morning and which caused the parent to ponder long and deeply .
ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of monday with its baffling reports and its sinister purgation , but he found something calming about the doctor letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke .
barnes , providence , april , .
dear theodore - i feel that i must say a word to you before doing what i am going to do tomorrow .
it will conclude the terrible business we have been going through ( for i feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of ) , but i afraid it wo set your mind at rest unless i expressly assure you how very conclusive it is .
you have known me ever since you were a small boy , so i think you will not distrust me when i hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored .
it is better that you attempt no further speculation as to charles case , and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects .
when i call on you tomorrow charles will have escaped .
that is all which need remain in anyone mind .
he was mad , and he escaped .
you can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name .
i advise you to join her in atlantic city and take a rest yourself .
god knows you need one after this shock , as i do myself .
i am going south for a while to calm down and brace up .
so do ask me any questions when i call .
it may be that something will go wrong , but i tell you if it does .
i do think it will .
there will be nothing more to worry about , for charles will be very , very safe .
he is now safer than you dream .
you need hold no fears about allen , and who or what he is .
he forms as much a part of the past as joseph curwen picture , and when i ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person .
and what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours .
but you must steel yourself to melancholy , and prepare your wife to do the same .
i must tell you frankly that charles escape will not mean his restoration to you .
he has been afflicted with a peculiar disease , as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him , and you must not hope to see him again .
have only this consolation that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman , but only an eager , studious , and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing .
he stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know , and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach ; and something came out of those years to engulf him .
and now comes the matter in which i must ask you to trust me most of all .
for there will be , indeed , no uncertainty about charles fate .
in about a year , say , you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end ; for the boy will be no more .
you can put up a stone in your lot at the north burial ground exactly ten feet west of your father and facing the same way , and that will mark the true of your son .
nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling .
the ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew of the real charles dexter ward whose mind you watched from infancy the real charles with the on his hip and without the black on his chest or the pit on his forehead .
the charles who never did actual evil , and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness .
that is all .
charles will have escaped , and a year from now you can put up his stone .
do not question me tomorrow .
and believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now , as it has been at all times in the past .
with profoundest sympathy , and exhortations to fortitude , calmness , and resignation , i am ever sincerely your friend , marinus willett .
so on the morning of friday , april , , marinus bicknell willett visited the room of charles dexter ward at waite private hospital on conanicut island .
the youth , though making no attempt to evade his caller , was in a sullen mood ; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which willett obviously desired .
the doctor discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment , so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities .
then a new element of constraint crept in , as ward seemed to read behind the doctor face a terrible purpose which had never been there before .
the patient quailed , conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger .
ward actually turned pale , and the doctor was the first to speak .
, ' he said , been found out , and i must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due . '
again , and coming upon more poor starving pets ? '
was the ironic reply .
it was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last .
, ' willett slowly rejoined , time i did not have to dig .
we have had men looking up allen , and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow . '
, ' commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting , i trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on ! '
would become you very well , ' came the even and studied response , indeed they seem to have done . '
as willett said this , it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun ; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor .
then ward ventured is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning ?
suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold ? '
' , said willett gravely , you are wrong .
it is no business of mine if any man seeks duality ; provided he has any right to exist at all , and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space . '
ward now started violently .
, sir , what have ye found , and what d want of me ? '
the doctor let a little time elapse before replying , as if choosing his words for an effective answer .
' i have found ' , he finally intoned , in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was , and i have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of charles dexter ward ought to be . '
the madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting ye , who did ye tell and who believe it was he after these two full months , with me alive ?
what d mean to do ? '
willett , though a small man , actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture .
' i have told no one .
this is no common case it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with .
thank god some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination , that i might not go astray in thinking out this thing .
you can not deceive me , joseph curwen , for i know that your accursed magic is true !
' i know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant ; i know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave ; i know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night , and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him ; i know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the world tombs , and at what you planned afterward , and i know how you did it .
left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house .
they thought it was he who went in , and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him .
but you had reckoned on the different contents of two minds .
you were a fool , joseph curwen , to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough .
why did you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting ?
it has worked , you see , after all .
you know better than i who or what wrote that message in minuscules , but i will warn you it was not written in vain .
there are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out , and i believe that the writer of those words will attend to orne and hutchinson .
one of those creatures wrote you once , do not call up any that you can not put down .
you were undone once before , perhaps in that very way , and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again .
curwen , a man ca tamper with nature beyond certain limits , and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out . '
but here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him .
hopelessly at bay , weaponless , and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctor rescue , joseph curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally , and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep , hollow voice , now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness , bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula .
, , , ' but willett was too quick for him .
even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl , and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay , the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite .
an eye for an eye magic for magic let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned !
so in a clear voice marinus bicknell willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules the cryptic invocation whose heading was the dragon tail , sign of the descending node ' f ' ' h ' y !
at the very first word from willett mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short .
unable to speak , the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested .
when the awful name of was uttered , the hideous change began .
it was not merely a dissolution , but rather a transformation or recapitulation ; and willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced .
but he did not faint , and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again .
the madness out of time had subsided , and the case of charles dexter ward was closed .
opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror , willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss .
there had , as he had predicted , been no need for acids .
for like his accursed picture a year before , joseph curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine dust .
when age fell upon the world , and wonder went out of the minds of men ; when grey cities reared to smoky skies tall towers grim and ugly , in whose shadow none might dream of the sun or of spring flowering meads ; when learning stripped the earth of her mantle of beauty and poets sang no more of twisted phantoms seen with bleared and inward looking eyes ; when these things had come to pass , and childish hopes had gone forever , there was a man who traveled out of life on a quest into spaces whither the world dreams had fled .
of the name and abode of this man little is written , for they were of the waking world only ; yet it is said that both were obscure .
it is enough to say that he dwelt in a city of high walls where sterile twilight reigned , that he toiled all day among shadow and turmoil , coming home at evening to a room whose one window opened not to open fields and groves but on to a dim court where other windows stared in dull despair .
from that casement one might see only walls and windows , except sometimes when one leaned so far out and peered at the small stars that passed .
and because mere walls and windows must soon drive a man to madness who dreams and reads much , the dweller in that room used night after night to lean out and peer aloft to glimpse some fragment of things beyond the waking world and the tall cities .
after years he began to call the slow sailing stars by name , and to follow them in fancy when they glided regretfully out of sight ; till at length his vision opened to many secret vistas whose existance no common eye suspected .
and one night a mighty gulf was bridged , and the dream haunted skies swelled down to the lonely watcher window to merge with the close air of his room and to make him a part of their fabulous wonder .
there came to that room wild streams of violet midnight glittering with dust of gold , vortices of dust and fire , swirling out of the ultimate spaces and heavy perfumes from beyond the worlds .
opiate oceans poured there , litten by suns that the eye may never behold and having in their whirlpools strange dolphins and of unrememberable depths .
noiseless infinity eddied around the dreamer and wafted him away without touching the body that leaned stiffly from the lonely window ; and for days not counted in men calendars the tides of far spheres that bore him gently to join the course of other cycles that tenderly left him sleeping on a green sunrise shore , a green shore fragrant with lotus blossoms and starred by red camalotes
i have often wondered if the majority of mankind ever pause to reflect upon the occasionally titanic significance of dreams , and of the obscure world to which they belong .
whilst the greater number of our nocturnal visions are perhaps no more than faint and fantastic reflections of our waking experiences freud to the contrary with his puerile symbolism there are still a certain remainder whose immundane and ethereal character permit of no ordinary interpretation , and whose vaguely exciting and disquieting effect suggests possible minute glimpses into a sphere of mental existence no less important than physical life , yet separated from that life by an all but impassable barrier .
from my experience i can not doubt but that man , when lost to terrestrial consciousness , is indeed sojourning in another and uncorporeal life of far different nature from the life we know , and of which only the slightest and most indistinct memories linger after waking .
from those blurred and fragmentary memories we may infer much , yet prove little .
we may guess that in dreams life , matter , and vitality , as the earth knows such things , are not necessarily constant ; and that time and space do not exist as our waking selves comprehend them .
sometimes i believe that this less material life is our truer life , and that our vain presence on the terraqueous globe is itself the secondary or merely virtual phenomenon .
it was from a youthful revery filled with speculations of this sort that i arose one afternoon in the winter of , when to the state psychopathic institution in which i served as an interne was brought the man whose case has ever since haunted me so unceasingly .
his name , as given on the records , was joe slater , or slaader , and his appearance was that of the typical denizen of the catskill mountain region ; one of those strange , repellent scions of a primitive colonial peasant stock whose isolation for nearly three centuries in the hilly fastnesses of a countryside has caused them to sink to a kind of barbaric degeneracy , rather than advance with their more fortunately placed brethren of the thickly settled districts .
among these odd folk , who correspond exactly to the decadent element of white trash in the south , law and morals are ; and their general mental status is probably below that of any other section of native american people .
joe slater , who came to the institution in the vigilant custody of four state policemen , and who was described as a highly dangerous character , certainly presented no evidence of his perilous disposition when i first beheld him .
though well above the middle stature , and of somewhat brawny frame , he was given an absurd appearance of harmless stupidity by the pale , sleepy blueness of his small watery eyes , the scantiness of his neglected and growth of yellow beard , and the listless drooping of his heavy nether lip .
his age was unknown , since among his kind neither family records nor permanent family ties exist ; but from the baldness of his head in front , and from the decayed condition of his teeth , the head surgeon wrote him down as a man of about forty .
from the medical and court documents we learned all that could be gathered of his case this man , a vagabond , hunter and trapper , had always been strange in the eyes of his primitive associates .
he had habitually slept at night beyond the ordinary time , and upon waking would often talk of unknown things in a manner so bizarre as to inspire fear even in the hearts of an unimaginative populace .
not that his form of language was at all unusual , for he never spoke save in the debased patois of his environment ; but the tone and tenor of his utterances were of such mysterious wildness , that none might listen without apprehension .
he himself was generally as terrified and baffled as his auditors , and within an hour after awakening would forget all that he had said , or at least all that had caused him to say what he did ; relapsing into a bovine , normality like that of the other .
as slater grew older , it appeared , his matutinal aberrations had gradually increased in frequency and violence ; till about a month before his arrival at the institution had occurred the shocking tragedy which caused his arrest by the authorities .
one day near noon , after a profound sleep begun in a whiskey debauch at about five of the previous afternoon , the man had roused himself most suddenly , with ululations so horrible and unearthly that they brought several neighbors to his cabin a filthy sty where he dwelt with a family as indescribable as himself .
rushing out into the snow , he had flung his arms aloft and commenced a series of leaps directly upward in the air ; the while shouting his determination to reach some big , big cabin with brightness in the roof and walls and floor and the loud queer music far away .
as two men of moderate size sought to restrain him , he had struggled with maniacal force and fury , screaming of his desire and need to find and kill a certain thing that shines and shakes and laughs .
at length , after temporarily felling one of his detainers with a sudden blow , he had flung himself upon the other in a demoniac ecstasy of , shrieking fiendishly that he would jump high in the air and burn his way through anything that stopped him .
family and neighbors had now fled in a panic , and when the more courageous of them returned , slater was gone , leaving behind an unrecognizable thing that had been a living man but an hour before .
none of the mountaineers had dared to pursue him , and it is likely that they would have welcomed his death from the cold ; but when several mornings later they heard his screams from a distant ravine they realized that he had somehow managed to survive , and that his removal in one way or another would be necessary .
then had followed an armed , whose purpose ( whatever it may have been originally ) became that of a sheriff posse after one of the seldom popular state troopers had by accident observed , then questioned , and finally joined the seekers .
on the third day slater was found unconscious in the hollow of a tree , and taken to the nearest jail , where alienists from albany examined him as soon as his senses returned .
to them he told a simple story .
he had , he said , gone to sleep one afternoon about sundown after drinking much liquor .
he had awakened to find himself standing in the snow before his cabin , the mangled corpse of his neighbor peter slader at his feet .
horrified , he had taken to the woods in a vague effort to escape from the scene of what must have been his crime .
beyond these things he seemed to know nothing , nor could the expert questioning of his interrogators bring out a single additional fact .
that night slater slept quietly , and the next morning he awakened with no singular feature save a certain alteration of expression .
doctor barnard , who had been watching the patient , thought he noticed in the pale blue eyes a certain gleam of peculiar quality , and in the flaccid lips an all but imperceptible tightening , as if of intelligent determination .
but when questioned , slater relapsed into the habitual vacancy of the mountaineer , and only reiterated what he had said on the preceding day .
on the third morning occurred the first of the man mental attacks .
after some show of uneasiness in sleep , he burst forth into a frenzy so powerful that the combined efforts of four men were needed to bind him in a straightjacket .
the alienists listened with keen attention to his words , since their curiosity had been aroused to a high pitch by the suggestive yet mostly conflicting and incoherent stories of his family and neighbors .
slater raved for upward of fifteen minutes , babbling in his backwoods dialect of green edifices of light , oceans of space , strange music , and shadowy mountains and valleys .
but most of all did he dwell upon some mysterious blazing entity that shook and laughed and mocked at him .
this vast , vague personality seemed to have done him a terrible wrong , and to kill it in triumphant revenge was his paramount desire .
in order to reach it , he said , he would soar through abysses of emptiness , burning every obstacle that stood in his way .
thus ran his discourse , until with the greatest suddenness he ceased .
the fire of madness died from his eyes , and in dull wonder he looked at his questioners and asked why he was bound .
barnard unbuckled the leather harness and did not restore it till night , when he succeeded in persuading slater to don it of his own volition , for his own good .
the man had now admitted that he sometimes talked queerly , though he knew not why .
within a week two more attacks appeared , but from them the doctors learned little .
on the source of slater visions they speculated at length , for since he could neither read nor write , and had apparently never heard a legend or , his gorgeous imagery was quite inexplicable .
that it could not come from any known myth or romance was made especially clear by the fact that the unfortunate lunatic expressed himself only in his own simple manner .
he raved of things he did not understand and could not interpret ; things which he claimed to have experienced , but which he could not have learned through any normal or connected narration .
the alienists soon agreed that abnormal dreams were the foundation of the trouble ; dreams whose vividness could for a time completely dominate the waking mind of this basically inferior man .
with due formality slater was tried for murder , acquitted on the ground of insanity , and committed to the institution wherein i held so humble a post .
i have said that i am a constant speculator concerning , and from this you may judge of the eagerness with which i applied myself to the study of the new patient as soon as i had fully ascertained the facts of his case .
he seemed to sense a certain friendliness in me , born no doubt of the interest i could not conceal , and the gentle manner in which i questioned him .
not that he ever recognized me during his attacks , when i hung breathlessly upon his chaotic but cosmic ; but he knew me in his quiet hours , when he would sit by his barred window weaving baskets of straw and willow , and perhaps pining for the mountain freedom he could never again enjoy .
his family never called to see him ; probably it had found another temporary head , after the manner of decadent mountain folk .
by degrees i commenced to feel an overwhelming wonder at the mad and fantastic conceptions of joe slater .
the man himself was pitiably inferior in mentality and language alike ; but his glowing , titanic visions , though described in a barbarous disjointed jargon , were assuredly things which only a superior or even exceptional brain could conceive .
how , i often asked myself , could the stolid imagination of a catskill degenerate conjure up sights whose very possession argued a lurking spark of genius ?
how could any backwoods dullard have gained so much as an idea of those glittering realms of supernal radiance and space about which slater ranted in his furious delirium ?
more and more i inclined to the belief that in the pitiful personality who cringed before me lay the disordered nucleus of something beyond my comprehension ; something infinitely beyond the comprehension of my more experienced but less imaginative medical and scientific colleagues .
and yet i could extract nothing definite from the man .
the sum of all my investigation was , that in a kind of slater wandered or floated through resplendent and prodigious valleys , meadows , gardens , cities , and palaces of light , in a region unbounded and unknown to man ; that there he was no peasant or degenerate , but a creature of importance and vivid life , moving proudly and dominantly , and checked only by a certain deadly enemy , who seemed to be a being of visible yet ethereal structure , and who did not appear to be of human shape , since slater never referred to it as a man , or as aught save a thing .
this thing had done slater some hideous but unnamed wrong , which the maniac ( if maniac he were ) yearned to avenge .
from the manner in which slater alluded to their dealings , i judged that he and the luminous thing had met on equal terms ; that in his dream existence the man was himself a luminous thing of the same race as his enemy .
this impression was sustained by his frequent references to flying through space and burning all that impeded his progress .
yet these conceptions were formulated in rustic words wholly inadequate to convey them , a circumstance which drove me to the conclusion that if a dream world indeed existed , oral language was not its medium for the transmission of thought .
could it be that the dream soul inhabiting this inferior body was desperately struggling to speak things which the simple and halting tongue of dullness could not utter ?
could it be that i was face to face with intellectual emanations which would explain the mystery if i could but learn to discover and read them ?
i did not tell the older physicians of these things , for middle age is skeptical , cynical , and disinclined to accept new ideas .
besides , the head of the institution had but lately warned me in his paternal way that i was overworking ; that my mind needed a rest .
it had long been my belief that human thought consists basically of atomic or molecular motion , convertible into ether waves or radiant energy like heat , light and electricity .
this belief had early led me to contemplate the possibility of telepathy or mental communication by means of suitable apparatus , and i had in my college days prepared a set of transmitting and receiving instruments somewhat similar to the cumbrous devices employed in wireless telegraphy at that crude , pre radio period .
these i had tested with a , but achieving no result , had soon packed them away with other scientific odds and ends for possible future use .
now , in my intense desire to probe into the of joe slater , i sought these instruments again , and spent several days in repairing them for action .
when they were complete once more i missed no opportunity for their trial .
at each outburst of slater violence , i would fit the transmitter to his forehead and the receiver to my own , constantly making delicate adjustments for various hypothetical wave lengths of intellectual energy .
i had but little notion of how the would , if successfully conveyed , arouse an intelligent response in my brain , but i felt certain that i could detect and interpret them .
accordingly i continued my experiments , though informing no one of their nature .
it was on the of february , , that the thing occurred .
as i look back across the years i realize how unreal it seems , and sometimes wonder if old doctor fenton was not right when he charged it all to my excited imagination .
i recall that he listened with great kindness and patience when i told him , but afterward gave me a nerve powder and arranged for the vacation on which i departed the next week .
that fateful night i was wildly agitated and perturbed , for despite the excellent care he had received , joe slater was unmistakably dying .
perhaps it was his mountain freedom that he missed , or perhaps the turmoil in his brain had grown too acute for his rather sluggish physique ; but at all events the flame of vitality flickered low in the decadent body .
he was drowsy near the end , and as darkness fell he dropped off into a troubled sleep .
i did not strap on the straightjacket as was customary when he slept , since i saw that he was too feeble to be dangerous , even if he woke in mental disorder once more before passing away .
but i did place upon his head and mine the two ends of my cosmic radio , hoping against hope for a first and last message from the dream world in the brief time remaining .
in the cell with us was one nurse , a mediocre fellow who did not understand the purpose of the apparatus , or think to inquire into my course .
as the hours wore on i saw his head droop awkwardly in sleep , but i did not disturb him .
i myself , lulled by the rhythmical breathing of the healthy and the dying man , must have nodded a little later .
the sound of weird lyric melody was what aroused me .
chords , vibrations , and harmonic ecstasies echoed passionately on every hand , while on my ravished sight burst the stupendous spectacle of ultimate beauty .
walls , columns , and architraves of living fire blazed effulgently around the spot where i seemed to float in air , extending upward to an infinitely high vaulted dome of indescribable splendor .
blending with this display of palatial magnificence , or rather , supplanting it at times in kaleidoscopic rotation , were glimpses of wide plains and graceful valleys , high mountains and inviting grottoes , covered with every lovely attribute of scenery which my delighted eyes could conceive of , yet formed wholly of some glowing , ethereal plastic entity , which in consistency partook as much of spirit as of matter .
as i gazed , i perceived that my own brain held the key to these enchanting metamorphoses ; for each vista which appeared to me was the one my changing mind most wished to behold .
amidst this elysian realm i dwelt not as a stranger , for each sight and sound was familiar to me ; just as it had been for uncounted eons of eternity before , and would be for like eternities to come .
then the resplendent aura of my brother of light drew near and held colloquy with me , soul to soul , with silent and perfect interchange of thought .
the hour was one of approaching triumph , for was not my escaping at last from a degrading periodic bondage ; escaping forever , and preparing to follow the accursed oppressor even unto the uttermost fields of ether , that upon it might be wrought a flaming cosmic vengeance which would shake the spheres ?
we floated thus for a little time , when i perceived a slight blurring and fading of the objects around us , as though some force were recalling me to earth where i least wished to go .
the form near me seemed to feel a change also , for it gradually brought its discourse toward a conclusion , and itself prepared to quit the scene , fading from my sight at a rate somewhat less rapid than that of the other objects .
a few more thoughts were exchanged , and i knew that the luminous one and i were being recalled to bondage , though for my brother of light it would be the last time .
the sorry planet shell being spent , in less than an hour my fellow would be free to pursue the oppressor along the milky way and past the hither stars to the very confines of infinity .
a shock separates my final impression of the fading scene of light from my sudden and somewhat shamefaced awakening and straightening up in my chair as i saw the dying figure on the couch move hesitantly .
joe slater was indeed awaking , though probably for the last time .
as i looked more closely , i saw that in the sallow cheeks shone spots of color which had never before been present .
the lips , too , seemed unusual , being tightly compressed , as if by the force of a stronger character than had been slater .
the whole face finally began to grow tense , and the head turned restlessly with closed eyes .
i did not rouse the sleeping nurse , but readjusted the slightly disarranged headband of my telepathic radio , intent to catch any parting message the dreamer might have to deliver .
all at once the head turned sharply in my direction and the eyes fell open , causing me to stare in blank amazement at what i beheld .
the man who had been joe slater , the catskill decadent , was gazing at me with a pair of luminous , expanding eyes whose blue seemed subtly to have deepened .
neither mania nor degeneracy was visible in that gaze , and i felt beyond a doubt that i was viewing a face behind which lay an active mind of high order .
at this juncture my brain became aware of a steady external influence operating upon it .
i closed my eyes to concentrate my thoughts more profoundly and was rewarded by the positive knowledge that my long sought mental message had come at last .
each transmitted idea formed rapidly in my mind , and though no actual language was employed , my habitual association of conception and expression was so great that i seemed to be receiving the message in ordinary english .
joe slater is dead , came the voice of an agency from beyond the wall of sleep .
my opened eyes sought the couch of pain in curious horror , but the blue eyes were still calmly gazing , and the countenance was still intelligently animated .
he is better dead , for he was unfit to bear the active intellect of cosmic entity .
his gross body could not undergo the needed adjustments between ethereal life and planet life .
he was too much an animal , too little a man ; yet it is through his deficiency that you have come to discover me , for the cosmic and planet souls rightly should never meet .
he has been my torment and diurnal prison for of your terrestrial years .
i am an entity like that which you yourself become in the freedom of dreamless sleep .
i am your brother of light , and have floated with you in the effulgent valleys .
it is not permitted me to tell your waking of your real self , but we are all roamers of vast spaces and travelers in many ages .
next year i may be dwelling in the egypt which you call ancient , or in the cruel empire of tsan chan which is to come three thousand years hence .
you and i have drifted to the worlds that reel about the red arcturus , and dwelt in the bodies of the that crawl proudly over the fourth moon of jupiter .
how little does the earth self know life and its extent !
how little , indeed , ought it to know for its own tranquility !
of the oppressor i can not speak .
you on earth have unwittingly felt its distant presence you who without knowing idly gave the blinking beacon the name of algol , the .
it is to meet and conquer the oppressor that i have vainly striven for eons , held back by bodily encumbrances .
tonight i go as a nemesis bearing just and blazingly cataclysmic vengeance .
watch me in the sky close by the .
i can not speak longer , for the body of joe slater grows cold and rigid , and the coarse brains are ceasing to vibrate as i wish .
you have been my only friend on this planet the only soul to sense and seek for me within the repellent form which lies on this couch .
we shall meet again perhaps in the shining mists of orion sword , perhaps on a bleak plateau in prehistoric asia , perhaps in unremembered dreams tonight , perhaps in some other form an eon hence , when the solar system shall have been swept away .
at this point the abruptly ceased , the pale eyes of the dreamer or can i say dead man ? commenced to glaze fishily .
in a i crossed over to the couch and felt of his wrist , but found it cold , stiff , and pulseless .
the sallow cheeks paled again , and the thick lips fell open , disclosing the repulsively rotten fangs of the degenerate joe slater .
i shivered , pulled a blanket over the hideous face , and awakened the nurse .
then i left the cell and went silently to my room .
i had an instant and unaccountable craving for a sleep whose dreams i should not remember .
the climax ?
what plain tale of science can boast of such a rhetorical effect ?
i have merely set down certain things appealing to me as facts , allowing you to construe them as you will .
as i have already admitted , my superior , old doctor fenton , denies the reality of everything i have related .
he vows that i was broken down with nervous strain , and badly in need of a long vacation on full pay which he so generously gave me .
he assures me on his professional honor that joe slater was but a paranoiac , whose fantastic notions must have come from the crude hereditary which circulated in even the most decadent of communities .
all this he tells me yet i can not forget what i saw in the sky on the night after slater died .
lest you think me a biased witness , another pen must add this final testimony , which may perhaps supply the climax you expect .
i will quote the following account of the star nova persei verbatim from the pages of that eminent astronomical authority , professor garrett serviss on february , , a marvelous new star was discovered by doctor anderson of edinburgh , not very far from algol .
no star had been visible at that point before .
within hours the stranger had become so bright that it outshone capella .
in a week or two it had visibly faded , and in the course of a few months it was hardly discernible with the naked eye .
in a dream kuranes saw the city in the valley , and the seacoast beyond , and the snowy peak overlooking the sea , and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky .
in a dream it was also that he came by his name of kuranes , for when awake he was called by another name .
perhaps it was natural for him to dream a new name ; for he was the last of his family , and alone among the indifferent millions of london , so there were not many to speak to him and to remind him who he had been .
his money and lands were gone , and he did not care for the ways of the people about him , but preferred to dream and write of his dreams .
what he wrote was laughed at by those to whom he showed it , so that after a time he kept his writings to himself , and finally ceased to write .
the more he withdrew from the world about him , the more wonderful became his dreams ; and it would have been quite futile to try to describe them on paper .
kuranes was not modern , and did not think like others who wrote .
whilst they strove to strip from life its embroidered robes of myth and to show in naked ugliness the foul thing that is reality , kuranes sought for beauty alone .
when truth and experience failed to reveal it , he sought it in fancy and illusion , and found it on his very doorstep , amid the nebulous memories of childhood tales and dreams .
there are not many persons who know what wonders are opened to them in the stories and visions of their youth ; for when as children we listen and dream , we think but thoughts , and when as men we try to remember , we are dulled and prosaic with the poison of life .
but some of us awake in the night with strange phantasms of enchanted hills and gardens , of fountains that sing in the sun , of golden cliffs overhanging murmuring seas , of plains that stretch down to sleeping cities of bronze and stone , and of shadowy companies of heroes that ride caparisoned white horses along the edges of thick forests ; and then we know that we have looked back through the ivory gates into that world of wonder which was ours before we were wise and unhappy .
kuranes came very suddenly upon his old world of childhood .
he had been dreaming of the house where he had been born ; the great stone house covered with ivy , where thirteen generations of his ancestors had lived , and where he had hoped to die .
it was moonlight , and he had stolen out into the fragrant summer night , through the gardens , down the terraces , past the great oaks of the park , and along the long white road to the village .
the village seemed very old , eaten away at the edge like the moon which had commenced to wane , and kuranes wondered whether the peaked roofs of the small houses hid sleep or death .
in the streets were spears of long grass , and the on either side broken or filmily staring .
kuranes had not lingered , but had plodded on as though summoned toward some goal .
he dared not disobey the summons for fear it might prove an illusion like the urges and aspirations of waking life , which do not lead to any goal .
then he had been drawn down a lane that led off from the village street toward the channel cliffs , and had come to the end of things to the precipice and the abyss where all the village and all the world fell abruptly into the unechoing emptiness of infinity , and where even the sky ahead was empty and unlit by the crumbling moon and the peering stars .
faith had urged him on , over the precipice and into the gulf , where he had floated down , down , down ; past dark , shapeless , undreamed dreams , faintly glowing spheres that may have been partly dreamed dreams , and laughing winged things that seemed to mock the dreamers of all the worlds .
then a rift seemed to open in the darkness before him , and he saw the city of the valley , glistening radiantly far , far below , with a background of sea and sky , and a snowcapped mountain near the shore .
kuranes had awakened the very moment he beheld the city , yet he knew from his brief glance that it was none other than celephais , in the valley of beyond the tanarian hills where his spirit had dwelt all the eternity of an hour one summer afternoon very long ago , when he had slipt away from his nurse and let the warm lull him to sleep as he watched the clouds from the cliff near the village .
he had protested then , when they had found him , waked him , and carried him home , for just as he was aroused he had been about to sail in a golden galley for those alluring regions where the sea meets the sky .
and now he was equally resentful of awaking , for he had found his fabulous city after forty weary years .
but three nights afterward kuranes came again to celephais .
as before , he dreamed first of the village that was asleep or dead , and of the abyss down which one must float silently ; then the rift appeared again , and he beheld the glittering minarets of the city , and saw the graceful galleys riding at anchor in the blue harbour , and watched the gingko trees of mount aran swaying in the .
but this time he was not snatched away , and like a winged being settled gradually over a grassy hillside til finally his feet rested gently on the turf .
he had indeed come back to the valley of and the splendid city of celephais .
down the hill amid scented grasses and brilliant flowers walked kuranes , over the bubbling naraxa on the small wooden bridge where he had carved his name so many years ago , and through the whispering grove to the great stone bridge by the city gate .
all was as of old , nor were the marble walls discoloured , nor the polished bronze statues upon them tarnished .
and kuranes saw that he need not tremble lest the things he knew be vanished ; for even the sentries on the ramparts were the same , and still as young as he remembered them .
when he entered the city , past the bronze gates and over the onyx pavements , the merchants and greeted him as if he had never been away ; and it was the same at the turquoise temple of , where the priests told him that there is no time in ooth nargai , but only perpetual youth .
then kuranes walked through the street of pillars to the seaward wall , where gathered the traders and sailors , and strange men from the regions where the sea meets the sky .
there he stayed long , gazing out over the bright harbour where the ripples sparkled beneath an unknown sun , and where rode lightly the galleys from far places over the water .
and he gazed also upon mount aran rising regally from the shore , its lower slopes green with swaying trees and its white summit touching the sky .
more than ever kuranes wished to sail in a galley to the far places of which he had heard so many strange tales , and he sought again the captain who had agreed to carry him so long ago .
he found the man , athib , sitting on the same chest of spice he had sat upon before , and athib seemed not to realize that any time had passed .
then the two rowed to a galley in the harbour , and giving orders to the oarmen , commenced to sail out into the billowy cerenarian sea that leads to the sky .
for several days they glided undulatingly over the water , till finally they came to the horizon , where the sea meets the sky .
here the galley paused not at all , but floated easily in the blue of the sky among fleecy clouds tinted with rose .
and far beneath the keel kuranes could see strange lands and rivers and cities of surpassing beauty , spread indolently in the sunshine which seemed never to lessen or disappear .
at length athib told him that their journey was near its end , and that they would soon enter the harbour of serannian , the pink marble city of the clouds , which is built on that ethereal coast where the west wind flows into the sky ; but as the highest of the city carven towers came into sight there was a sound somewhere in space , and kuranes awaked in his london garret .
for many months after that kuranes sought the marvellous city of celephais and its galleys in vain ; and though his dreams carried him to many gorgeous and places , no one whom he met could tell him how to find beyond the tanarian hills .
one night he went flying over dark mountains where there were faint , lone campfires at great distances apart , and strange , shaggy herds with tinkling bells on the leaders , and in the wildest part of this hilly country , so remote that few men could ever have seen it , he found a hideously ancient wall or causeway of stone zigzagging along the ridges and valleys ; too gigantic ever to have risen by human hands , and of such a length that neither end of it could be seen .
beyond that wall in the grey dawn he came to a land of quaint gardens and cherry trees , and when the sun rose he beheld such beauty of red and white flowers , green foliage and lawns , white paths , diamond brooks , blue lakelets , carven bridges , and pagodas , that he for a moment forgot celephais in sheer delight .
but he remembered it again when he walked down a white path toward a pagoda , and would have questioned the people of this land about it , had he not found that there were no people there , but only birds and bees and butterflies .
on another night kuranes walked up a damp stone spiral stairway endlessly , and came to a tower window overlooking a mighty plain and river lit by the full moon ; and in the silent city that spread away from the river bank he thought he beheld some feature or arrangement which he had known before .
he would have descended and asked the way to had not a fearsome aurora sputtered up from some remote place beyond the horizon , showing the ruin and antiquity of the city , and the stagnation of the reedy river , and the death lying upon that land , as it had lain since king kynaratholis came home from his conquests to find the vengeance of the gods .
so kuranes sought fruitlessly for the marvellous city of celephais and its galleys that sail to serannian in the sky , meanwhile seeing many wonders and once barely escaping from the not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery in the cold desert plateau of leng .
in time he grew so impatient of the bleak intervals of day that he began buying drugs in order to increase his periods of sleep .
hasheesh helped a great deal , and once sent him to a part of space where form does not exist , but where glowing gases study the secrets of existence .
and a gas told him that this part of space was outside what he had called infinity .
the gas had not heard of planets and organisms before , but identified kuranes merely as one from the infinity where matter , energy , and gravitation exist .
kuranes was now very anxious to return to celephais , and increased his doses of drugs ; but eventually he had no more money left , and could buy no drugs .
then one summer day he was turned out of his garret , and wandered aimlessly through the streets , drifting over a bridge to a place where the houses grew thinner and thinner .
and it was there that fulfillment came , and he met the cortege of knights come from celephais to bear him thither forever .
handsome knights they were , astride roan horses and clad in shining armour with tabards of curiously emblazoned .
so numerous were they , that kuranes almost mistook them for an army , but they were sent in his honour ; since it was he who had created in his dreams , on which account he was now to be appointed its chief god for evermore .
then they gave kuranes a horse and placed him at the head of the cavalcade , and all rode majestically through the downs of surrey and onward toward the region where kuranes and his ancestors were born .
it was very strange , but as the riders went on they seemed to gallop back through time ; for whenever they passed through a village in the twilight they saw only such houses and villagers as chaucer or men before him might have seen , and sometimes they saw knights on horseback with small companies of retainers .
when it grew dark they travelled more swiftly , till soon they were flying uncannily as if in the air .
in the dim dawn they came upon the village which kuranes had seen alive in his childhood , and asleep or dead in his dreams .
it was alive now , and early villagers curtsied as the horsemen clattered down the street and turned off into the lane that ends in the abyss of dreams .
kuranes had previously entered that abyss only at night , and wondered what it would look like by day ; so he watched anxiously as the column approached its brink .
just as they galloped up the rising ground to the precipice a golden glare came somewhere out of the west and hid all the landscape in effulgent draperies .
the abyss was a seething chaos of roseate and cerulean splendour , and invisible voices sang exultantly as the knightly entourage plunged over the edge and floated gracefully down past glittering clouds and silvery coruscations .
endlessly down the horsemen floated , their chargers pawing the aether as if galloping over golden sands ; and then the luminous vapours spread apart to reveal a greater brightness , the brightness of the city celephais , and the sea coast beyond , and the snowy peak overlooking the sea , and the gaily painted galleys that sail out of the harbour toward distant regions where the sea meets the sky .
and kuranes reigned thereafter over and all the neighboring regions of dream , and held his court alternately in celephais and in the serannian .
he reigns there still , and will reign happily for ever , though below the cliffs at innsmouth the channel tides played mockingly with the body of a tramp who had stumbled through the village at dawn ; played mockingly , and cast it upon the rocks by trevor towers , where a notably fat and especially offensive millionaire brewer enjoys the purchased atmosphere of extinct nobility .
you ask me to explain why i am afraid of a draught of cool air ; why i shiver more than others upon entering a cold room , and seem nauseated and repelled when the chill of evening creeps through the heat of a mild autumn day .
there are those who say i respond to cold as others do to a bad odour , and i am the last to deny the impression .
what i will do is to relate the most horrible circumstance i ever encountered , and leave it to you to judge whether or not this forms a suitable explanation of my peculiarity .
it is a mistake to fancy that horror is associated inextricably with darkness , silence , and solitude .
i found it in the glare of , in the clangour of a metropolis , and in the teeming midst of a shabby and commonplace with a prosaic landlady and two stalwart men by my side .
in the spring of i had secured some dreary and unprofitable magazine work in the city of new york ; and being unable to pay any substantial rent , began drifting from one cheap boarding establishment to another in search of a room which might combine the qualities of decent cleanliness , endurable furnishings , and very reasonable price .
it soon developed that i had only a choice between different evils , but after a time i came upon a house in west fourteenth street which disgusted me much less than the others i had sampled .
the place was a mansion of brownstone , dating apparently from the late forties , and fitted with woodwork and marble whose stained and sullied splendour argued a descent from high levels of tasteful opulence .
in the rooms , large and lofty , and decorated with impossible paper and ridiculously ornate stucco cornices , there lingered a depressing mustiness and hint of obscure cookery ; but the floors were clean , the linen tolerably regular , and the hot water not too often cold or turned off , so that i came to regard it as at least a bearable place to hibernate till one might really live again .
the landlady , a slatternly , almost bearded spanish woman named herrero , did not annoy me with gossip or with criticisms of the electric light in my front hall room ; and my were as quiet and uncommunicative as one might desire , being mostly spaniards a little above the coarsest and crudest grade .
only the din of street cars in the thoroughfare below proved a serious annoyance .
i had been there about three weeks when the first odd incident occurred .
one evening at about eight i heard a spattering on the floor and became suddenly aware that i had been smelling the pungent odour of ammonia for some time .
looking about , i saw that the ceiling was wet and dripping ; the soaking apparently proceeding from a corner on the side toward the street .
anxious to stop the matter at its source , i hastened to the basement to tell the landlady ; and was assured by her that the trouble would quickly be set right .
doctair muñoz , she cried as she rushed upstairs ahead of me , he have speel hees chemicals .
he ees too seeck for doctair heemself seecker and seecker all the time but he weel not have no othair for help .
he ees vairy queer in hees seeckness all day he take funnee smelling baths , and he can not get excite or warm .
all hees own housework he do hees leetle room are full of bottles and machines , and he do not work as doctair .
but he was great once my fathair in barcelona have hear of heem and only joost now he feex a arm of the plumber that get hurt of sudden .
he nevair go out , only on roof , and my boy esteban he breeng heem hees food and laundry and mediceens and chemicals .
my gawd , the that man use for keep heem cool !
herrero disappeared up the staircase to the fourth floor , and i returned to my room .
the ammonia ceased to drip , and as i cleaned up what had spilled and opened the window for air , i heard the landlady heavy footsteps above me .
muñoz i had never heard , save for certain sounds as of some mechanism ; since his step was soft and gentle .
i wondered for a moment what the strange affliction of this man might be , and whether his obstinate refusal of outside aid were not the result of a rather baseless eccentricity .
there is , i reflected tritely , an infinite deal of pathos in the state of an eminent person who has come down in the world .
i might never have known muñoz had it not been for the heart attack that suddenly seized me one forenoon as i sat writing in my room .
physicians had told me of the danger of those spells , and i knew there was no time to be lost ; so remembering what the landlady had said about the invalid help of the injured workman , i dragged myself upstairs and knocked feebly at the door above mine .
my knock was answered in good english by a curious voice some distance to the right , asking my name and business ; and these things being stated , there came an opening of the door next to the one i had sought .
a rush of cool air greeted me ; and though the day was one of the hottest of late june , i shivered as i crossed the threshold into a large apartment whose rich and tasteful decoration surprised me in this nest of squalor and seediness .
a folding couch now filled its diurnal role of sofa , and the mahogany furniture , sumptuous hangings , old paintings , and mellow bookshelves all bespoke a gentleman study rather than a bedroom .
i now saw that the hall room above mine the leetle room of bottles and machines which herrero had mentioned was merely the laboratory of the doctor ; and that his main living quarters lay in the spacious adjoining room whose convenient alcoves and large contiguous bathroom permitted him to hide all dressers and obtrusively utilitarian devices .
muñoz , most certainly , was a man of birth , cultivation , and discrimination .
the figure before me was short but exquisitely proportioned , and clad in somewhat formal dress of perfect cut and fit .
a face of masterful though not arrogant expression was adorned by a short iron grey full beard , and an shielded the full , dark eyes and surmounted an aquiline nose which gave a moorish touch to a physiognomy otherwise dominantly celtiberian .
thick , hair that argued the punctual calls of a barber was parted gracefully above a high forehead ; and the whole picture was one of striking intelligence and superior blood and breeding .
nevertheless , as i saw muñoz in that blast of cool air , i felt a repugnance which nothing in his aspect could justify .
only his lividly inclined complexion and coldness of touch could have afforded a physical basis for this feeling , and even these things should have been excusable considering the man known invalidism .
it might , too , have been the singular cold that alienated me ; for such chilliness was abnormal on so hot a day , and the abnormal always excites aversion , distrust , and fear .
but repugnance was soon forgotten in admiration , for the strange physician extreme skill at once became manifest despite the and shakiness of his hands .
he clearly understood my needs at a glance , and ministered to them with a master deftness ; the while reassuring me in a finely modulated though oddly hollow and timbreless voice that he was the bitterest of sworn enemies to death , and had sunk his fortune and lost all his friends in a lifetime of bizarre experiment devoted to its bafflement and extirpation .
something of the benevolent fanatic seemed to reside in him , and he rambled on almost garrulously as he sounded my chest and mixed a suitable draught of drugs fetched from the smaller laboratory room .
evidently he found the society of a man a rare novelty in this dingy environment , and was moved to unaccustomed speech as memories of better days surged over him .
his voice , if queer , was at least soothing ; and i could not even perceive that he breathed as the fluent sentences rolled urbanely out .
he sought to distract my mind from my own seizure by speaking of his theories and experiments ; and i remember his tactfully consoling me about my weak heart by insisting that will and consciousness are stronger than organic life itself , so that if a bodily frame be but originally healthy and carefully preserved , it may through a scientific enhancement of these qualities retain a kind of nervous animation despite the most serious impairments , defects , or even absences in the battery of specific organs .
he might , he half jestingly said , some day teach me to live or at least to possess some kind of conscious existence without any heart at all !
for his part , he was afflicted with a complication of maladies requiring a very exact regimen which included constant cold .
any marked rise in temperature might , if prolonged , affect him fatally ; and the frigidity of his habitation some or degrees fahrenheit was maintained by an absorption system of ammonia cooling , the gasoline engine of whose pumps i had often heard in my own room below .
relieved of my seizure in a marvellously short while , i left the shivery place a disciple and devotee of the gifted recluse .
after that i paid him frequent overcoated calls ; listening while he told of secret researches and almost ghastly results , and trembling a bit when i examined the unconventional and astonishingly ancient volumes on his shelves .
i was eventually , i may add , almost cured of my disease for all time by his skillful ministrations .
it seems that he did not scorn the incantations of the mediaevalists , since he believed these cryptic formulae to contain rare psychological stimuli which might conceivably have singular effects on the substance of a nervous system from which organic pulsations had fled .
i was touched by his account of the aged torres of valencia , who had shared his earlier experiments and nursed him through the great illness of eighteen years before , whence his present disorders proceeded .
no sooner had the venerable practitioner saved his colleague than he himself succumbed to the grim enemy he had fought .
perhaps the strain had been too great ; for muñoz made it whisperingly clear though not in detail that the methods of healing had been most extraordinary , involving scenes and processes not welcomed by elderly and conservative galens .
as the weeks passed , i observed with regret that my new friend was indeed slowly but unmistakably losing ground physically , as herrero had suggested .
the livid aspect of his countenance was intensified , his voice became more hollow and indistinct , his muscular motions were less perfectly coordinated , and his mind and will displayed less resilience and initiative .
of this sad change he seemed by no means unaware , and little by little his expression and conversation both took on a gruesome irony which restored in me something of the subtle repulsion i had originally felt .
he developed strange caprices , acquiring a fondness for exotic spices and egyptian incense till his room smelled like a vault of a sepulchred pharaoh in the valley of kings .
at the same time his demands for cold air increased , and with my aid he amplified the ammonia piping of his room and modified the pumps and feed of his refrigerating machine till he could keep the temperature as low as degrees or degrees , and finally even degrees ; the bathroom and laboratory , of course , being less chilled , in order that water might not freeze , and that chemical processes might not be impeded .
the tenant adjoining him complained of the icy air from around the connecting door , so i helped him fit heavy hangings to obviate the difficulty .
a kind of growing horror , of outre and morbid cast , seemed to possess him .
he talked of death incessantly , but laughed hollowly when such things as burial or funeral arrangements were gently suggested .
all in all , he became a disconcerting and even gruesome companion ; yet in my gratitude for his healing i could not well abandon him to the strangers around him , and was careful to dust his room and attend to his needs each day , muffled in a heavy ulster which i bought especially for the purpose .
i likewise did much of his shopping , and gasped in bafflement at some of the chemicals he ordered from druggists and laboratory supply houses .
an increasing and unexplained atmosphere of panic seemed to rise around his apartment .
the whole house , as i have said , had a musty odour ; but the smell in his room was worse and in spite of all the spices and incense , and the pungent chemicals of the now incessant baths which he insisted on taking unaided .
i perceived that it must be connected with his ailment , and shuddered when i reflected on what that ailment might be .
herrero crossed herself when she looked at him , and gave him up unreservedly to me ; not even letting her son esteban continue to run errands for him .
when i suggested other physicians , the sufferer would fly into as much of a rage as he seemed to dare to entertain .
he evidently feared the physical effect of violent emotion , yet his will and driving force waxed rather than waned , and he refused to be confined to his bed .
the lassitude of his earlier ill days gave place to a return of his fiery purpose , so that he seemed about to hurl defiance at the even as that ancient enemy seized him .
the pretence of eating , always curiously like a formality with him , he virtually abandoned ; and mental power alone appeared to keep him from total collapse .
he acquired a habit of writing long documents of some sort , which he carefully sealed and filled with injunctions that i transmit them after his death to certain persons whom he named for the most part lettered east indians , but including a once celebrated french physician now generally thought dead , and about whom the most inconceivable things had been whispered .
as it happened , i burned all these papers undelivered and unopened .
his aspect and voice became utterly frightful , and his presence almost unbearable .
one september day an unexpected glimpse of him induced an epileptic fit in a man who had come to repair his electric desk lamp ; a fit for which he prescribed effectively whilst keeping himself well out of sight .
that man , oddly enough , had been through the terrors of the great war without having incurred any fright so thorough .
then , in the middle of october , the horror of horrors came with stupefying suddenness .
one night about eleven the pump of the refrigerating machine broke down , so that within three hours the process of ammonia cooling became impossible .
muñoz summoned me by thumping on the floor , and i worked desperately to repair the injury while my host cursed in a tone whose lifeless , rattling hollowness surpassed description .
my amateur efforts , however , proved of no use ; and when i had brought in a mechanic from a neighbouring garage , we learned that nothing could be done till morning , when a new piston would have to be obtained .
the moribund hermit rage and fear , swelling to grotesque proportions , seemed likely to shatter what remained of his failing physique , and once a spasm caused him to clap his hands to his eyes and rush into the bathroom .
he groped his way out with face tightly bandaged , and i never saw his eyes again .
the frigidity of the apartment was now sensibly diminishing , and at about the doctor retired to the bathroom , commanding me to keep him supplied with all the ice i could obtain at drug stores and cafeterias .
as i would return from my sometimes discouraging trips and lay my spoils before the closed bathroom door , i could hear a restless splashing within , and a thick voice croaking out the order for more more !
at length a warm day broke , and the shops opened one by one .
i asked esteban either to help with the whilst i obtained the pump piston , or to order the piston while i continued with the ice ; but instructed by his mother , he absolutely refused .
finally i hired a loafer whom i encountered on the corner of eighth avenue to keep the patient supplied with ice from a little shop where i introduced him , and applied myself diligently to the task of finding a pump piston and engaging workmen competent to install it .
the task seemed interminable , and i raged almost as violently as the hermit when i saw the hours slipping by in a breathless , foodless round of vain telephoning , and a hectic quest from place to place , hither and thither by subway and surface car .
about noon i encountered a suitable supply house far downtown , and at approximately arrived at my with the necessary paraphernalia and two sturdy and intelligent mechanics .
i had done all i could , and hoped i was in time .
black terror , however , had preceded me .
the house was in utter turmoil , and above the chatter of awed voices i heard a man praying in a deep basso .
fiendish things were in the air , and lodgers told over the beads of their rosaries as they caught the odour from beneath the doctor closed door .
the lounger i had hired , it seems , had fled screaming and not long after his second delivery of ice ; perhaps as a result of excessive curiosity .
he could not , of course , have locked the door behind him ; yet it was now fastened , presumably from the inside .
there was no sound within save a nameless sort of slow , thick dripping .
briefly consulting with herrero and the workmen despite a fear that gnawed my inmost soul , i advised the breaking down of the door ; but the landlady found a way to turn the key from the outside with some wire device .
we had previously opened the doors of all the other rooms on that hall , and flung all the windows to the very top .
now , noses protected by handkerchiefs , we tremblingly invaded the accursed south room which blazed with the warm sun of early afternoon .
a kind of dark , slimy trail led from the open bathroom door to the hall door , and thence to the desk , where a terrible little pool had accumulated .
something was scrawled there in pencil in an awful , blind hand on a piece of paper hideously smeared as though by the very claws that traced the hurried last words .
then the trail led to the couch and ended unutterably .
what was , or had been , on the couch i can not and dare not say here .
but this is what i shiveringly puzzled out on the stickily smeared paper before i drew a match and burned it to a crisp ; what i puzzled out in terror as the landlady and two mechanics rushed frantically from that hellish place to babble their incoherent stories at the nearest police station .
the nauseous words seemed incredible in that yellow sunlight , with the clatter of cars and motor trucks ascending clamorously from crowded fourteenth street , yet i confess that i believed them then .
whether i believe them now i honestly do not know .
there are things about which it is better not to speculate , and all that i can say is that i hate the smell of ammonia , and grow faint at a draught of unusually cool air .
the end , ran that noisome scrawl , is here .
no more ice the man looked and ran away .
warmer every minute , and the tissues ca last .
i fancy you know what i said about the will and the nerves and the preserved body after the organs ceased to work .
it was good theory , but could keep up indefinitely .
there was a gradual deterioration i had not foreseen .
torres knew , but the shock killed him .
he could stand what he had to do he had to get me in a strange , dark place when he minded my letter and nursed me back .
and the organs never would work again .
it had to be done my way preservation for you see i died that time eighteen years ago .
i am writing this under an appreciable mental strain , since by tonight i shall be no more .
penniless , and at the end of my supply of the drug which alone makes life endurable , i can bear the torture no longer ; and shall cast myself from this garret window into the squalid street below .
do not think from my slavery to morphine that i am a weakling or a degenerate .
when you have read these hastily scrawled pages you may guess , though never fully realise , why it is that i must have forgetfulness or death .
it was in one of the most open and least frequented parts of the broad pacific that the packet of which i was supercargo fell a victim to the german .
the great war was then at its very beginning , and the ocean forces of the hun had not completely sunk to their later degradation ; so that our vessel was made legitimate prize , whilst we of her crew were treated with all the fairness and consideration due us as naval prisoners .
so liberal , indeed , was the discipline of our captors , that five days after we were taken i managed to escape alone in a small boat with water and provisions for a good length of time .
when i finally found myself adrift and free , i had but little idea of my surroundings .
never a competent navigator , i could only guess vaguely by the sun and stars that i was somewhat south of the equator .
of the longitude i knew nothing , and no island or was in sight .
the weather kept fair , and for uncounted days i drifted aimlessly beneath the scorching sun ; waiting either for some passing ship , or to be cast on the shores of some habitable land .
but neither ship nor land appeared , and i began to despair in my solitude upon the heaving vastnesses of unbroken blue .
the change happened whilst i slept .
its details i shall never know ; for my slumber , though troubled and , was continuous .
when at last i awaked , it was to discover myself half sucked into a slimy expanse of hellish black mire which extended about me in monotonous undulations as far as i could see , and in which my boat lay grounded some distance away .
though one might well imagine that my first sensation would be of wonder at so prodigious and unexpected a transformation of scenery , i was in reality more horrified than astonished ; for there was in the air and in the rotting soil a sinister quality which chilled me to the very core .
the region was putrid with the carcasses of decaying fish , and of other less describable things which i saw protruding from the nasty mud of the unending plain .
perhaps i should not hope to convey in mere words the unutterable hideousness that can dwell in absolute silence and barren immensity .
there was nothing within hearing , and nothing in sight save a vast reach of black slime ; yet the very completeness of the stillness and homogeneity of the landscape oppressed me with a nauseating fear .
the sun was blazing down from a sky which seemed to me almost black in its cloudless cruelty ; as though reflecting the inky marsh beneath my feet .
as i crawled into the stranded boat i realised that only one theory could explain my position .
through some unprecedented volcanic upheaval , a portion of the ocean floor must have been thrown to the surface , exposing regions which for innumerable millions of years had lain hidden under unfathomable watery depths .
so great was the extent of the new land which had risen beneath me , that i could not detect the faintest noise of the surging ocean , strain my ears as i might .
nor were there any to prey upon the dead things .
for several hours i sat thinking or brooding in the boat , which lay upon its side and afforded a slight shade as the sun moved across the heavens .
as the day progressed , the ground lost some of its stickiness , and seemed likely to dry sufficiently for travelling purposes in a short time .
that night i slept but little , and the next day i made for myself a pack containing food and water , preparatory to an overland journey in search of the vanished sea and possible rescue .
on the third morning i found the soil dry enough to walk upon with ease .
the odour of the fish was maddening ; but i was too much concerned with graver things to mind so slight an evil , and set out boldly for an unknown goal .
all day i forged steadily westward , guided by a hummock which rose higher than any other elevation on the rolling desert .
that night i encamped , and on the following day still travelled toward the hummock , though that object seemed scarcely nearer than when i had first espied it .
by the fourth evening i attained the base of the mound which turned out to be much higher than it had appeared from a distance , an intervening valley setting it out in sharper relief from the general surface .
too weary to ascend , i slept in the shadow of the hill .
i know not why my dreams were so wild that night ; but ere the waning and fantastically gibbous moon had risen far above the eastern plain , i was awake in a cold perspiration , determined to sleep no more .
such visions as i had experienced were too much for me to endure again .
and in the glow of the moon i saw how unwise i had been to travel by day .
without the glare of the parching sun , my journey would have cost me less energy ; indeed , i now felt quite able to perform the ascent which had deterred me at sunset .
picking up my pack , i started for the crest of the eminence .
i have said that the unbroken monotony of the rolling plain was a source of vague horror to me ; but i think my horror was greater when i gained the summit of the mound and looked down the other side into an immeasurable pit or canyon , whose black recesses the moon had not yet soard high enough to illuminate .
i felt myself on the edge of the world ; peering over the rim into a fathomless chaos of eternal night .
through my terror ran curious reminiscences of paradise lost , and of satan hideous climb through the unfashioned realms of darkness .
as the moon climbed higher in the sky , i began to see that the slopes of the valley were not quite so perpendicular as i had imagined .
ledges and outcroppings of rock afforded fairly easy for a descent , whilst after a drop of a few hundred feet , the declivity became very gradual .
urged on by an impulse which i can not definitely analyse , i scrambled with difficulty down the rocks and stood on the gentler slope beneath , gazing into the stygian deeps where no light had yet penetrated .
all at once my attention was captured by a vast and singular object on the opposite slope , which rose steeply about an hundred yards ahead of me ; an object that gleamed whitely in the newly bestowed rays of the ascending moon .
that it was merely a gigantic piece of stone , i soon assured myself ; but i was conscious of a distinct impression that its contour and position were not altogether the work of nature .
a closer scrutiny filled me with sensations i can not express ; for despite its enormous magnitude , and its position in an abyss which had yawned at the bottom of the sea since the world was young , i perceived beyond a doubt that the strange object was a monolith whose massive bulk had known the workmanship and perhaps the worship of living and thinking creatures .
dazed and frightened , yet not without a certain thrill of the scientist or archaeologist delight , i examined my surroundings more closely .
the moon , now near the zenith , shone weirdly and vividly above the towering steeps that hemmed in the chasm , and revealed the fact that a body of water flowed at the bottom , winding out of sight in both directions , and almost lapping my feet as i stood on the slope .
across the chasm , the wavelets washed the base of the cyclopean monolith ; on whose surface i could now trace both inscriptions and crude sculptures .
the writing was in a system of hieroglyphics unknown to me , and unlike anything i had ever seen in books ; consisting for the most part of conventionalised aquatic symbols such as fishes , eels , octopi , crustaceans , molluscs , whales , and the like .
several characters obviously represented marine things which are unknown to the modern world , but whose decomposing forms i had observed on the plain .
it was the pictorial carving , however , that did most to hold me spellbound .
plainly visible across the intervening water on account of their enormous size , were an array of whose subjects would have excited the envy of doré .
i think that these things were supposed to depict men at least , a certain sort of men ; though the creatures were shewn disporting like fishes in waters of some marine grotto , or paying homage at some monolithic shrine which appeared to be under the waves as well .
of their faces and forms i dare not speak in detail ; for the mere remembrance makes me grow faint .
grotesque beyond the imagination of a poe or a bulwer , they were damnably human in general outline despite webbed hands and feet , shockingly wide and flabby lips , glassy , bulging eyes , and other features less pleasant to recall .
curiously enough , they seemed to have been chiselled badly out of proportion with their scenic background ; for one of the creatures was shewn in the act of killing a whale represented as but little larger than himself .
i remarked , as i say , their grotesqueness and strange size , but in a moment decided that they were merely the imaginary gods of some primitive fishing or seafaring tribe ; some tribe whose last descendant had perished eras before the first ancestor of the piltdown or neanderthal man was born .
awestruck at this unexpected glimpse into a past beyond the conception of the most daring anthropologist , i stood musing whilst the moon cast queer reflections on the silent channel before me .
then suddenly i saw it .
with only a slight churning to mark its rise to the surface , the thing slid into view above the dark waters .
vast , , and loathsome , it darted like a stupendous monster of nightmares to the monolith , about which it flung its gigantic scaly arms , the while it bowed its hideous head and gave vent to certain measured sounds .
i think i went mad then .
of my frantic ascent of the slope and cliff , and of my delirious journey back to the stranded boat , i remember little .
i believe i sang a great deal , and laughed oddly when i was unable to sing .
i have indistinct recollections of a great storm some time after i reached the boat ; at any rate , i know that i heard peals of thunder and other tones which nature utters only in her wildest moods .
when i came out of the shadows i was in a san francisco hospital ; brought thither by the captain of the american ship which had picked up my boat in .
in my delirium i had said much , but found that my words had been given scant attention .
of any land upheaval in the pacific , my rescuers knew nothing ; nor did i deem it necessary to insist upon a thing which i knew they could not believe .
once i sought out a celebrated enthnologist , and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient philistine legend of dagon , the ; but soon perceiving that he was hopelessly conventional , i did not press my inquiries .
it is at night , especially when the moon is gibbous and waning , that i see the thing .
i tried morphine ; but the drug has given only transient surcease , and has drawn me into its clutches as a hopeless slave .
so now i am to end it all , having written a full account for the information or the contemptuous amusement of my .
often i ask myself if it could not all have been a pure phantasm a mere freak of fever as i lay and raving in the open boat after my escape from the german .
this i ask myself , but ever does there come before me a hideously vivid vision in reply .
i can not think of the deep sea without shuddering at the nameless things that may at this very moment be crawling and floundering on its slimy bed , worshipping their ancient stone idols and carving their own detestable likenesses on the submarine obelisks of granite .
i dream of a day when they may rise above the billows to drag down in their reeking talons the remnants of puny , mankind of a day when the land shall sink , and the dark ocean floor shall ascend amidst universal pandemonium .
the end is near .
i hear a noise at the door , as of some immense slippery body lumbering against it .
it shall find me .
god , that hand !
the window !
the window !
when the last days were upon me , and the ugly trifles of existence began to drive me to madness like the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly upon one spot of their victims body , i loved the irradiate refuge of sleep .
in my dreams i found a little of the beauty i had vainly sought in life , and wandered through old gardens and enchanted woods .
once when the wind was soft and scented i heard the south calling , and sailed endlessly and languorously under strange stars .
once when the gentle rain fell i glided in a barge down a sunless stream under the earth till i reached another world of purple twilight , iridescent arbours , and undying roses .
and once i walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy groves and ruins , and ended in a mighty wall green with antique vines , and pierced by a little gate of bronze .
many times i walked through that valley , and longer and longer would i pause in the spectral where the giant trees squirmed and twisted grotesquely , and the grey ground stretched damply from trunk to trunk , sometimes disclosing the stones of buried temples .
and always the goal of my fancies was the mighty wall with the little gate of bronze therein .
after awhile , as the days of waking became less and less bearable from their greyness and sameness , i would often drift in opiate peace through the valley and the shadowy groves , and wonder how i might seize them for my eternal , so that i need no more crawl back to a dull world stript of interest and new colours .
and as i looked upon the little gate in the mighty wall , i felt that beyond it lay a from which , once it was entered , there would be no return .
so each night in sleep i strove to find the hidden latch of the gate in the ivied antique wall , though it was exceedingly well hidden .
and i would tell myself that the realm beyond the wall was not more lasting merely , but more lovely and radiant as well .
then one night in the of zakarion i found a yellowed papyrus filled with the thoughts of who dwelt of old in that city , and who were too wise ever to be born in the waking world .
therein were written many things concerning the world of dream , and among them was lore of a golden valley and a sacred grove with temples , and a high wall pierced by a little bronze gate .
when i saw this lore , i knew that it touched on the scenes i had haunted , and i therefore read long in the yellowed papyrus .
some of the wrote gorgeously of the wonders beyond the irrepassable gate , but others told of horror and disappointment .
i knew not which to believe , yet longed more and more to cross forever into the unknown land ; for doubt and secrecy are the lure of lures , and no new horror can be more terrible than the daily torture of the commonplace .
so when i learned of the drug which would unlock the gate and drive me through , i resolved to take it when next i awaked .
last night i swallowed the drug and floated dreamily into the golden valley and the shadowy groves ; and when i came this time to the antique wall , i saw that the small gate of bronze was ajar .
from beyond came a glow that weirdly lit the giant twisted trees and the tops of the buried temples , and i drifted on songfully , expectant of the glories of the land from whence i should never return .
but as the gate swung wider and the sorcery of the drug and the dream pushed me through , i knew that all sights and glories were at an end ; for in that new realm was neither land nor sea , but only the white void of unpeopled and illimitable space .
so , happier than i had ever dared hope to be , i dissolved again into that native infinity of crystal oblivion from which the daemon life had called me for one brief and desolate hour .
i life is a hideous thing , and from the background behind what we know of it peer daemoniacal hints of truth which make it sometimes a thousandfold more hideous .
science , already oppressive with its shocking revelations , will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species if separate species we be for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world .
if we knew what we are , we should do as sir arthur jermyn did ; and arthur jermyn soaked himself in oil and set fire to his clothing one night .
no one placed the charred fragments in an urn or set a memorial to him who had been ; for certain papers and a certain boxed object were found which made men wish to forget .
some who knew him do not admit that he ever existed .
arthur jermyn went out on the moor and burned himself after seeing the boxed object which had come from africa .
it was this object , and not his peculiar personal appearance , which made him end his life .
many would have disliked to live if possessed of the peculiar features of arthur jermyn , but he had been a poet and scholar and had not minded .
learning was in his blood , for his , sir robert jermyn , , had been an anthropologist of note , whilst his great , sir wade jermyn , was one of the earliest explorers of the congo region , and had written eruditely of its tribes , animals , and supposed antiquities .
indeed , old sir wade had possessed an intellectual zeal amounting almost to a mania ; his bizarre conjectures on a prehistoric white congolese civilisation earning him much ridicule when his book , observation on the several parts of africa , was published .
in this fearless explorer had been placed in a madhouse at huntingdon .
madness was in all the jermyns , and people were glad there were not many of them .
the line put forth no branches , and arthur was the last of it .
if he had not been , one can not say what he would have done when the object came .
the jermyns never seemed to look quite right something was amiss , though arthur was the worst , and the old family portraits in jermyn house showed fine faces enough before sir wade time .
certainly , the madness began with sir wade , whose wild stories of africa were at once the delight and terror of his few friends .
it showed in his collection of trophies and specimens , which were not such as a normal man would accumulate and preserve , and appeared strikingly in the oriental seclusion in which he kept his wife .
the latter , he had said , was the daughter of a portuguese trader whom he had met in africa ; and did not like english ways .
she , with an infant son born in africa , had accompanied him back from the second and longest of his trips , and had gone with him on the third and last , never returning .
no one had ever seen her closely , not even the servants ; for her disposition had been violent and singular .
during her brief stay at jermyn house she occupied a remote wing , and was waited on by her husband alone .
sir wade was , indeed , most peculiar in his solicitude for his family ; for when he returned to africa he would permit no one to care for his young son save a loathsome black woman from guinea .
upon coming back , after the death of lady jermyn , he himself assumed complete care of the boy .
but it was the talk of sir wade , especially when in his cups , which chiefly led his friends to deem him mad .
in a rational age like the eighteenth century it was unwise for a man of learning to talk about wild sights and strange scenes under a congo moon ; of the gigantic walls and pillars of a forgotten city , crumbling and , and of damp , silent , stone steps leading interminably down into the darkness of abysmal and inconceivable catacombs .
especially was it unwise to rave of the living things that might haunt such a place ; of creatures half of the jungle and half of the impiously aged city fabulous creatures which even a pliny might describe with scepticism ; things that might have sprung up after the great apes had overrun the dying city with the walls and the pillars , the vaults and the weird carvings .
yet after he came home for the last time sir wade would speak of such matters with a shudderingly uncanny zest , mostly after his third glass at the knight head ; boasting of what he had found in the jungle and of how he had dwelt among terrible ruins known only to him .
and finally he had spoken of the living things in such a manner that he was taken to the madhouse .
he had shown little regret when shut into the barred room at huntingdon , for his mind moved curiously .
ever since his son had commenced to grow out of infancy , he had liked his home less and less , till at last he had seemed to dread it .
the knight head had been his headquarters , and when he was confined he expressed some vague gratitude as if for protection .
three years later he died .
wade jermyn son philip was a highly peculiar person .
despite a strong physical resemblance to his father , his appearance and conduct were in many particulars so coarse that he was universally shunned .
though he did not inherit the madness which was feared by some , he was densely stupid and given to brief periods of uncontrollable violence .
in frame he was small , but intensely powerful , and was of incredible agility .
twelve years after succeeding to his title he married the daughter of his gamekeeper , a person said to be of gypsy extraction , but before his son was born joined the navy as a common sailor , completing the general disgust which his habits and misalliance had begun .
after the close of the american war he was heard of as sailor on a merchantman in the african trade , having a kind of reputation for feats of strength and climbing , but finally disappearing one night as his ship lay off the congo coast .
in the son of sir philip jermyn the now accepted family peculiarity took a strange and fatal turn .
tall and fairly handsome , with a sort of weird eastern grace despite certain slight oddities of proportion , robert jermyn began life as a scholar and investigator .
it was he who first studied scientifically the vast collection of relics which his mad grandfather had brought from africa , and who made the family name as celebrated in ethnology as in exploration .
in sir robert married a daughter of the seventh viscount brightholme and was subsequently blessed with three children , the eldest and youngest of whom were never publicly seen on account of deformities in mind and body .
saddened by these family misfortunes , the scientist sought relief in work , and made two long expeditions in the interior of africa .
in his second son , nevil , a singularly repellent person who seemed to combine the surliness of philip jermyn with the hauteur of the brightholmes , ran away with a vulgar dancer , but was pardoned upon his return in the following year .
he came back to jermyn house a widower with an infant son , alfred , who was one day to be the father of arthur jermyn .
friends said that it was this series of griefs which unhinged the mind of sir robert jermyn , yet it was probably merely a bit of african folklore which caused the disaster .
the elderly scholar had been collecting legends of the onga tribes near the field of his grandfather and his own explorations , hoping in some way to account for sir wade wild tales of a lost city peopled by strange hybrid creatures .
a certain consistency in the strange papers of his ancestor suggested that the madman imagination might have been stimulated by native myths .
on october , , the explorer samuel seaton called at jermyn house with a manuscript of notes collected among the ongas , believing that certain legends of a gray city of white apes ruled by a white god might prove valuable to the ethnologist .
in his conversation he probably supplied many additional details ; the nature of which will never be known , since a hideous series of tragedies suddenly burst into being .
when sir robert jermyn emerged from his library he left behind the strangled corpse of the explorer , and before he could be restrained , had put an end to all three of his children ; the two who were never seen , and the son who had run away .
nevil jermyn died in the successful defence of his own son , who had apparently been included in the old man madly murderous scheme .
sir robert himself , after repeated attempts at suicide and a stubborn refusal to utter an articulate sound , died of apoplexy in the second year of his confinement .
sir alfred jermyn was a baronet before his fourth birthday , but his tastes never matched his title .
at twenty he had joined a band of performers , and at had deserted his wife and child to travel with an itinerant american circus .
his end was very revolting .
among the animals in the exhibition with which he travelled was a huge bull gorilla of lighter colour than the average ; a surprisingly tractable beast of much popularity with the performers .
with this gorilla alfred jermyn was singularly fascinated , and on many occasions the two would eye each other for long periods through the intervening bars .
eventually jermyn asked and obtained permission to train the animal , astonishing audiences and fellow performers alike with his success .
one morning in chicago , as the gorilla and alfred jermyn were rehearsing an exceedingly clever boxing match , the former delivered a blow of more than the usual force , hurting both the body and the dignity of the amateur trainer .
of what followed , members of the greatest show on earth do not like to speak .
they did not expect to hear sir alfred jermyn emit a shrill , inhuman scream , or to see him seize his clumsy antagonist with both hands , dash it to the floor of the cage , and bite fiendishly at its hairy throat .
the gorilla was off its guard , but not for long , and before anything could be done by the regular trainer , the body which had belonged to a baronet was past recognition .
arthur jermyn was the son of sir alfred jermyn and a singer of unknown origin .
when the husband and father deserted his family , the mother took the child to jermyn house ; where there was none left to object to her presence .
she was not without notions of what a nobleman dignity should be , and saw to it that her son received the best education which limited money could provide .
the family resources were now sadly slender , and jermyn house had fallen into woeful disrepair , but young arthur loved the old edifice and all its contents .
he was not like any other jermyn who had ever lived , for he was a poet and a dreamer .
some of the neighbouring families who had heard tales of old sir wade jermyn unseen portuguese wife declared that her latin blood must be showing itself ; but most persons merely sneered at his sensitiveness to beauty , attributing it to his music hall mother , who was socially unrecognised .
the poetic delicacy of arthur jermyn was the more remarkable because of his uncouth personal appearance .
most of the jermyns had possessed a subtly odd and repellent cast , but arthur case was very striking .
it is hard to say just what he resembled , but his expression , his facial angle , and the length of his arms gave a thrill of repulsion to those who met him for the first time .
it was the mind and character of arthur jermyn which atoned for his aspect .
gifted and learned , he took highest honours at oxford and seemed likely to redeem the intellectual fame of his family .
though of poetic rather than scientific temperament , he planned to continue the work of his forefathers in african ethnology and antiquities , utilising the truly wonderful though strange collection of sir wade .
with his fanciful mind he thought often of the prehistoric civilisation in which the mad explorer had so implicitly believed , and would weave tale after tale about the silent jungle city mentioned in the latter wilder notes and paragraphs .
for the nebulous utterances concerning a nameless , unsuspected race of jungle hybrids he had a peculiar feeling of mingled terror and attraction , speculating on the possible basis of such a fancy , and seeking to obtain light among the more recent data gleaned by his and samuel seaton amongst the ongas .
in , after the death of his mother , sir arthur jermyn determined to pursue his investigations to the utmost extent .
selling a portion of his estate to obtain the requisite money , he outfitted an expedition and sailed for the congo .
arranging with the belgian authorities for a party of guides , he spent a year in the onga and kahn country , finding data beyond the highest of his expectations .
among the kaliris was an aged chief called mwanu , who possessed not only a highly retentive memory , but a singular degree of intelligence and interest in old legends .
this ancient confirmed every tale which jermyn had heard , adding his own account of the stone city and the white apes as it had been told to him .
according to mwanu , the gray city and the hybrid creatures were no more , having been annihilated by the warlike many years ago .
this tribe , after destroying most of the edifices and killing the live beings , had carried off the stuffed goddess which had been the object of their quest ; the white which the strange beings worshipped , and which was held by congo tradition to be the form of one who had reigned as a princess among these beings .
just what the white apelike creatures could have been , mwanu had no idea , but he thought they were the builders of the ruined city .
jermyn could form no conjecture , but by close questioning obtained a very picturesque legend of the stuffed goddess .
the , it was said , became the consort of a great white god who had come out of the west .
for a long time they had reigned over the city together , but when they had a son , all three went away .
later the god and princess had returned , and upon the death of the princess her divine husband had mummified the body and enshrined it in a vast house of stone , where it was worshipped .
then he departed alone .
the legend here seemed to present three variants .
according to one story , nothing further happened save that the stuffed goddess became a symbol of supremacy for whatever tribe might possess it .
it was for this reason that the carried it off .
a second story told of a god return and death at the feet of his enshrined wife .
a third told of the return of the son , grown to manhood or apehood or godhood , as the case might be yet unconscious of his identity .
surely the imaginative blacks had made the most of whatever events might lie behind the extravagant legendry .
of the reality of the jungle city described by old sir wade , arthur jermyn had no further doubt ; and was hardly astonished when early in he came upon what was left of it .
its size must have been exaggerated , yet the stones lying about proved that it was no mere negro village .
unfortunately no carvings could be found , and the small size of the expedition prevented operations toward clearing the one visible passageway that seemed to lead down into the system of vaults which sir wade had mentioned .
the white apes and the stuffed goddess were discussed with all the native chiefs of the region , but it remained for a european to improve on the data offered by old mwanu .
verhaeren , belgian agent at a on the congo , believed that he could not only locate but obtain the stuffed goddess , of which he had vaguely heard ; since the once mighty were now the submissive servants of king albert government , and with but little persuasion could be induced to part with the gruesome deity they had carried off .
when jermyn sailed for england , therefore , it was with the exultant probability that he would within a few months receive a priceless ethnological relic confirming the wildest of his great narratives that is , the wildest which he had ever heard .
countrymen near jermyn house had perhaps heard wilder tales handed down from ancestors who had listened to sir wade around the tables of the knight head .
arthur jermyn waited very patiently for the expected box from verhaeren , meanwhile studying with increased diligence the manuscripts left by his mad ancestor .
he began to feel closely akin to sir wade , and to seek relics of the latter personal life in england as well as of his african exploits .
oral accounts of the mysterious and secluded wife had been numerous , but no tangible relic of her stay at jermyn house remained .
jermyn wondered what circumstance had prompted or permitted such an effacement , and decided that the husband insanity was the prime cause .
his , he recalled , was said to have been the daughter of a portuguese trader in africa .
no doubt her practical heritage and superficial knowledge of the dark continent had caused her to flout sir wade tales of the interior , a thing which such a man would not be likely to forgive .
she had died in africa , perhaps dragged thither by a husband determined to prove what he had told .
but as jermyn indulged in these reflections he could not but smile at their futility , a century and a half after the death of both his strange progenitors .
in june , , a letter arrived from verhaeren , telling of the finding of the stuffed goddess .
it was , the belgian averred , a most extraordinary object ; an object quite beyond the power of a layman to classify .
whether it was human or simian only a scientist could determine , and the process of determination would be greatly hampered by its imperfect condition .
time and the congo climate are not kind to mummies ; especially when their preparation is as amateurish as seemed to be the case here .
around the creature neck had been found a golden chain bearing an empty locket on which were armorial designs ; no doubt some hapless traveller keepsake , taken by the and hung upon the goddess as a charm .
in commenting on the contour of the mummy face , verhaeren suggested a whimsical comparison ; or rather , expressed a humorous wonder just how it would strike his corespondent , but was too much interested scientifically to waste many words in levity .
the stuffed goddess , he wrote , would arrive duly packed about a month after receipt of the letter .
the boxed object was delivered at jermyn house on the afternoon of august , , being conveyed immediately to the large chamber which housed the collection of african specimens as arranged by sir robert and arthur .
what ensued can best be gathered from the tales of servants and from things and papers later examined .
of the various tales , that of aged soames , the family butler , is most ample and coherent .
according to this trustworthy man , sir arthur jermyn dismissed everyone from the room before opening the box , though the instant sound of hammer and chisel showed that he did not delay the operation .
nothing was heard for some time ; just how long soames can not exactly estimate , but it was certainly less than a quarter of an hour later that the horrible scream , undoubtedly in jermyn voice , was heard .
immediately afterward jermyn emerged from the room , rushing frantically toward the front of the house as if pursued by some hideous enemy .
the expression on his face , a face ghastly enough in repose , was beyond description .
when near the front door he seemed to think of something , and turned back in his flight , finally disappearing down the stairs to the cellar .
the servants were utterly dumbfounded , and watched at the head of the stairs , but their master did not return .
a smell of oil was all that came up from the regions below .
after dark a rattling was heard at the door leading from the cellar into the courtyard ; and a saw arthur jermyn , glistening from head to foot with oil and redolent of that fluid , steal furtively out and vanish on the black moor surrounding the house .
then , in an exaltation of supreme horror , everyone saw the end .
a spark appeared on the moor , a flame arose , and a pillar of human fire reached to the heavens .
the house of jermyn no longer existed .
the reason why arthur jermyn charred fragments were not collected and buried lies in what was found afterward , principally the thing in the box .
the stuffed goddess was a nauseous sight , withered and eaten away , but it was clearly a mummified white ape of some unknown species , less hairy than any recorded variety , and infinitely nearer mankind quite shockingly so .
detailed description would be rather unpleasant , but two salient particulars must be told , for they fit in revoltingly with certain notes of sir wade jermyn african expeditions and with the congolese legends of the white god and the .
the two particulars in question are these the arms on the golden locket about the creature neck were the jermyn arms , and the jocose suggestion of verhaeren about certain resemblance as connected with the shrivelled face applied with vivid , ghastly , and unnatural horror to none other than the sensitive arthur jermyn , of sir wade jermyn and an unknown wife .
members of the royal anthropological institute burned the thing and threw the locket into a well , and some of them do not admit that arthur jermyn ever existed .
that crawford tillinghast should ever have studied science and philosophy was a mistake .
these things should be left to the frigid and impersonal investigator for they offer two equally tragic alternatives to the man of feeling and action ; despair , if he fail in his quest , and terrors unutterable and unimaginable if he succeed .
tillinghast had once been the prey of failure , solitary and melancholy ; but now i knew , with nauseating fears of my own , that he was the prey of success .
i had indeed warned him ten weeks before , when he burst forth with his tale of what he felt himself about to discover .
he had been flushed and excited then , talking in a high and unnatural , though always pedantic , voice .
what do we know , he had said , of the world and the universe about us ?
our means of receiving impressions are absurdly few , and our notions of surrounding objects infinitely narrow .
we see things only as we are constructed to see them , and can gain no idea of their absolute nature .
with five feeble senses we pretend to comprehend the boundlessly complex cosmos , yet other beings with wider , stronger , or different range of senses might not only see very differently the things we see , but might see and study whole worlds of matter , energy , and life which lie close at hand yet can never be detected with the senses we have .
i have always believed that such strange , inaccessible worlds exist at our very elbows , and now i believe i have found a way to break dawn the barriers .
i am not joking .
within hours that machine near the table will generate waves acting on unrecognized sense organs that exist in us as atrophied or rudimentary vestiges .
those waves will open up to us many vistas unknown to man and several unknown to anything we consider organic life .
we shall see that at which dogs howl in the dark , and that at which cats prick up their ears after midnight .
we shall see these things , and other things which no breathing creature has yet seen .
we shall overleap time , space , and dimensions , and without bodily motion peer to the bottom of creation .
when tillinghast said these things i remonstrated , for i knew him well enough to be frightened rather than amused ; but he was a fanatic , and drove me from the house .
now he was no less a fanatic , but his desire to speak had conquered his resentment , and he had written me imperatively in a hand i could scarcely recognize .
as i entered the abode of the friend so suddenly metamorphosed to a shivering gargoyle , i became infected with the terror which seemed stalking in all the shadows .
the words and beliefs expressed ten weeks before seemed bodied forth in the darkness beyond the small circle of candle light , and i sickened at the hollow , altered voice of my host .
i wished the servants were about , and did not like it when he said they had all left three days previously .
it seemed strange that old gregory , at least , should desert his master without telling as tried a friend as i .
it was he who had given me all the information i had of tillinghast after i was repulsed in rage .
yet i soon subordinated all my fears to my growing curiosity and fascination .
just what crawford tillinghast now wished of me i could only guess , but that he had some stupendous secret or discovery to impart , i could not doubt .
before i had protested at his unnatural pryings into the unthinkable ; now that he had evidently succeeded to some degree i almost shared his spirit , terrible though the cost of victory appeared .
up through the dark emptiness of the house i followed the bobbing candle in the hand of this shaking parody on man .
the electricity seemed to be turned off , and when i asked my guide he said it was for a definite reason .
it would be too much i would not dare , he continued to mutter .
i especially noted his new habit of muttering , for it was not like him to talk to himself .
we entered the laboratory in the attic , and i observed that detestable electrical machine , glowing with a sickly , sinister violet luminosity .
it was connected with a powerful chemical battery , but seemed to be receiving no current ; for i recalled that in its experimental stage it had sputtered and purred when in action .
in reply to my question tillinghast mumbled that this permanent glow was not electrical in any sense that i could understand .
he now seated me near the machine , so that it was on my right , and turned a switch somewhere below the crowning cluster of glass bulbs .
the usual sputtering began , turned to a whine , and terminated in a drone so soft as to suggest a return to silence .
meanwhile the luminosity increased , waned again , then assumed a pale , outrè colour or blend of colours which i could neither place nor describe .
tillinghast had been watching me , and noted my puzzled expression .
do you know what that is ?
he whispered , that is .
he chuckled oddly at my surprise .
you thought was invisible , and so it is but you can see that and many other invisible things now .
listen to me !
the waves from that thing are waking a thousand sleeping senses in us ; senses which we inherit from aeons of evolution from the state of detached electrons to the state of organic humanity .
i have seen the truth , and i intend to show it to you .
do you wonder how it will seem ?
i will tell you .
here tillinghast seated himself directly opposite me , blowing out his candle and staring hideously into my eyes .
your existing ears first , i think will pick up many of the impressions , for they are closely connected with the dormant organs .
then there will be others .
you have heard of the pineal gland ?
i laugh at the shallow endocrinologist , and of the freudian .
that gland is the great sense organ of organs i have found out .
it is like sight in the end , and transmits visual pictures to the brain .
if you are normal , that is the way you ought to get most of it i mean get most of the evidence from beyond .
i looked about the immense attic room with the sloping south wall , dimly lit by rays which the every day eye can not see .
the far corners were all shadows and the whole place took on a hazy unreality which obscured its nature and invited the imagination to symbolism and phantasm .
during the interval that tillinghast was long silent i fancied myself in some vast incredible temple of gods ; some vague edifice of innumerable black stone columns reaching up from a floor of damp slabs to a cloudy height beyond the range of my vision .
the picture was very vivid for a while , but gradually gave way to a more horrible conception ; that of utter , absolute solitude in infinite , sightless , soundless space .
there seemed to be a void , and nothing more , and i felt a childish fear which prompted me to draw from my hip pocket the revolver i carried after dark since the night i was held up in east providence .
then from the farthermost regions of remoteness , the sound softly glided into existence .
it was infinitely faint , subtly vibrant , and unmistakably musical , but held a quality of surpassing wildness which made its impact feel like a delicate torture of my whole body .
i felt sensations like those one feels when accidentally scratching ground glass .
simultaneously there developed something like a cold draught , which apparently swept past me from the direction of the distant sound .
as i waited breathlessly i perceived that both sound and wind were increasing ; the effect being to give me an odd notion of myself as tied to a pair of rails in the path of a gigantic approaching locomotive .
i began to speak to tillinghast , and as i did so all the unusual impressions abruptly vanished .
i saw only the man , the glowing machines , and the dim apartment .
tillinghast was grinning repulsively at the revolver which i had almost unconsciously drawn , but from his expression i was sure he had seen and heard as much as i , if not a great deal more .
i whispered what i had experienced and he bade me to remain as quiet and receptive as possible .
do move , he cautioned , for in these rays we are able to be seen as well as to see .
i told you the servants left , but i did tell you how .
it was that she turned on the lights downstairs after i had warned her not to , and the wires picked up sympathetic vibrations .
it must have been frightful i could hear the screams up here in spite of all i was seeing and hearing from another direction , and later it was rather awful to find those empty heaps of clothes around the house .
updike clothes were close to the front hall switch that how i know she did it .
it got them all .
but so long as we do move we fairly safe .
remember we dealing with a hideous world in which we are practically helpless keep still !
the combined shock of the revelation and of the abrupt command gave me a kind of paralysis , and in my terror my mind again opened to the impressions coming from what tillinghast called beyond .
i was now in a vortex of sound and motion , with confused pictures before my eyes .
i saw the blurred outlines of the room , but from some point in space there seemed to be pouring a seething column of unrecognizable shapes or clouds , penetrating the solid roof at a point ahead and to the right of me .
then i glimpsed the effect again , but this time the pillars reached up into an aerial ocean of light , which sent down one blinding beam along the path of the cloudy column i had seen before .
after that the scene was almost wholly kaleidoscopic , and in the jumble of sights , sounds , and unidentified i felt that i was about to dissolve or in some way lose the solid form .
one definite flash i shall always remember .
i seemed for an instant to behold a patch of strange night sky filled with shining , revolving spheres , and as it receded i saw that the glowing suns formed a constellation or galaxy of settled shape ; this shape being the distorted face of crawford tillinghast .
at another time i felt the huge animate things brushing past me and occasionally walking or drifting through my supposedly solid body , and thought i saw tillinghast look at them as though his better trained senses could catch them visually .
i recalled what he had said of the pineal gland , and wondered what he saw with this preternatural eye .
suddenly i myself became possessed of a kind of augmented sight .
over and above the luminous and shadowy chaos arose a picture which , though vague , held the elements of consistency and permanence .
it was indeed somewhat familiar , for the unusual part was superimposed upon the usual terrestrial scene much as a cinema view may be thrown upon the painted curtain of a theater .
i saw the attic laboratory , the electrical machine , and the unsightly form of tillinghast opposite me ; but of all the space unoccupied by familiar objects not one particle was vacant .
indescribable shapes both alive and otherwise were mixed in disgusting disarray , and close to every known thing were whole worlds of alien , unknown entities .
it likewise seemed that all the known things entered into the composition of other unknown things and vice versa .
foremost among the living objects were inky , jellyfish monstrosities which flabbily quivered in harmony with the vibrations from the machine .
they were present in loathsome profusion , and i saw to my horror that they overlapped ; that they were and capable of passing through one another and through what we know as solids .
these things were never still , but seemed ever floating about with some malignant purpose .
sometimes they appeared to devour one another , the attacker launching itself at its victim and instantaneously obliterating the latter from sight .
shudderingly i felt that i knew what had obliterated the unfortunate servants , and could not exclude the thing from my mind as i strove to observe other properties of the newly visible world that lies unseen around us .
but tillinghast had been watching me and was speaking .
you see them ?
you see them ?
you see the things that float and flop about you and through you every moment of your life ?
you see the creatures that form what men call the pure air and the blue sky ?
have i not succeeded in breaking down the barrier ; have i not shown you worlds that no other living men have seen ?
i heard his scream through the horrible chaos , and looked at the wild face thrust so offensively close to mine .
his eyes were pits of flame , and they glared at me with what i now saw was overwhelming hatred .
the machine droned detestably .
you think those floundering things wiped out the servants ?
fool , they are harmless !
but the servants are gone , are they ?
you tried to stop me ; you discouraged me when i needed every drop of encouragement i could get ; you were afraid of the cosmic truth , you damned coward , but now i got you !
what swept up the servants ?
what made them scream so loud ? do know , eh !
you know soon enough .
look at me listen to what i say do you suppose there are really any such things as time and magnitude ?
do you fancy there are such things as form or matter ?
i tell you , i have struck depths that your little brain ca picture .
i have seen beyond the bounds of infinity and drawn down demons from the stars i have harnessed the shadows that stride from world to world to sow death and madness space belongs to me , do you hear ?
things are hunting me now the things that devour and dissolve but i know how to elude them .
it is you they will get , as they got the servants stirring , dear sir ?
i told you it was dangerous to move , i have saved you so far by telling you to keep still saved you to see more sights and to listen to me .
if you had moved , they would have been at you long ago .
do worry , they wo hurt you .
they did hurt the servants it was the seeing that made the poor devils scream so .
my pets are not pretty , for they come out of places where aesthetic standards are very different .
disintegration is quite painless , i assure you but i want you to see them .
i almost saw them , but i knew how to stop .
you are curious ?
i always knew you were no scientist .
trembling , eh .
trembling with anxiety to see the ultimate things i have discovered .
why do you move , then ?
tired ?
well , do worry , my friend , for they are coming look , look , curse you , look it just over your left shoulder what remains to be told is very brief , and may be familiar to you from the newspaper accounts .
the police heard a shot in the old tillinghast house and found us there tillinghast dead and me unconscious .
they arrested me because the revolver was in my hand , but released me in three hours , after they found it was apoplexy which had finished tillinghast and saw that my shot had been directed at the noxious machine which now lay hopelessly shattered on the laboratory floor .
i did not tell very much of what i had seen , for i feared the coroner would be skeptical ; but from the evasive outline i did give , the doctor told me that i had undoubtedly been hypnotized by the vindictive and homicidal madman .
i wish i could believe that doctor .
it would help my shaky nerves if i could dismiss what i now have to think of the air and the sky about and above me .
i never feel alone or comfortable , and a hideous sense of pursuit sometimes comes chillingly on me when i am weary .
what prevents me from believing the doctor is one simple fact that the police never found the bodies of those servants whom they say crawford tillinghast murdered .
i saw him on a sleepless night when i was walking desperately to save my soul and my vision .
my coming to new york had been a mistake ; for whereas i had looked for poignant wonder and inspiration in the teeming labyrinths of ancient streets that twist endlessly from forgotten courts and squares and waterfronts to courts and squares and waterfronts equally forgotten , and in the cyclopean modern towers and pinnacles that rise blackly babylonian under waning moons , i had found instead only a sense of horror and oppression which threatened to master , paralyze , and annihilate me .
the disillusion had been gradual .
coming for the first time upon the town , i had seen it in the sunset from a bridge , majestic above its waters , its incredible peaks and pyramids rising flowerlike and delicate from pools of violet mist to play with the flaming clouds and the first stars of evening .
then it had lighted up window by window above the shimmering tides where lanterns nodded and glided and deep horns bayed weird harmonies , and had itself become a starry firmament of dream , redolent of faery music , and one with the marvels of carcassonne and samarcand and el dorado and all glorious and fabulous cities .
shortly afterward i was taken through those antique ways so dear to my fancy narrow , curving alleys and passages where rows of red georgian brick blinked with dormers above pillared doorways that had looked on gilded sedans and paneled coaches and in the first flush of realization of these things i thought i had indeed achieved such treasures as would make me in time a poet .
but success and happiness were not to be .
garish daylight showed only squalor and alienage and the noxious elephantiasis of climbing , spreading stone where the moon had hinted of loveliness and elder magic ; and the throngs of people that seethed through the streets were squat , swarthy strangers with hardened faces and narrow eyes , shrewd strangers without dreams and without kinship to the scenes about them , who could never mean aught to a man of the old folk , with the love of fair green lanes and white new england village steeples in his heart .
so instead of the poems i had hoped for , there came only a shuddering blackness and ineffable loneliness ; and i saw at last a fearful truth which no one had ever dared to breathe before the unwhisperable secret of secrets the fact that this city of stone and stridor is not a sentient perpetuation of old new york as london is of old london and paris of old paris , but that it is in fact quite dead , its sprawling body imperfectly embalmed and infested with queer animate things which have nothing to do with it as it was in life .
upon making this discovery i ceased to sleep comfortably ; though something of resigned tranquillity came back as i gradually formed the habit of keeping off the streets by day and venturing abroad only at night , when darkness calls forth what little of the past still hovers about , and old white doorways remember the stalwart forms that once passed through them .
with this mode of relief i even wrote a few poems , and still refrained from going home to my people lest i seem to crawl back ignobly in defeat .
then , on a sleepless night walk , i met the man .
it was in a grotesque hidden courtyard of the greenwich section , for there in my ignorance i had settled , having heard of the place as the natural home of poets and artists .
the archaic lanes and houses and unexpected bits of square and court had indeed delighted me , and when i found the poets and artists to be pretenders whose quaintness is tinsel and whose lives are a denial of all that pure beauty which is poetry and art , i stayed on for love of these venerable things .
i fancied them as they were in their prime , when greenwich was a placid village not yet engulfed by the town ; and in the hours before dawn , when all the revellers had slunk away , i used to wander alone among their cryptical windings and brood upon the curious arcana which generations must have deposited there .
this kept my soul alive , and gave me a few of those dreams and visions for which the poet far within me cried out .
the man came upon me at about two one cloudy august morning , as i was threading a series of detached courtyards ; now accessible only through the unlighted hallways of intervening buildings , but once forming parts of a continuous network of picturesque alleys .
i had heard of them by vague rumor , and realized that they could not be upon any map of today ; but the fact that they were forgotten only endeared them to me , so that i had sought them with twice my usual eagerness .
now that i had found them , my eagerness was again redoubled ; for something in their arrangement dimly hinted that they might be only a few of many such , with dark , dumb counterparts wedged obscurely betwixt high blank walls and deserted rear tenements , or lurking lamplessly behind archways unbetrayed by hordes of the or guarded by furtive and uncommunicative artists whose practises do not invite publicity or the light of day .
he spoke to me without invitation , noting my mood and glances as i studied certain knockered doorways above steps , the pallid glow of traceried transoms feebly lighting my face .
his own face was in shadow , and he wore a hat which somehow blended perfectly with the cloak he affected ; but i was subtly disquieted even before he addressed me .
his form was very slight ; thin almost to cadaverousness ; and his voice proved phenomenally soft and hollow , though not particularly deep .
he had , he said , noticed me several times at my wanderings ; and inferred that i resembled him in loving the vestiges of former years .
would i not like the guidance of one long practised in these explorations , and possessed of local information profoundly deeper than any which an obvious newcomer could possibly have gained ?
as he spoke , i caught a glimpse of his face in the yellow beam from a solitary attic window .
it was a noble , even a handsome elderly countenance ; and bore the marks of a lineage and refinement unusual for the age and place .
yet some quality about it disturbed me almost as much as its features pleased me perhaps it was too white , or too expressionless , or too much out of keeping with the locality , to make me feel easy or comfortable .
nevertheless i followed him ; for in those dreary days my quest for antique beauty and mystery was all that i had to keep my soul alive , and i reckoned it a rare favor of fate to fall in with one whose kindred seekings seemed to have penetrated so much farther than mine .
something in the night constrained the cloaked man to silence and for a long hour he led me forward without needless words ; making only the briefest of comments concerning ancient names and dates and changes , and directing my progress very largely by gestures as we squeezed through interstices , tiptoed through corridors clambered over brick walls , and once crawled on hands and knees through a low , arched passage of stone whose immense length and tortuous twistings effaced at last every hint of geographical location i had managed to preserve .
the things we saw were very old and marvelous , or at least they seemed so in the few straggling rays of light by which i viewed them , and i shall never forget the tottering ionic columns and fluted pilasters and iron fenceposts and windows and decorative fanlights that appeared to grow quainter and stranger the deeper we advanced into this inexhaustible maze of unknown antiquity .
we met no person , and as time passed the lighted windows became fewer and fewer .
the streetlights we first encountered had been of oil , and of the ancient lozenge pattern .
later i noticed some with candles ; and at last , after traversing a horrible unlighted court where my guide had to lead with his gloved hand through total blackness to a narrow wooded gate in a high wall , we came upon a fragment of alley lit only by lanterns in front of every seventh house unbelievably colonial tin lanterns with conical tops and holes punched in the sides .
this alley led steeply uphill more steeply than i thought possible in this part of new york and the upper end was blocked squarely by the wall of a private estate , beyond which i could see a pale cupola , and the tops of trees waving against a vague lightness in the sky .
in this wall was a small , gate of black oak , which the man proceeded to unlock with a ponderous key .
leading me within , he steered a course in utter blackness over what seemed to be a gravel path , and finally up a flight of stone steps to the door of the house , which he unlocked and opened for me .
we entered , and as we did so i grew faint from a reek of infinite mustiness which welled out to meet us , and which must have been the fruit of unwholesome centuries of decay .
my host appeared not to notice this , and in courtesy i kept silent as he piloted me up a curving stairway , across a hall , and into a room whose door i heard him lock behind us .
then i saw him pull the curtains of the three windows that barely showed themselves against the lightening sky ; after which he crossed to the mantel , struck flint and steel , lighted two candles of a candelabrum of twelve sconces , and made a gesture enjoining speech .
in this feeble radiance i saw that we were in a spacious , and paneled library dating from the first quarter of the eighteenth century , with splendid doorway pediments , a delightful doric cornice , and a magnificently carved overmantel with top .
above the crowded bookshelves at intervals along the walls were family portraits ; all tarnished to an enigmatical dimness , and bearing an unmistakable likeness to the man who now motioned me to a chair beside the graceful chippendale table .
before seating himself across the table from me , my host paused for a moment as if in embarrassment ; then , tardily removing his gloves , hat , and cloak , stood theatrically revealed in full costume from queued hair and neck ruffles to , silk hose , and the buckled shoes i had not previously noticed .
now slowly sinking into a chair , he commenced to eye me intently .
without his hat he took on an aspect of extreme age which was scarcely visible before , and i wondered if this unperceived mark of singular longevity were not one of the sources of my disquiet .
when he spoke at length , his soft , hollow , and carefully muffled voice not infrequently quavered ; and now and then i had great difficulty in following him as i listened with a thrill of amazement and alarm which grew each instant .
you behold , sir , my host began , a man of very eccentrical habits for whose costume no apology need be offered to one with your wit and inclinations .
reflecting upon better times , i have not scrupled to ascertain their ways , and adopt their dress and manners ; an indulgence which offends none if practised without ostentation .
it hath been my good fortune to retain the rural seat of my ancestors , swallowed though it was by two towns , first greenwich , which built up hither after , then new york , which joined on near .
there were many reasons for the close keeping of this place in my family , and i have not been remiss in discharging such obligations .
the squire who succeeded to it in studied sartain arts and made sartain discoveries , all connected with influences residing in this particular plot of ground , and eminently desarving of the strongest guarding .
some curious effects of these arts and discoveries i now purpose to show you , under the strictest secrecy ; and i believe i may rely on my judgement of men enough to have no distrust of either your interest or your fidelity .
he paused , but i could only nod my head .
i have said that i was alarmed , yet to my soul nothing was more deadly than the material daylight world of new york , and whether this man were a harmless eccentric or a wielder of dangerous arts , i had no choice save to follow him and slake my sense of wonder on whatever he might have to offer .
so i listened .
to my ancestor , he softly continued , there appeared to reside some very remarkable qualities in the will of mankind ; qualities having a dominance not only over the acts of one self and of others , but over every variety of force and substance in nature , and over many elements and dimensions deemed more universal than nature herself .
may i say that he flouted the sanctity of things as great as space and time and that he put to strange uses the rites of sartain red indians once encamped upon this hill ?
these indians showed choler when the place was built , and were plaguey pestilent in asking to visit the grounds at the full of the moon .
for years they stole over the wall each month when they could , and by stealth performed sartain acts .
then , in , the new squire catched them at their doings , and stood still at what he saw .
thereafter he bargained with them and exchanged the free access of his grounds for the exact inwardness of what they did , larning that their grandfathers got part of their custom from red ancestors and part from an old dutchman in the time of the .
arid pox on him , i afeared the squire must have sarved them monstrous bad rum whether or not by intent for a week after he larnt the secret he was the only man living that knew it .
you , sir , are the first outsider to be told there is a secret , and split me if i have risked tampering that much with the powers had ye not been so hot after bygone things .
i shuddered as the man grew colloquial and with the familiar speech of another day .
he went on .
but you must know , sir , that what the squire got from those mongrel savages was but a small part of the larning he came to have .
he had not been at oxford for nothing , nor talked to no account with an ancient chymist and astrologer in paris .
he was , in fine , made sensible that all the world is but the smoke of our intellects ; past the bidding of the vulgar , but by the wise to be puffed out and drawn in like any cloud of prime virginia tobacco .
what we want , we may make about us ; and what we do want , we may sweep away .
i wo say that all this is wholly true in body , but is sufficient true to furnish a very pretty spectacle now and then .
you , i conceive , would be tickled by a better sight of sartain other years than your fancy affords you ; so be pleased to hold back any fright at what i design to show .
come to the window and be quiet .
my host now took my hand to draw me to one of the two windows on the long side of the malodorous room , and at the first touch of his ungloved fingers i turned cold .
his flesh , though dry and firm , was of the quality of ice ; and i almost shrank away from his pulling .
but again i thought of the emptiness and horror of reality , and boldly prepared to follow whithersoever i might be led .
once at the window , the man drew apart the yellow silk curtains and directed my stare into the blackness outside .
for a moment i saw nothing save a myriad of tiny dancing lights , far , far before me .
then , as if in response to an insidious motion of my host hand , a flash of played over the scene , and i looked out upon a sea of luxuriant foliage foliage unpolluted , and not the sea of roofs to be expected by any normal mind .
on my right the hudson glittered wickedly , and in the distance ahead i saw the unhealthy shimmer of a vast salt marsh constellated with nervous fireflies .
the flash died , and an evil smile illumined the waxy face of the aged necromancer .
that was before my time before the new squire time .
pray let us try again .
i was faint , even fainter than the hateful modernity of that accursed city had made me .
good god !
i whispered , can you do that for any time ?
and as he nodded , and bared the black stumps of what had once been yellow fangs , i clutched at the curtains to prevent myself from falling .
but he steadied me with that terrible , claw , and once more made his insidious gesture .
again the lightning flashed but this time upon a scene not wholly strange .
it was greenwich , the greenwich that used to be , with here and there a roof or row of houses as we see it now , yet with lovely green lanes and fields and bits of grassy common .
the marsh still glittered beyond , but in the farther distance i saw the steeples of what was then all of new york ; trinity and paul and the brick church dominating their sisters , and a faint haze of wood smoke hovering over the whole .
i breathed hard , hut not so much from the sight itself as from the possibilities my imagination terrifiedly conjured up .
can you dare you go far ?
i spoke with awe and i think he shared it for a second , but the evil grin returned .
far ?
what i have seen would blast ye to a mad statue of stone !
back , back forward , forward look , ye puling lackwit !
and as he snarled the phrase under his breath he gestured anew bringing to the sky a flash more blinding than either which had come before .
for full three seconds i could glimpse that pandemoniac sight , and in those seconds i saw a vista which will ever afterward torment me in dreams .
i saw the heavens verminous with strange flying things , and beneath them a hellish black city of giant stone terraces with impious pyramids flung savagely to the moon , and burning from unnumbered windows .
and swarming loathsomely on aerial galleries i saw the yellow , people of that city , robed horribly in orange and red , and dancing insanely to the pounding of fevered , the clatter of obscene crotala , and the maniacal moaning of muted horns whose ceaseless dirges rose and fell undulantly like the wave of an unhallowed ocean of bitumen .
i saw this vista , i say , and heard as with the mind ear the blasphemous domdaniel of cacophony which companioned it .
it was the shrieking fulfilment of all the horror which that had ever stirred in my soul , and forgetting every injunction to silence i screamed and screamed and screamed as my nerves gave way and the walls quivered about me .
then , as the flash subsided , i saw that my host was trembling too ; a look of shocking fear from his face the serpent distortion of rage which my screams had excited .
he tottered , clutched at the curtains as i had done before , and wriggled his head wildly , like a hunted animal .
god knows he had cause , for as the echoes of my screaming died away there came another sound so hellishly suggestive that only numbed emotion kept me sane and conscious .
it was the steady , stealthy creaking of the stairs beyond the locked door , as with the ascent of a barefoot or horde ; and at last the cautious , purposeful rattling of the brass latch that glowed in the feeble candlelight .
the old man clawed and spat at me through the moldy air , and barked things in his throat as he swayed with the yellow curtain he clutched .
the full moon damn ye ye ye yelping dog ye called , and they come for me !
moccasined feet dead men gad sink ye , ye red devils , but i poisoned no rum o ' yours ha i kept your magic safe ye swilled yourselves sick , curse ye , and yet must needs blame the squire let go , you !
unhand that latch i naught for ye here at this point three slow and very deliberate raps shook the panels of the door , and a white foam gathered at the mouth of the frantic magician .
his fright , turning to steely despair , left room for a resurgence of his rage against me ; and he staggered a step toward the table on whose edge i was steadying myself .
the curtains , still clutched in his right hand as his left clawed out at me , grew taut and finally crashed down from their lofty fastenings ; admitting to the room a flood of that full moonlight which the brightening of the sky had presaged .
in those greenish beams the candles paled , and a new semblance of decay spread over the room with its wormy paneling , sagging floor , battered mantel , rickety furniture , and ragged draperies .
it spread over the old man , too , whether from the same source or because of his fear and vehemence , and i saw him shrivel and blacken as he lurched near and strove to rend me with vulturine talons .
only his eyes stayed whole , and they glared with a propulsive , dilated incandescence which grew as the face around them charred and dwindled .
the rapping was now repeated with greater insistence , and this time bore a hint of metal .
the black thing facing me had become only a head with eyes , impotently trying to wriggle across the sinking floor in my direction , and occasionally emitting feeble little spits of immortal malice .
now swift and splintering blows assailed the sickly panels , and i saw the gleam of a tomahawk as it cleft the rending wood .
i did not move , for i could not ; but watched dazedly as the door fell in pieces to admit a colossal , shapeless influx of inky substance starred with shining , malevolent eyes .
it poured thickly , like a flood of oil bursting a rotten bulkhead , overturned a chair as it spread , and finally flowed under the table and across the room to where the blackened head with the eyes still glared at me .
around that head it closed , totally swallowing it up , and in another moment it had begun to recede ; bearing away its invisible burden without touching me , and flowing again out that black doorway and down the unseen stairs , which creaked as before , though in reverse order .
then the floor gave way at last , and i slid gaspingly down into the nighted chamber below , choking with cobwebs and with terror .
the green moon , shining through broken windows , showed me the hall door half open ; and as i rose from the floor and twisted myself free from the sagged ceiling , i saw sweep past it an awful torrent of blackness , with scores of baleful eyes glowing in it .
it was seeking the door to the cellar , and when it found it , vanished therein .
i now felt the floor of this lower room giving as that of the upper chamber had done , and once a crashing above had been followed by the fall past the west window of some thing which must have been the cupola .
now liberated for the instant from the wreckage , i rushed through the hall to the front door and finding myself unable to open it , seized a chair and broke a window , climbing frenziedly out upon the unkempt lawn where moon light danced over grass and weeds .
the wall was high and all the gates were locked but moving a pile of boxes in a corner i managed to gain the top and cling to the great stone urn set there .
about me in my exhaustion i could see only strange walls and windows and old gambrel roofs .
the steep street of my approach was nowhere visible , and the little i did see succumbed rapidly to a mist that rolled in from the river despite the glaring moonlight .
suddenly the urn to which i clung began to tremble , as if sharing my own lethal dizziness ; and in another instant my body was plunging downward to i knew not what fate .
the man who found me said that i must have crawled a long way despite my broken bones , for a trail of blood stretched off as far as he dared look .
the gathering rain soon effaced this link with the scene of my ordeal , and reports could state no more than that i had appeared from a place unknown , at the entrance to a little black court off perry street .
i never sought to return to those tenebrous labyrinths , nor would i direct any sane man thither if i could .
of who or what that ancient creature was , i have no idea ; but i repeat that the city is dead and full of unsuspected horrors .
whither he has gone , i do not know ; but i have gone home to the pure new england lanes up which fragrant sweep at evening .
to be dead , to be truly dead , must be glorious .

.
of herbert west , who was my friend in college and in after life , i can speak only with extreme terror .
this terror is not due altogether to the sinister manner of his recent disappearance , but was engendered by the whole nature of his , and first gained its acute form more than seventeen years ago , when we were in the third year of our course at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham .
while he was with me , the wonder and diabolism of his experiments fascinated me utterly , and i was his closest companion .
now that he is gone and the spell is broken , the actual fear is greater .
memories and possibilities are ever more hideous than realities .
the first horrible incident of our acquaintance was the greatest shock i ever experienced , and it is only with reluctance that i repeat it .
as i have said , it happened when we were in the medical school where west had already made himself notorious through his wild theories on the nature of death and the possibility of overcoming it artificially .
his views , which were widely ridiculed by the faculty and by his , hinged on the essentially mechanistic nature of life ; and concerned means for operating the organic machinery of mankind by calculated chemical action after the failure of natural processes .
in his experiments with various animating solutions , he had killed and treated immense numbers of rabbits , , cats , dogs , and monkeys , till he had become the prime nuisance of the college .
several times he had actually obtained signs of life in animals supposedly dead ; in many cases violent signs but he soon saw that the perfection of his process , if indeed possible , would necessarily involve a lifetime of research .
it likewise became clear that , since the same solution never worked alike on different organic species , he would require human subjects for further and more specialised progress .
it was here that he first came into conflict with the college authorities , and was debarred from future experiments by no less a dignitary than the dean of the medical school himself the learned and benevolent allan halsey , whose work in behalf of the stricken is recalled by every old resident of arkham .
i had always been exceptionally tolerant of west pursuits , and we frequently discussed his theories , whose ramifications and corollaries were almost infinite .
holding with haeckel that all life is a chemical and physical process , and that the soul is a myth , my friend believed that artificial reanimation of the dead can depend only on the condition of the tissues ; and that unless actual decomposition has set in , a corpse fully equipped with organs may with suitable measures be set going again in the peculiar fashion known as life .
that the psychic or intellectual life might be impaired by the slight deterioration of sensitive which even a short period of death would be apt to cause , west fully realised .
it had at first been his hope to find a reagent which would restore vitality before the actual advent of death , and only repeated failures on animals had shewn him that the natural and artificial were incompatible .
he then sought extreme freshness in his specimens , injecting his solutions into the blood immediately after the extinction of life .
it was this circumstance which made the professors so carelessly sceptical , for they felt that true death had not occurred in any case .
they did not stop to view the matter closely and reasoningly .
it was not long after the faculty had interdicted his work that west confided to me his resolution to get fresh human bodies in some manner , and continue in secret the experiments he could no longer perform openly .
to hear him discussing ways and means was rather ghastly , for at the college we had never procured anatomical specimens ourselves .
whenever the morgue proved inadequate , two local negroes attended to this matter , and they were seldom questioned .
west was then a small , slender , spectacled youth with delicate features , yellow hair , pale blue eyes , and a soft voice , and it was uncanny to hear him dwelling on the relative merits of christchurch cemetery and the potter field .
we finally decided on the potter field , because practically every body in christchurch was embalmed ; a thing of course ruinous to west researches .
i was by this time his active and enthralled assistant , and helped him make all his decisions , not only concerning the source of bodies but concerning a suitable place for our loathsome work .
it was i who thought of the deserted chapman farmhouse beyond meadow hill , where we fitted up on the ground floor an operating room and a laboratory , each with dark curtains to conceal our midnight doings .
the place was far from any road , and in sight of no other house , yet precautions were none the less necessary ; since rumours of strange lights , started by chance nocturnal roamers , would soon bring disaster on our enterprise .
it was agreed to call the whole thing a chemical laboratory if discovery should occur .
gradually we equipped our sinister haunt of science with materials either purchased in boston or quietly borrowed from the college materials carefully made unrecognisable save to expert eyes and provided spades and picks for the many burials we should have to make in the cellar .
at the college we used an incinerator , but the apparatus was too costly for our unauthorised laboratory .
bodies were always a nuisance even the small bodies from the slight clandestine experiments in west room at the .
we followed the local like ghouls , for our specimens demanded particular qualities .
what we wanted were corpses interred soon after death and without artificial preservation ; preferably free from malforming disease , and certainly with all organs present .
accident victims were our best hope .
not for many weeks did we hear of anything suitable ; though we talked with morgue and hospital authorities , ostensibly in the college interest , as often as we could without exciting suspicion .
we found that the college had first choice in every case , so that it might be necessary to remain in arkham during the summer , when only the limited classes were held .
in the end , though , luck favoured us ; for one day we heard of an almost ideal case in the potter field ; a brawny young workman drowned only the morning before in summer pond , and buried at the town expense without delay or embalming .
that afternoon we found the new grave , and determined to begin work soon after midnight .
it was a repulsive task that we undertook in the black small hours , even though we lacked at that time the special horror of graveyards which later experiences brought to us .
we carried spades and oil dark lanterns , for although electric torches were then manufactured , they were not as satisfactory as the tungsten contrivances of today .
the process of unearthing was slow and sordid it might have been gruesomely poetical if we had been artists instead of scientists and we were glad when our spades struck wood .
when the pine box was fully uncovered , west scrambled down and removed the lid , dragging out and propping up the contents .
i reached down and hauled the contents out of the grave , and then both toiled hard to restore the spot to its former appearance .
the affair made us rather nervous , especially the stiff form and vacant face of our first trophy , but we managed to remove all traces of our visit .
when we had patted down the last shovelful of earth , we put the specimen in a canvas sack and set out for the old chapman place beyond meadow hill .
on an improvised in the old farmhouse , by the light of a powerful acetylene lamp , the specimen was not very spectral looking .
it had been a sturdy and apparently unimaginative youth of wholesome plebeian type , , and a sound animal without psychological subtleties , and probably having vital processes of the simplest and healthiest sort .
now , with the eyes closed , it looked more asleep than dead ; though the expert test of my friend soon left no doubt on that score .
we had at last what west had always longed for a real dead man of the ideal kind , ready for the solution as prepared according to the most careful calculations and theories for human use .
the tension on our part became very great .
we knew that there was scarcely a chance for anything like complete success , and could not avoid hideous fears at possible grotesque results of partial animation .
especially were we apprehensive concerning the mind and impulses of the creature , since in the space following death some of the more delicate cerebral cells might well have suffered deterioration .
i , myself , still held some curious notions about the traditional soul of man , and felt an awe at the secrets that might be told by one returning from the dead .
i wondered what sights this placid youth might have seen in inaccessible spheres , and what he could relate if fully restored to life .
but my wonder was not overwhelming , since for the most part i shared the materialism of my friend .
he was calmer than i as he forced a large quantity of his fluid into a vein of the body arm , immediately binding the incision securely .
the waiting was gruesome , but west never faltered .
every now and then he applied his stethoscope to the specimen , and bore the negative results philosophically .
after about of an hour without the least sign of life he disappointedly pronounced the solution inadequate , but determined to make the most of his opportunity and try one change in the formula before disposing of his ghastly prize .
we had that afternoon dug a grave in the cellar , and would have to fill it by dawn for although we had fixed a lock on the house , we wished to shun even the remotest risk of a ghoulish discovery .
besides , the body would not be even approximately fresh the next night .
so taking the solitary acetylene lamp into the adjacent laboratory , we left our silent guest on the slab in the dark , and bent every energy to the mixing of a new solution ; the weighing and measuring supervised by west with an almost fanatical care .
the awful event was very sudden , and wholly unexpected .
i was pouring something from one to another , and west was busy over the alcohol which had to answer for a bunsen burner in this gasless edifice , when from the room we had left there burst the most appalling and daemoniac succession of cries that either of us had ever heard .
not more unutterable could have been the chaos of hellish sound if the pit itself had opened to release the agony of the damned , for in one inconceivable cacophony was centered all the supernal terror and unnatural despair of animate nature .
human it could not have been it is not in man to make such sounds and without a thought of our late employment or its possible discovery , both west and i leaped to the nearest window like stricken animals ; overturning tubes , lamp , and retorts , and vaulting madly into the starred abyss of the rural night .
i think we screamed ourselves as we stumbled frantically toward the town , though as we reached the outskirts we put on a semblance of restraint just enough to seem like belated revellers staggering home from a debauch .
we did not separate , but managed to get to west room , where we whispered with the gas up until dawn .
by then we had calmed ourselves a little with rational theories and plans for investigation , so that we could sleep through the day classes being disregarded .
but that evening two items in the paper , wholly unrelated , made it again impossible for us to sleep .
the old deserted chapman house had inexplicably burned to an amorphous heap of ashes ; that we could understand because of the upset lamp .
also , an attempt had been made to disturb a new grave in the potter field , as if by futile and spadeless clawing at the earth .
that we could not understand , for we had patted down the mould very carefully .
and for seventeen years after that west would look frequently over his shoulder , and complain of fancied footsteps behind him .
now he has disappeared .
part the i shall never forget that hideous summer sixteen years ago , when like a noxious afrite from the halls of eblis typhoid stalked leeringly through arkham .
it is by that satanic scourge that most recall the year , for truly terror brooded with over the piles of coffins in the tombs of christchurch cemetery ; yet for me there is a greater horror in that time a horror known to me alone now that herbert west has disappeared .
west and i were doing work in summer classes at the medical school of miskatonic university , and my friend had attained a wide notoriety because of his experiments leading toward the revivification of the dead .
after the scientific slaughter of uncounted small animals the freakish work had ostensibly stopped by order of our sceptical dean , allan halsey ; though west had continued to perform certain secret tests in his dingy room , and had on one terrible and unforgettable occasion taken a human body from its grave in the potter field to a deserted farmhouse beyond meadow hill .
i was with him on that odious occasion , and saw him inject into the still veins the elixir which he thought would to some extent restore life chemical and physical processes .
it had ended horribly in a delirium of fear which we gradually came to attribute to our own overwrought nerves and west had never afterward been able to shake off a maddening sensation of being haunted and hunted .
the body had not been quite fresh enough ; it is obvious that to restore normal mental attributes a body must be very fresh indeed ; and the burning of the old house had prevented us from burying the thing .
it would have been better if we could have known it was underground .
after that experience west had dropped his researches for some time ; but as the zeal of the born scientist slowly returned , he again became importunate with the college faculty , pleading for the use of the and of fresh human specimens for the work he regarded as so overwhelmingly important .
his pleas , however , were wholly in vain ; for the decision of halsey was inflexible , and the other professors all endorsed the verdict of their leader .
in the radical theory of reanimation they saw nothing but the immature vagaries of a youthful enthusiast whose slight form , yellow hair , spectacled blue eyes , and soft voice gave no hint of the supernormal almost diabolical power of the cold brain within .
i can see him now as he was then and i shiver .
he grew sterner of face , but never elderly .
and now sefton asylum has had the mishap and west has vanished .
west clashed disagreeably with halsey near the end of our last undergraduate term in a wordy dispute that did less credit to him than to the kindly dean in point of courtesy .
he felt that he was needlessly and irrationally retarded in a supremely great work ; a work which he could of course conduct to suit himself in later years , but which he wished to begin while still possessed of the exceptional facilities of the university .
that the elders should ignore his singular results on animals , and persist in their denial of the possibility of reanimation , was inexpressibly disgusting and almost incomprehensible to a youth of west logical temperament .
only greater maturity could help him understand the chronic mental limitations of the type the product of generations of pathetic puritanism ; kindly , conscientious , and sometimes gentle and amiable , yet always narrow , intolerant , , and lacking in perspective .
age has more charity for these incomplete yet high souled characters , whose worst real vice is timidity , and who are ultimately punished by general ridicule for their intellectual sins sins like ptolemaism , calvinism , , , and every sort of sabbatarianism and sumptuary legislation .
west , young despite his marvellous scientific acquirements , had scant patience with good halsey and his erudite colleagues ; and nursed an increasing resentment , coupled with a desire to prove his theories to these obtuse worthies in some striking and dramatic fashion .
like most youths , he indulged in elaborate daydreams of revenge , triumph , and final magnanimous forgiveness .
and then had come the scourge , grinning and lethal , from the nightmare caverns of tartarus .
west and i had graduated about the time of its beginning , but had remained for additional work at the summer school , so that we were in arkham when it broke with full daemoniac fury upon the town .
though not as yet licenced physicians , we now had our degrees , and were pressed frantically into public service as the numbers of the stricken grew .
the situation was almost past management , and deaths ensued too frequently for the local undertakers fully to handle .
burials without embalming were made in rapid succession , and even the christchurch cemetery receiving tomb was crammed with coffins of the unembalmed dead .
this circumstance was not without effect on west , who thought often of the irony of the situation so many fresh specimens , yet none for his persecuted researches !
we were frightfully overworked , and the terrific mental and nervous strain made my friend brood morbidly .
but west gentle enemies were no less harassed with prostrating duties .
college had all but closed , and every doctor of the medical faculty was helping to fight the typhoid plague .
halsey in particular had distinguished himself in sacrificing service , applying his extreme skill with energy to cases which many others shunned because of danger or apparent hopelessness .
before a month was over the fearless dean had become a popular hero , though he seemed unconscious of his fame as he struggled to keep from collapsing with physical fatigue and nervous exhaustion .
west could not withhold admiration for the fortitude of his foe , but because of this was even more determined to prove to him the truth of his amazing doctrines .
taking advantage of the disorganisation of both college work and municipal health regulations , he managed to get a recently deceased body smuggled into the university one night , and in my presence injected a new modification of his solution .
the thing actually opened its eyes , but only stared at the ceiling with a look of horror before collapsing into an inertness from which nothing could rouse it .
west said it was not fresh enough the hot summer air does not favour corpses .
that time we were almost caught before we incinerated the thing , and west doubted the advisability of repeating his daring misuse of the college laboratory .
the peak of the epidemic was reached in august .
west and i were almost dead , and halsey did die on the .
the students all attended the hasty funeral on the , and bought an impressive wreath , though the latter was quite overshadowed by the tributes sent by wealthy arkham citizens and by the municipality itself .
it was almost a public affair , for the dean had surely been a public benefactor .
after the entombment we were all somewhat depressed , and spent the afternoon at the bar of the commercial house ; where west , though shaken by the death of his chief opponent , chilled the rest of us with references to his notorious theories .
most of the students went home , or to various duties , as the evening advanced ; but west persuaded me to aid him in making a night of it .
west landlady saw us arrive at his room about two in the morning , with a third man between us ; and told her husband that we had all evidently dined and wined rather well .
apparently this acidulous matron was right ; for about the whole house was aroused by cries coming from west room , where when they broke down the door , they found the two of us unconscious on the carpet , beaten , scratched , and mauled , and with the broken remnants of west bottles and instruments around us .
only an open window told what had become of our assailant , and many wondered how he himself had fared after the terrific leap from the second story to the lawn which he must have made .
there were some strange garments in the room , but west upon regaining consciousness said they did not belong to the stranger , but were specimens collected for bacteriological analysis in the course of investigations on the transmission of germ diseases .
he ordered them burnt as soon as possible in the capacious fireplace .
to the police we both declared ignorance of our late companion identity .
he was , west nervously said , a congenial stranger whom we had met at some downtown bar of uncertain location .
we had all been rather jovial , and west and i did not wish to have our pugnacious companion hunted down .
that same night saw the beginning of the second arkham horror the horror that to me eclipsed the plague itself .
christchurch cemetery was the scene of a terrible killing ; a watchman having been clawed to death in a manner not only too hideous for description , but raising a doubt as to the human agency of the deed .
the victim had been seen alive considerably after midnight the dawn revealed the unutterable thing .
the manager of a circus at the neighbouring town of bolton was questioned , but he swore that no beast had at any time escaped from its cage .
those who found the body noted a trail of blood leading to the receiving tomb , where a small pool of red lay on the concrete just outside the gate .
a fainter trail led away toward the woods , but it soon gave out .
the next night devils danced on the roofs of arkham , and unnatural madness howled in the wind .
through the fevered town had crept a curse which some said was greater than the plague , and which some whispered was the embodied of the plague itself .
eight houses were entered by a nameless thing which strewed red death in its wake in all , seventeen maimed and shapeless remnants of bodies were left behind by the voiceless , sadistic monster that crept abroad .
a few persons had half seen it in the dark , and said it was white and like a malformed ape or anthropomorphic fiend .
it had not left behind quite all that it had attacked , for sometimes it had been hungry .
the number it had killed was fourteen ; three of the bodies had been in stricken homes and had not been alive .
on the third night frantic bands of searchers , led by the police , captured it in a house on crane street near the miskatonic campus .
they had organised the quest with care , keeping in touch by means of volunteer telephone stations , and when someone in the college district had reported hearing a scratching at a shuttered window , the net was quickly spread .
on account of the general alarm and precautions , there were only two more victims , and the capture was effected without major casualties .
the thing was finally stopped by a bullet , though not a fatal one , and was rushed to the local hospital amidst universal excitement and loathing .
for it had been a man .
this much was clear despite the nauseous eyes , the voiceless simianism , and the daemoniac savagery .
they dressed its wound and carted it to the asylum at sefton , where it beat its head against the walls of a padded cell for sixteen years until the recent mishap , when it escaped under circumstances that few like to mention .
what had most disgusted the searchers of arkham was the thing they noticed when the monster face was cleaned the mocking , unbelievable resemblance to a learned and martyr who had been entombed but three days before the late allan halsey , public benefactor and dean of the medical school of miskatonic university .
to the vanished herbert west and to me the disgust and horror were supreme .
i shudder tonight as i think of it ; shudder even more than i did that morning when west muttered through his bandages , damn it , it was quite fresh enough !
part six shots by moonlight published april in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
it is uncommon to fire all six shots of a revolver with great suddenness when one would probably be sufficient , but many things in the life of herbert west were uncommon .
it is , for instance , not often that a young physician leaving college is obliged to conceal the principles which guide his selection of a home and office , yet that was the case with herbert west .
when he and i obtained our degrees at the medical school of miskatonic university , and sought to relieve our poverty by setting up as general practitioners , we took great care not to say that we chose our house because it was fairly well isolated , and as near as possible to the potter field .
reticence such as this is seldom without a cause , nor indeed was ours ; for our requirements were those resulting from a distinctly unpopular .
outwardly we were doctors only , but beneath the surface were aims of far greater and more terrible moment for the essence of herbert west existence was a quest amid black and forbidden realms of the unknown , in which he hoped to uncover the secret of life and restore to perpetual animation the graveyard cold clay .
such a quest demands strange materials , among them fresh human bodies ; and in order to keep supplied with these indispensable things one must live quietly and not far from a place of informal interment .
west and i had met in college , and i had been the only one to sympathise with his hideous experiments .
gradually i had come to be his inseparable assistant , and now that we were out of college we had to keep together .
it was not easy to find a good opening for two doctors in company , but finally the influence of the university secured us a practice in bolton a factory town near arkham , the seat of the college .
the bolton worsted mills are the largest in the miskatonic valley , and their polyglot employees are never popular as patients with the local physicians .
we chose our house with the greatest care , seizing at last on a rather cottage near the end of pond street ; five numbers from the closest neighbour , and separated from the local potter field by only a stretch of meadow land , bisected by a narrow neck of the rather dense forest which lies to the north .
the distance was greater than we wished , but we could get no nearer house without going on the other side of the field , wholly out of the factory district .
we were not much displeased , however , since there were no people between us and our sinister source of supplies .
the walk was a trifle long , but we could haul our silent specimens undisturbed .
our practice was surprisingly large from the very first large enough to please most young doctors , and large enough to prove a bore and a burden to students whose real interest lay elsewhere .
the were of somewhat turbulent inclinations ; and besides their many natural needs , their frequent clashes and stabbing affrays gave us plenty to do .
but what actually absorbed our minds was the secret laboratory we had fitted up in the cellar the laboratory with the long table under the electric lights , where in the small hours of the morning we often injected west various solutions into the veins of the things we dragged from the potter field .
west was experimenting madly to find something which would start man vital motions anew after they had been stopped by the thing we call death , but had encountered the most ghastly obstacles .
the solution had to be differently compounded for different types what would serve for would not serve for human beings , and different human specimens required large modifications .
the bodies had to be exceedingly fresh , or the slight decomposition of brain tissue would render perfect reanimation impossible .
indeed , the greatest problem was to get them fresh enough west had had horrible experiences during his secret college researches with corpses of doubtful vintage .
the results of partial or imperfect animation were much more hideous than were the total failures , and we both held fearsome recollections of such things .
ever since our first daemoniac session in the deserted farmhouse on meadow hill in arkham , we had felt a brooding menace ; and west , though a calm , blond , scientific automaton in most respects , often confessed to a shuddering sensation of stealthy pursuit .
he half felt that he was followed a psychological delusion of shaken nerves , enhanced by the undeniably disturbing fact that at least one of our reanimated specimens was still alive a frightful carnivorous thing in a padded cell at sefton .
then there was another our first whose exact fate we had never learned .
we had fair luck with specimens in bolton much better than in arkham .
we had not been settled a week before we got an accident victim on the very night of burial , and made it open its eyes with an amazingly rational expression before the solution failed .
it had lost an arm if it had been a perfect body we might have succeeded better .
between then and the next january we secured three more ; one total failure , one case of marked muscular motion , and one rather shivery thing it rose of itself and uttered a sound .
then came a period when luck was poor ; interments fell off , and those that did occur were of specimens either too diseased or too maimed for use .
we kept track of all the deaths and their circumstances with systematic care .
one march night , however , we unexpectedly obtained a specimen which did not come from the potter field .
in bolton the prevailing spirit of puritanism had outlawed the sport of boxing with the usual result .
surreptitious and bouts among the were common , and occasionally professional talent of low grade was imported .
this late winter night there had been such a match ; evidently with disastrous results , since two timorous poles had come to us with incoherently whispered entreaties to attend to a very secret and desperate case .
we followed them to an abandoned barn , where the remnants of a crowd of frightened foreigners were watching a silent black form on the floor .
the match had been between kid a lubberly and now quaking youth with a most hooked nose and buck robinson , the harlem smoke .
the negro had been knocked out , and a moment examination shewed us that he would permanently remain so .
he was a loathsome , thing , with abnormally long arms which i could not help calling fore legs , and a face that conjured up thoughts of unspeakable congo secrets and poundings under an eerie moon .
the body must have looked even worse in life but the world holds many ugly things .
fear was upon the whole pitiful crowd , for they did not know what the law would exact of them if the affair were not hushed up ; and they were grateful when west , in spite of my involuntary shudders , offered to get rid of the thing quietly for a purpose i knew too well .
there was bright moonlight over the snowless landscape , but we dressed the thing and carried it home between us through the deserted streets and meadows , as we had carried a similar thing one horrible night in arkham .
we approached the house from the field in the rear , took the specimen in the back door and down the cellar stairs , and prepared it for the usual experiment .
our fear of the police was absurdly great , though we had timed our trip to avoid the solitary patrolman of that section .
the result was wearily anticlimactic .
ghastly as our prize appeared , it was wholly unresponsive to every solution we injected in its black arm ; solutions prepared from experience with white specimens only .
so as the hour grew dangerously near to dawn , we did as we had done with the others dragged the thing across the meadows to the neck of the woods near the potter field , and buried it there in the best sort of grave the frozen ground would furnish .
the grave was not very deep , but fully as good as that of the previous specimen the thing which had risen of itself and uttered a sound .
in the light of our dark lanterns we carefully covered it with leaves and dead vines , fairly certain that the police would never find it in a forest so dim and dense .
the next day i was increasingly apprehensive about the police , for a patient brought rumours of a suspected fight and death .
west had still another source of worry , for he had been called in the afternoon to a case which ended very threateningly .
an italian woman had become hysterical over her missing child a lad of five who had strayed off early in the morning and failed to appear for dinner and had developed symptoms highly alarming in view of an always weak heart .
it was a very foolish hysteria , for the boy had often run away before ; but italian peasants are exceedingly superstitious , and this woman seemed as much harassed by omens as by facts .
about seven in the evening she had died , and her frantic husband had made a frightful scene in his efforts to kill west , whom he wildly blamed for not saving her life .
friends had held him when he drew a stiletto , but west departed amidst his inhuman shrieks , curses and oaths of vengeance .
in his latest affliction the fellow seemed to have forgotten his child , who was still missing as the night advanced .
there was some talk of searching the woods , but most of the family friends were busy with the dead woman and the screaming man .
altogether , the nervous strain upon west must have been tremendous .
thoughts of the police and of the mad italian both weighed heavily .
we retired about eleven , but i did not sleep well .
bolton had a surprisingly good police force for so small a town , and i could not help fearing the mess which would ensue if the affair of the night before were ever tracked down .
it might mean the end of all our local work and perhaps prison for both west and me .
i did not like those rumours of a fight which were floating about .
after the clock had struck three the moon shone in my eyes , but i turned over without rising to pull down the shade .
then came the steady rattling at the back door .
i lay still and somewhat dazed , but before long heard west rap on my door .
he was clad in and slippers , and had in his hands a revolver and an electric flashlight .
from the revolver i knew that he was thinking more of the crazed italian than of the police .
we better both go , he whispered .
it would do not to answer it anyway , and it may be a patient it would be like one of those fools to try the back door .
so we both went down the stairs on tiptoe , with a fear partly justified and partly that which comes only from the soul of the weird small hours .
the rattling continued , growing somewhat louder .
when we reached the door i cautiously unbolted it and threw it open , and as the moon streamed revealingly down on the form silhouetted there , west did a peculiar thing .
despite the obvious danger of attracting notice and bringing down on our heads the dreaded police investigation a thing which after all was mercifully averted by the relative isolation of our cottage my friend suddenly , excitedly , and unnecessarily emptied all six chambers of his revolver into the nocturnal visitor .
for that visitor was neither italian nor policeman .
looming hideously against the spectral moon was a gigantic misshapen thing not to be imagined save in nightmares a , apparition nearly on all fours , covered with bits of mould , leaves , and vines , foul with caked blood , and having between its glistening teeth a snow white , terrible , cylindrical object terminating in a tiny hand .
part the scream of the dead published may in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
the scream of a dead man gave to me that acute and added horror of herbert west which harassed the latter years of our companionship .
it is natural that such a thing as a dead man scream should give horror , for it is obviously , not a pleasing or ordinary occurrence ; but i was used to similar experiences , hence suffered on this occasion only because of a particular circumstance .
and , as i have implied , it was not of the dead man himself that i became afraid .
herbert west , whose associate and assistant i was , possessed scientific interests far beyond the usual routine of a village physician .
that was why , when establishing his practice in bolton , he had chosen an isolated house near the potter field .
briefly and brutally stated , west sole absorbing interest was a secret study of the phenomena of life and its cessation , leading toward the reanimation of the dead through injections of an excitant solution .
for this ghastly experimenting it was necessary to have a constant supply of very fresh human bodies ; very fresh because even the least decay hopelessly damaged the brain structure , and human because we found that the solution had to be compounded differently for different types of organisms .
scores of rabbits and had been killed and treated , but their trail was a blind one .
west had never fully succeeded because he had never been able to secure a corpse sufficiently fresh .
what he wanted were bodies from which vitality had only just departed ; bodies with every cell intact and capable of receiving again the impulse toward that mode of motion called life .
there was hope that this second and artificial life might be made perpetual by repetitions of the injection , but we had learned that an ordinary natural life would not respond to the action .
to establish the artificial motion , natural life must be extinct the specimens must be very fresh , but genuinely dead .
the awesome quest had begun when west and i were students at the miskatonic university medical school in arkham , vividly conscious for the first time of the thoroughly mechanical nature of life .
that was seven years before , but west looked scarcely a day older now he was small , blond , , , and spectacled , with only an occasional flash of a cold blue eye to tell of the hardening and growing fanaticism of his character under the pressure of his terrible investigations .
our experiences had often been hideous in the extreme ; the results of defective reanimation , when lumps of graveyard clay had been galvanised into morbid , unnatural , and brainless motion by various modifications of the vital solution .
one thing had uttered a scream ; another had risen violently , beaten us both to unconsciousness , and run amuck in a shocking way before it could be placed behind asylum bars ; still another , a loathsome african monstrosity , had clawed out of its shallow grave and done a deed west had had to shoot that object .
we could not get bodies fresh enough to shew any trace of reason when reanimated , so had perforce created nameless horrors .
it was disturbing to think that one , perhaps two , of our monsters still lived that thought haunted us shadowingly , till finally west disappeared under frightful circumstances .
but at the time of the scream in the cellar laboratory of the isolated bolton cottage , our fears were subordinate to our anxiety for extremely fresh specimens .
west was more avid than i , so that it almost seemed to me that he looked at any very healthy living physique .
it was in july , , that the bad luck regarding specimens began to turn .
i had been on a long visit to my parents in illinois , and upon my return found west in a state of singular elation .
he had , he told me excitedly , in all likelihood solved the problem of freshness through an approach from an entirely new angle that of artificial preservation .
i had known that he was working on a new and highly unusual embalming compound , and was not surprised that it had turned out well ; but until he explained the details i was rather puzzled as to how such a compound could help in our work , since the objectionable staleness of the specimens was largely due to delay occurring before we secured them .
this , i now saw , west had clearly recognised ; creating his embalming compound for future rather than immediate use , and trusting to fate to supply again some very recent and unburied corpse , as it had years before when we obtained the negro killed in the bolton .
at last fate had been kind , so that on this occasion there lay in the secret cellar laboratory a corpse whose decay could not by any possibility have begun .
what would happen on reanimation , and whether we could hope for a revival of mind and reason , west did not venture to predict .
the experiment would be a landmark in our studies , and he had saved the new body for my return , so that both might share the spectacle in accustomed fashion .
west told me how he had obtained the specimen .
it had been a vigorous man ; a stranger just off the train on his way to transact some business with the bolton worsted mills .
the walk through the town had been long , and by the time the traveller paused at our cottage to ask the way to the factories , his heart had become greatly overtaxed .
he had refused a stimulant , and had suddenly dropped dead only a moment later .
the body , as might be expected , seemed to west a heaven sent gift .
in his brief conversation the stranger had made it clear that he was unknown in bolton , and a search of his pockets subsequently revealed him to be one robert leavitt of louis , apparently without a family to make instant inquiries about his disappearance .
if this man could not be restored to life , no one would know of our experiment .
we buried our materials in a dense strip of woods between the house and the potter field .
if , on the other hand , he could be restored , our fame would be brilliantly and perpetually established .
so without delay west had injected into the body wrist the compound which would hold it fresh for use after my arrival .
the matter of the presumably weak heart , which to my mind imperilled the success of our experiment , did not appear to trouble west extensively .
he hoped at last to obtain what he had never obtained before a rekindled spark of reason and perhaps a normal , living creature .
so on the night of july , , herbert west and i stood in the cellar laboratory and gazed at a white , silent figure beneath the dazzling .
the embalming compound had worked uncannily well , for as i stared fascinatedly at the sturdy frame which had lain two weeks without stiffening , i was moved to seek west assurance that the thing was really dead .
this assurance he gave readily enough ; reminding me that the reanimating solution was never used without careful tests as to life , since it could have no effect if any of the original vitality were present .
as west proceeded to take preliminary steps , i was impressed by the vast intricacy of the new experiment ; an intricacy so vast that he could trust no hand less delicate than his own .
forbidding me to touch the body , he first injected a drug in the wrist just beside the place his needle had punctured when injecting the embalming compound .
this , he said , was to neutralise the compound and release the system to a normal relaxation so that the reanimating solution might freely work when injected .
slightly later , when a change and a gentle tremor seemed to affect the dead limbs ; west stuffed a object violently over the twitching face , not withdrawing it until the corpse appeared quiet and ready for our attempt at reanimation .
the pale enthusiast now applied some last perfunctory tests for absolute lifelessness , withdrew satisfied , and finally injected into the left arm an accurately measured amount of the vital elixir , prepared during the afternoon with a greater care than we had used since college days , when our feats were new and groping .
i can not express the wild , breathless suspense with which we waited for results on this first really fresh specimen the first we could reasonably expect to open its lips in rational speech , perhaps to tell of what it had seen beyond the unfathomable abyss .
west was a materialist , believing in no soul and attributing all the working of consciousness to bodily phenomena ; consequently he looked for no revelation of hideous secrets from gulfs and caverns beyond death barrier .
i did not wholly disagree with him theoretically , yet held vague instinctive remnants of the primitive faith of my forefathers ; so that i could not help eyeing the corpse with a certain amount of awe and terrible expectation .
besides i could not extract from my memory that hideous , inhuman shriek we heard on the night we tried our first experiment in the deserted farmhouse at arkham .
very little time had elapsed before i saw the attempt was not to be a total failure .
a touch of colour came to cheeks hitherto , and spread out under the curiously ample stubble of sandy beard .
west , who had his hand on the pulse of the left wrist , suddenly nodded significantly ; and almost simultaneously a mist appeared on the mirror inclined above the body mouth .
there followed a few spasmodic muscular motions , and then an audible breathing and visible motion of the chest .
i looked at the closed eyelids , and thought i detected a quivering .
then the lids opened , shewing eyes which were grey , calm , and alive , but still unintelligent and not even curious .
in a moment of fantastic whim i whispered questions to the reddening ears ; questions of other worlds of which the memory might still be present .
subsequent terror drove them from my mind , but i think the last one , which i repeated , was where have you been ?
i do not yet know whether i was answered or not , for no sound came from the well shaped mouth ; but i do know that at that moment i firmly thought the thin lips moved silently , forming syllables which i would have vocalised as only now if that phrase had possessed any sense or relevancy .
at that moment , as i say , i was elated with the conviction that the one great goal had been attained ; and that for the first time a reanimated corpse had uttered distinct words impelled by actual reason .
in the next moment there was no doubt about the triumph ; no doubt that the solution had truly accomplished , at least temporarily , its full mission of restoring rational and articulate life to the dead .
but in that triumph there came to me the greatest of all horrors not horror of the thing that spoke , but of the deed that i had witnessed and of the man with whom my professional fortunes were joined .
for that very fresh body , at last writhing into full and terrifying consciousness with eyes dilated at the memory of its last scene on earth , threw out its frantic hands in a life and death struggle with the air , and suddenly collapsing into a second and final dissolution from which there could be no return , screamed out the cry that will ring eternally in my aching brain help !
keep off , you cursed little fiend keep that damned needle away from me !
part v the horror from the shadows published june in home brew vol .
, no .
, .
many men have related hideous things , not mentioned in print , which happened on the battlefields of the great war .
some of these things have made me faint , others have convulsed me with devastating nausea , while still others have made me tremble and look behind me in the dark ; yet despite the worst of them i believe i can myself relate the most hideous thing of all the shocking , the unnatural , the unbelievable horror from the shadows .
in i was a physician with the rank of first lieutenant in a canadian regiment in flanders , one of many americans to precede the government itself into the gigantic struggle .
i had not entered the army on my own initiative , but rather as a natural result of the enlistment of the man whose indispensable assistant i was the celebrated boston surgical specialist , herbert west .
west had been avid for a chance to serve as surgeon in a great war , and when the chance had come , he carried me with him almost against my will .
there were reasons why i could have been glad to let the war separate us ; reasons why i found the practice of medicine and the companionship of west more and more irritating ; but when he had gone to ottawa and through a colleague influence secured a medical commission as major , i could not resist the imperious persuasion of one determined that i should accompany him in my usual capacity .
when i say that west was avid to serve in battle , i do not mean to imply that he was either naturally warlike or anxious for the safety of civilisation .
always an intellectual machine ; slight , blond , , and spectacled ; i think he secretly sneered at my occasional martial enthusiasms and censures of supine neutrality .
there was , however , something he wanted in embattled flanders ; and in order to secure it had had to assume a military exterior .
what he wanted was not a thing which many persons want , but something connected with the peculiar branch of medical science which he had chosen quite clandestinely to follow , and in which he had achieved amazing and occasionally hideous results .
it was , in fact , nothing more or less than an abundant supply of freshly killed men in every stage of dismemberment .
herbert west needed fresh bodies because his was the reanimation of the dead .
this work was not known to the fashionable clientele who had so swiftly built up his fame after his arrival in boston ; but was only too well known to me , who had been his closest friend and sole assistant since the old days in miskatonic university medical school at arkham .
it was in those college days that he had begun his terrible experiments , first on small animals and then on human bodies shockingly obtained .
there was a solution which he injected into the veins of dead things , and if they were fresh enough they responded in strange ways .
he had had much trouble in discovering the proper formula , for each type of organism was found to need a stimulus especially adapted to it .
terror stalked him when he reflected on his partial failures ; nameless things resulting from imperfect solutions or from bodies insufficiently fresh .
a certain number of these failures had remained alive one was in an asylum while others had vanished and as he thought of conceivable yet virtually impossible eventualities he often shivered beneath his usual stolidity .
west had soon learned that absolute freshness was the prime requisite for useful specimens , and had accordingly resorted to frightful and unnatural expedients in .
in college , and during our early practice together in the factory town of bolton , my attitude toward him had been largely one of fascinated admiration ; but as his boldness in methods grew , i began to develop a gnawing fear .
i did not like the way he looked at healthy living bodies ; and then there came a nightmarish session in the cellar laboratory when i learned that a certain specimen had been a living body when he secured it .
that was the first time he had ever been able to revive the quality of rational thought in a corpse ; and his success , obtained at such a loathsome cost , had completely hardened him .
of his methods in the intervening five years i dare not speak .
i was held to him by sheer force of fear , and witnessed sights that no human tongue could repeat .
gradually i came to find herbert west himself more horrible than anything he did that was when it dawned on me that his once normal scientific zeal for prolonging life had subtly degenerated into a mere morbid and ghoulish curiosity and secret sense of charnel picturesqueness .
his interest became a hellish and perverse addiction to the repellently and fiendishly abnormal ; he gloated calmly over artificial monstrosities which would make most healthy men drop dead from fright and disgust ; he became , behind his pallid intellectuality , a fastidious baudelaire of physical experiment a languid elagabalus of the tombs .
dangers he met unflinchingly ; crimes he committed unmoved .
i think the climax came when he had proved his point that rational life can be restored , and had sought new worlds to conquer by experimenting on the reanimation of detached parts of bodies .
he had wild and original ideas on the independent vital properties of organic cells and separated from natural physiological systems ; and achieved some hideous preliminary results in the form of , artificially nourished tissue obtained from the nearly hatched eggs of an indescribable tropical reptile .
two biological points he was exceedingly anxious to settle first , whether any amount of consciousness and rational action be possible without the brain , proceeding from the spinal cord and various ; and second , whether any kind of ethereal , intangible relation distinct from the material cells may exist to link the surgically separated parts of what has previously been a single living organism .
all this research work required a prodigious supply of freshly slaughtered human flesh and that was why herbert west had entered the great war .
the phantasmal , unmentionable thing occurred one midnight late in march , , in a field hospital behind the lines of eloi .
i wonder even now if it could have been other than a daemoniac dream of delirium .
west had a private laboratory in an east room of the temporary edifice , assigned him on his plea that he was devising new and radical methods for the treatment of hitherto hopeless cases of maiming .
there he worked like a butcher in the midst of his gory wares i could never get used to the levity with which he handled and classified certain things .
at times he actually did perform marvels of surgery for the soldiers ; but his chief delights were of a less public and philanthropic kind , requiring many explanations of sounds which seemed peculiar even amidst that babel of the damned .
among these sounds were frequent surely not uncommon on a battlefield , but distinctly uncommon in an hospital .
west reanimated specimens were not meant for long existence or a large audience .
besides human tissue , west employed much of the reptile embryo tissue which he had cultivated with such singular results .
it was better than human material for maintaining life in organless fragments , and that was now my friend chief activity .
in a dark corner of the laboratory , over a queer incubating burner , he kept a large covered vat full of this reptilian ; which multiplied and grew puffily and hideously .
on the night of which i speak we had a splendid new specimen a man at once physically powerful and of such high mentality that a sensitive nervous system was assured .
it was rather ironic , for he was the officer who had helped west to his commission , and who was now to have been our associate .
moreover , he had in the past secretly studied the theory of reanimation to some extent under west .
major sir eric moreland , , was the greatest surgeon in our division , and had been hastily assigned to the eloi sector when news of the heavy fighting reached headquarters .
he had come in an aeroplane piloted by the intrepid lieut .
ronald hill , only to be shot down when directly over his destination .
the fall had been spectacular and awful ; hill was unrecognisable afterward , but the wreck yielded up the great surgeon in a nearly decapitated but otherwise intact condition .
west had greedily seized the lifeless thing which had once been his friend and ; and i shuddered when he finished severing the head , placed it in his hellish vat of pulpy reptile tissue to preserve it for future experiments , and proceeded to treat the decapitated body on the operating table .
he injected new blood , joined certain veins , arteries , and nerves at the headless neck , and closed the ghastly aperture with engrafted skin from an unidentified specimen which had borne an officer uniform .
i knew what he wanted to see if this highly organised body could exhibit , without its head , any of the signs of mental life which had distinguished sir eric moreland .
once a student of reanimation , this silent trunk was now gruesomely called upon to exemplify it .
i can still see herbert west under the sinister electric light as he injected his reanimating solution into the arm of the headless body .
the scene i can not describe i should faint if i tried it , for there is madness in a room full of classified charnel things , with blood and lesser human debris almost on the slimy floor , and with hideous reptilian abnormalities sprouting , bubbling , and baking over a winking spectre of dim flame in a far corner of black shadows .
the specimen , as west repeatedly observed , had a splendid nervous system .
much was expected of it ; and as a few twitching motions began to appear , i could see the feverish interest on west face .
he was ready , i think , to see proof of his increasingly strong opinion that consciousness , reason , and personality can exist independently of the brain that man has no central connective spirit , but is merely a machine of nervous matter , each section more or less complete in itself .
in one triumphant demonstration west was about to relegate the mystery of life to the category of myth .
the body now twitched more vigorously , and beneath our avid eyes commenced to heave in a frightful way .
the arms stirred disquietingly , the legs drew up , and various muscles contracted in a repulsive kind of writhing .
then the headless thing threw out its arms in a gesture which was unmistakably one of desperation an intelligent desperation apparently sufficient to prove every theory of herbert west .
certainly , the nerves were recalling the man last act in life ; the struggle to get free of the falling aeroplane .
what followed , i shall never positively know .
it may have been wholly an hallucination from the shock caused at that instant by the sudden and complete destruction of the building in a cataclysm of german who can gainsay it , since west and i were the only proved survivors ?
west liked to think that before his recent disappearance , but there were times when he could not ; for it was queer that we both had the same hallucination .
the hideous occurrence itself was very simple , notable only for what it implied .
the body on the table had risen with a blind and terrible groping , and we had heard a sound .
i should not call that sound a voice , for it was too awful .
and yet its timbre was not the most awful thing about it .
neither was its message it had merely screamed , jump , ronald , for god sake , jump !
the awful thing was its source .
for it had come from the large covered vat in that ghoulish corner of crawling black shadows .
part the published july in home brew vol .
, no .
, when herbert west disappeared a year ago , the boston police questioned me closely .
they suspected that i was holding something back , and perhaps suspected graver things ; but i could not tell them the truth because they would not have believed it .
they knew , indeed , that west had been connected with activities beyond the credence of ordinary men ; for his hideous experiments in the reanimation of dead bodies had long been too extensive to admit of perfect secrecy ; but the final catastrophe held elements of daemoniac phantasy which make even me doubt the reality of what i saw .
i was west closest friend and only confidential assistant .
we had met years before , in medical school , and from the first i had shared his terrible researches .
he had slowly tried to perfect a solution which , injected into the veins of the newly deceased , would restore life ; a labour demanding an abundance of fresh corpses and therefore involving the most unnatural actions .
still more shocking were the products of some of the experiments grisly masses of flesh that had been dead , but that west waked to a blind , brainless , nauseous animation .
these were the usual results , for in order to reawaken the mind it was necessary to have specimens so absolutely fresh that no decay could possibly affect the delicate .
this need for very fresh corpses had been west moral undoing .
they were hard to get , and one awful day he had secured his specimen while it was still alive and vigorous .
a struggle , a needle , and a powerful alkaloid had transformed it to a very fresh corpse , and the experiment had succeeded for a brief and memorable moment ; but west had emerged with a soul calloused and seared , and a hardened eye which sometimes glanced with a kind of hideous and calculating appraisal at men of especially sensitive brain and especially vigorous physique .
toward the last i became acutely afraid of west , for he began to look at me that way .
people did not seem to notice his glances , but they noticed my fear ; and after his disappearance used that as a basis for some absurd suspicions .
west , in reality , was more afraid than i ; for his abominable pursuits entailed a life of furtiveness and dread of every shadow .
partly it was the police he feared ; but sometimes his nervousness was deeper and more nebulous , touching on certain indescribable things into which he had injected a morbid life , and from which he had not seen that life depart .
he usually finished his experiments with a revolver , but a few times he had not been quick enough .
there was that first specimen on whose rifled grave marks of clawing were later seen .
there was also that arkham professor body which had done cannibal things before it had been captured and thrust unidentified into a madhouse cell at sefton , where it beat the walls for sixteen years .
most of the other possibly surviving results were things less easy to speak of for in later years west scientific zeal had degenerated to an unhealthy and fantastic mania , and he had spent his chief skill in vitalising not entire human bodies but isolated parts of bodies , or parts joined to organic matter other than human .
it had become fiendishly disgusting by the time he disappeared ; many of the experiments could not even be hinted at in print .
the great war , through which both of us served as surgeons , had intensified this side of west .
in saying that west fear of his specimens was nebulous , i have in mind particularly its complex nature .
part of it came merely from knowing of the existence of such nameless monsters , while another part arose from apprehension of the bodily harm they might under certain circumstances do him .
their disappearance added horror to the situation of them all , west knew the whereabouts of only one , the pitiful asylum thing .
then there was a more subtle fear a very fantastic sensation resulting from a curious experiment in the canadian army in .
west , in the midst of a severe battle , had reanimated major sir eric moreland , , a who knew about his experiments and could have duplicated them .
the head had been removed , so that the possibilities of life in the trunk might be investigated .
just as the building was wiped out by a german shell , there had been a success .
the trunk had moved intelligently ; and , unbelievable to relate , we were both sickeningly sure that articulate sounds had come from the detached head as it lay in a shadowy corner of the laboratory .
the shell had been merciful , in a way but west could never feel as certain as he wished , that we two were the only survivors .
he used to make shuddering conjectures about the possible actions of a headless physician with the power of reanimating the dead .
west last quarters were in a venerable house of much elegance , overlooking one of the oldest in boston .
he had chosen the place for purely symbolic and fantastically aesthetic reasons , since most of the interments were of the colonial period and therefore of little use to a scientist seeking very fresh bodies .
the laboratory was in a secretly constructed by imported workmen , and contained a huge incinerator for the quiet and complete disposal of such bodies , or fragments and synthetic mockeries of bodies , as might remain from the morbid experiments and unhallowed amusements of the owner .
during the excavation of this cellar the workmen had struck some exceedingly ancient masonry ; undoubtedly connected with the old , yet far too deep to correspond with any known sepulchre therein .
after a number of calculations west decided that it represented some secret chamber beneath the tomb of the averills , where the last interment had been made in .
i was with him when he studied the nitrous , dripping walls laid bare by the spades and mattocks of the men , and was prepared for the gruesome thrill which would attend the uncovering of centuried ; but for the first time west new timidity conquered his natural curiosity , and he betrayed his degenerating fibre by ordering the masonry left intact and plastered over .
thus it remained till that final hellish night ; part of the walls of the secret laboratory .
i speak of west decadence , but must add that it was a purely mental and intangible thing .
outwardly he was the same to the last calm , cold , slight , and , with spectacled blue eyes and a general aspect of youth which years and fears seemed never to change .
he seemed calm even when he thought of that clawed grave and looked over his shoulder ; even when he thought of the carnivorous thing that gnawed and pawed at sefton bars .
the end of herbert west began one evening in our joint study when he was dividing his curious glance between the newspaper and me .
a strange headline item had struck at him from the crumpled pages , and a nameless titan claw had seemed to reach down through sixteen years .
something fearsome and incredible had happened at sefton asylum fifty miles away , stunning the neighbourhood and baffling the police .
in the small hours of the morning a body of silent men had entered the grounds , and their leader had aroused the attendants .
he was a menacing military figure who talked without moving his lips and whose voice seemed almost ventriloquially connected with an immense black case he carried .
his expressionless face was handsome to the point of radiant beauty , but had shocked the superintendent when the hall light fell on it for it was a wax face with eyes of painted glass .
some nameless accident had befallen this man .
a larger man guided his steps ; a repellent hulk whose bluish face seemed half eaten away by some unknown malady .
the speaker had asked for the custody of the cannibal monster committed from arkham sixteen years before ; and upon being refused , gave a signal which precipitated a shocking riot .
the fiends had beaten , trampled , and bitten every attendant who did not flee ; killing four and finally succeeding in the liberation of the monster .
those victims who could recall the event without hysteria swore that the creatures had acted less like men than like unthinkable automata guided by the leader .
by the time help could be summoned , every trace of the men and of their mad charge had vanished .
from the hour of reading this item until midnight , west sat almost paralysed .
at midnight the doorbell rang , startling him fearfully .
all the servants were asleep in the attic , so i answered the bell .
as i have told the police , there was no wagon in the street , but only a group of figures bearing a large square box which they deposited in the hallway after one of them had grunted in a highly unnatural voice , express prepaid .
they filed out of the house with a jerky tread , and as i watched them go i had an odd idea that they were turning toward the ancient cemetery on which the back of the house abutted .
when i slammed the door after them west came downstairs and looked at the box .
it was about two feet square , and bore west correct name and present address .
it also bore the inscription , from eric moreland , eloi , flanders .
six years before , in flanders , a shelled hospital had fallen upon the headless reanimated trunk of , and upon the detached head which perhaps had uttered articulate sounds .
west was not even excited now .
his condition was more ghastly .
quickly he said , it the finish but let incinerate this .
we carried the thing down to the laboratory listening .
i do not remember many particulars you can imagine my state of mind but it is a vicious lie to say it was herbert west body which i put into the incinerator .
we both inserted the whole unopened wooden box , closed the door , and started the electricity .
nor did any sound come from the box , after all .
it was west who first noticed the falling plaster on that part of the wall where the ancient tomb masonry had been covered up .
i was going to run , but he stopped me .
then i saw a small black aperture , felt a ghoulish wind of ice , and smelled the charnel bowels of a putrescent earth .
there was no sound , but just then the electric lights went out and i saw outlined against some phosphorescence of the nether world a horde of silent toiling things which only insanity or worse could create .
their outlines were human , , fractionally human , and not human at all the horde was grotesquely heterogeneous .
they were removing the stones quietly , one by one , from the centuried wall .
and then , as the breach became large enough , they came out into the laboratory in single file ; led by a talking thing with a beautiful head made of wax .
a sort of monstrosity behind the leader seized on herbert west .
west did not resist or utter a sound .
then they all sprang at him and tore him to pieces before my eyes , bearing the fragments away into that subterranean vault of fabulous abominations .
west head was carried off by the leader , who wore a canadian officer uniform .
as it disappeared i saw that the blue eyes behind the spectacles were hideously blazing with their first touch of frantic , visible emotion .
servants found me unconscious in the morning .
west was gone .
the incinerator contained only unidentifiable ashes .
detectives have questioned me , but what can i say ?
the sefton tragedy they will not connect with west ; not that , nor the men with the box , whose existence they deny .
i told them of the vault , and they pointed to the unbroken plaster wall and laughed .
so i told them no more .
they imply that i am either a madman or a murderer probably i am mad .
but i might not be mad if those accursed had not been so silent .
may the merciful gods , if indeed there be such , guard those hours when no power of the will , or drug that the cunning of man devises , can keep me from the chasm of sleep .
death is merciful , for there is no return therefrom , but with him who has come back out of the nethermost chambers of night , haggard and knowing , peace rests nevermore .
fool that i was to plunge with such unsanctioned frensy into mysteries no man was meant to penetrate ; fool or god that he was my only friend , who led me and went before me , and who in the end passed into terrors which may yet be mine !
we met , i recall , in a railway station , where he was the center of a crowd of the vulgarly curious .
he was unconscious , having fallen in a kind of convulsion which imparted to his slight body a strange rigidity .
i think he was then approaching forty years of age , for there were deep lines in the face , wan and , but oval and actually beautiful ; and touches of gray in the thick , waving hair and small full beard which had once been of the deepest raven black .
his brow was white as the marble of pentelicus , and of a height and breadth almost .
i said to myself , with all the ardor of a sculptor , that this man was a faun statue out of antique hellas , dug from a temple ruins and brought somehow to life in our stifling age only to feel the chill and pressure of devastating years .
and when he opened his immense , sunken , and wildly luminous black eyes i knew he would be thenceforth my only friend the only friend of one who had never possessed a friend before for i saw that such eyes must have looked fully upon the grandeur and the terror of realms beyond normal consciousness and reality ; realms which i had cherished in fancy , but vainly sought .
so as i drove the crowd away i told him he must come home with me and be my teacher and leader in unfathomed mysteries , and he assented without speaking a word .
afterward i found that his voice was music the music of deep viols and of crystalline spheres .
we talked often in the night , and in the day , when i chiseled busts of him and carved miniature heads in ivory to immortalize his different expressions .
of our studies it is impossible to speak , since they held so slight a connection with anything of the world as living men conceive it .
they were of that vaster and more appalling universe of dim entity and consciousness which lies deeper than matter , time , and space , and whose existence we suspect only in certain forms of rare dreams beyond dreams which come never to common men , and but once or twice in the lifetime of imaginative men .
the cosmos of our waking knowledge , born from such an universe as a bubble is born from the pipe of a jester , touches it only as such a bubble may touch its sardonic source when sucked back by the jester whim .
men of learning suspect it little and ignore it mostly .
wise men have interpreted dreams , and the gods have laughed .
one man with oriental eyes has said that all time and space are relative , and men have laughed .
but even that man with oriental eyes has done no more than suspect .
i had wished and tried to do more than suspect , and my friend had tried and partly succeeded .
then we both tried together , and with exotic drugs courted terrible and forbidden dreams in the tower studio chamber of the old in hoary kent .
among the agonies of these after days is that chief of inarticulateness .
what i learned and saw in those hours of impious exploration can never be told for want of symbols or suggestions in any language .
i say this because from first to last our discoveries partook only of the nature of sensations ; sensations correlated with no impression which the nervous system of normal humanity is capable of receiving .
they were sensations , yet within them lay unbelievable elements of time and space things which at bottom possess no distinct and definite existence .
human utterance can best convey the general character of our experiences by calling them plungings or soarings ; for in every period of revelation some part of our minds broke boldly away from all that is real and present , rushing aerially along shocking , unlighted , and abysses , and occasionally tearing through certain and typical obstacles describable only as viscous , uncouth clouds of vapors .
in these black and bodiless flights we were sometimes alone and sometimes together .
when we were together , my friend was always far ahead ; i could comprehend his presence despite the absence of form by a species of pictorial memory whereby his face appeared to me , golden from a strange light and frightful with its weird beauty , its anomalously youthful cheeks , its burning eyes , its olympian brow , and its shadowing hair and growth of beard .
of the progress of time we kept no record , for time had become to us the merest illusion .
i know only that there must have been something very singular involved , since we came at length to marvel why we did not grow old .
our discourse was unholy , and always hideously ambitious no god or demon could have aspired to discoveries and conquest like those which we planned in whispers .
i shiver as i speak of them , and dare not be explicit ; though i will say that my friend once wrote on paper a wish which he dared not utter with his tongue , and which made me burn the paper and look affrightedly out of the window at the spangled night sky .
i will hint only hint that he had designs which involved the rulership of the visible universe and more ; designs whereby the earth and the stars would move at his command , and the destinies of all living things be his .
i affirm i swear that i had no share in these extreme aspirations .
anything my friend may have said or written to the contrary must be erroneous , for i am no man of strength to risk the unmentionable spheres by which alone one might achieve success .
there was a night when winds from unknown spaces whirled us irresistibly into limitless vacuum beyond all thought and entity .
perceptions of the most maddeningly untransmissible sort thronged upon us ; perceptions of infinity which at the time convulsed us with joy , yet which are now partly lost to my memory and partly incapable of presentation to others .
viscous obstacles were clawed through in rapid succession , and at length i felt that we had been borne to realms of greater remoteness than any we had previously known .
my friend was vastly in advance as we plunged into this awesome ocean of virgin aether , and i could see the sinister exultation on his floating , luminous , .
suddenly that face became dim and quickly disappeared , and in a brief space i found myself projected against an obstacle which i could not penetrate .
it was like the others , yet incalculably denser ; a sticky clammy mass , if such terms can be applied to analogous qualities in a sphere .
i had , i felt , been halted by a barrier which my friend and leader had successfully passed .
struggling anew , i came to the end of the drug dream and opened my physical eyes to the tower studio in whose opposite corner reclined the pallid and still unconscious form of my fellow dreamer , weirdly haggard and wildly beautiful as the moon shed light on his marble features .
then , after a short interval , the form in the corner stirred ; and may pitying heaven keep from my sight and sound another thing like that which took place before me .
i can not tell you how he shrieked , or what vistas of unvisitable hells gleamed for a second in black eyes crazed with fright .
i can only say that i fainted , and did not stir till he himself recovered and shook me in his frensy for someone to keep away the horror and desolation .
that was the end of our voluntary searchings in the caverns of dream .
awed , shaken , and portentous , my friend who had been beyond the barrier warned me that we must never venture within those realms again .
what he had seen , he dared not tell me ; but he said from his wisdom that we must sleep as little as possible , even if drugs were necessary to keep us awake .
that he was right , i soon learned from the unutterable fear which engulfed me whenever consciousness lapsed .
after each short and inevitable sleep i seemed older , whilst my friend aged with a rapidity almost shocking .
it is hideous to see wrinkles form and hair whiten almost before one eyes .
our mode of life was now totally altered .
heretofore a recluse so far as i true name and origin never having passed his lips my friend now became frantic in his fear of solitude .
at night he would not be alone , nor would the company of a few persons calm him .
his sole relief was obtained in revelry of the most general and boisterous sort ; so that few assemblies of the young and gay were unknown to us .
our appearance and age seemed to excite in most cases a ridicule which i keenly resented , but which my friend considered a lesser evil than solitude .
especially was he afraid to be out of doors alone when the stars were shining , and if forced to this condition he would often glance furtively at the sky as if hunted by some monstrous thing therein .
he did not always glance at the same place in the seemed to be a different place at different times .
on spring evenings it would be low in the northeast .
in the summer it would be nearly overhead .
in the autumn it would be in the northwest .
in winter it would be in the east , but mostly if in the small hours of morning .
midwinter evenings seemed least dreadful to him .
only after two years did i connect this fear with anything in particular ; but then i began to see that he must be looking at a special spot on the celestial vault whose position at different times corresponded to the direction of his glance a spot roughly marked by the constellation corona borealis .
we now had a studio in london , never separating , but never discussing the days when we had sought to plumb the mysteries of the unreal world .
we were aged and weak from our drugs , dissipations , and nervous overstrain , and the thinning hair and beard of my friend had become .
our freedom from long sleep was surprising , for seldom did we succumb more than an hour or two at a time to the shadow which had now grown so frightful a menace .
then came one january of fog and rain , when money ran low and drugs were hard to buy .
my statues and ivory heads were all sold , and i had no means to purchase new materials , or energy to fashion them even had i possessed them .
we suffered terribly , and on a certain night my friend sank into a sleep from which i could not awaken him .
i can recall the scene now the desolate , garret studio under the eaves with the rain beating down ; the ticking of our lone clock ; the fancied ticking of our watches as they rested on the ; the creaking of some swaying shutter in a remote part of the house ; certain distant city noises muffled by fog and space ; and , worst of all , the deep , steady , sinister breathing of my friend on the couch a rhythmical breathing which seemed to measure moments of supernal fear and agony for his spirit as it wandered in spheres forbidden , unimagined , and hideously remote .
the tension of my vigil became oppressive , and a wild train of trivial impressions and associations thronged through my almost unhinged mind .
i heard a clock strike somewhere not ours , for that was not a striking clock and my morbid fancy found in this a new for idle wanderings .
clocks time space then my fancy reverted to the locale as i reflected that even now , beyond the roof and the fog and the rain and the atmosphere , corona borealis was rising in the northeast .
corona borealis , which my friend had appeared to dread , and whose scintillant semicircle of stars must even now be glowing unseen through the measureless abysses of aether .
all at once my feverishly sensitive ears seemed to detect a new and wholly distinct component in the soft medley of sounds a low and damnably insistent whine from very far away ; droning , clamoring , mocking , calling , from the northeast .
but it was not that distant whine which robbed me of my faculties and set upon my soul such a seal of fright as may never in life be removed ; not that which drew the shrieks and excited the convulsions which caused lodgers and police to break down the door .
it was not what i heard , but what i saw ; for in that dark , locked , shuttered , and curtained room there appeared from the black northeast corner a shaft of horrible light a shaft which bore with it no glow to disperse the darkness , but which streamed only upon the recumbent head of the troubled sleeper , bringing out in hideous duplication the luminous and strangely youthful as i had known it in dreams of abysmal space and unshackled time , when my friend had pushed behind the barrier to those secret , innermost and forbidden caverns of nightmare .
and as i looked , i beheld the head rise , the black , liquid , and deep sunken eyes open in terror , and the thin , shadowed lips part as if for a scream too frightful to be uttered .
there dwelt in that ghastly and flexible face , as it shone bodiless , luminous , and rejuvenated in the blackness , more of stark , teeming , fear than all the rest of heaven and earth has ever revealed to me .
no word was spoken amidst the distant sound that grew nearer and nearer , but as i followed the mad stare along that cursed shaft of light to its source , the source whence also the whining came , i , too , saw for an instant what it saw , and fell with ringing ears in that fit of shrieking epilepsy which brought the lodgers and the police .
never could i tell , try as i might , what it actually was that i saw ; nor could the still face tell , for although it must have seen more than i did , it will never speak again .
but always i shall guard against the mocking and insatiate hypnos , lord of sleep , against the night sky , and against the mad ambitions of knowledge and philosophy .
just what happened is unknown , for not only was my own mind unseated by the strange and hideous thing , but others were tainted with a forgetfulness which can mean nothing if not madness .
they have said , i know not for what reason , that i never had a friend ; but that art , philosophy , and insanity had filled all my tragic life .
the lodgers and police on that night soothed me , and the doctor administered something to quiet me , nor did anyone see what a nightmare event had taken place .
my stricken friend moved them to no pity , but what they found on the couch in the studio made them give me a praise which sickened me , and now a fame which i spurn in despair as i sit for hours , bald , , shriveled , palsied , , and broken , adoring and praying to the object they found .
for they deny that i sold the last of my statuary , and point with ecstasy at the thing which the shining shaft of light left cold , petrified , and unvocal .
it is all that remains of my friend ; the friend who led me on to madness and wreckage ; a godlike head of such marble as only old hellas could yield , young with the youth that is outside time , and with beauteous bearded face , curved , smiling lips , olympian brow , and dense locks waving and .
they say that that haunting is modeled from my own , as it was at twenty five ; but upon the marble base is carven a single name in the letters of attica .
mystery attracts mystery .
ever since the wide appearance of my name as a performer of unexplained feats , i have encountered strange narratives and events which my calling has led people to link with my interests and activities .
some of these have been trivial and irrelevant , some deeply dramatic and absorbing , some productive of weird and perilous experiences and some involving me in extensive scientific and historical research .
many of these matters i have told and shall continue to tell very freely ; but there is one of which i speak with great reluctance , and which i am now relating only after a session of grilling persuasion from the publishers of this magazine , who had heard vague rumors of it from other members of my family .
the hitherto guarded subject pertains to my visit to egypt fourteen years ago , and has been avoided by me for several reasons .
for one thing , i am averse to exploiting certain unmistakably actual facts and conditions obviously unknown to the myriad tourists who throng about the pyramids and apparently secreted with much diligence by the authorities at cairo , who can not be wholly ignorant of them .
for another thing , i dislike to recount an incident in which my own fantastic imagination must have played so great a part .
what i saw or thought i saw certainly did not take place ; but is rather to be viewed as a result of my then recent readings in egyptology , and of the speculations anent this theme which my environment naturally prompted .
these imaginative stimuli , magnified by the excitement of an actual event terrible enough in itself , undoubtedly gave rise to the culminating horror of that grotesque night so long past .
in january , , i had finished a professional engagement in england and signed a contract for a tour of australian theatres .
a liberal time being allowed for the trip , i determined to make the most of it in the sort of travel which chiefly interests me ; so accompanied by my wife i drifted pleasantly down the continent and embarked at marseilles on the p amp ; o steamer malwa , bound for port said .
from that point i proposed to visit the principal historical localities of lower egypt before leaving finally for australia .
the voyage was an agreeable one , and enlivened by many of the amusing incidents which befall a magical performer apart from his work .
i had intended , for the sake of quiet travel , to keep my name a secret ; but was goaded into betraying myself by a whose anxiety to astound the passengers with ordinary tricks tempted me to duplicate and exceed his feats in a manner quite destructive of my incognito .
i mention this because of its ultimate effect an effect i should have foreseen before unmasking to a shipload of tourists about to scatter throughout the nile valley .
what it did was to herald my identity wherever i subsequently went , and deprive my wife and me of all the placid inconspicuousness we had sought .
traveling to seek curiosities , i was often forced to stand inspection as a sort of curiosity myself !
we had come to egypt in search of the picturesque and the mystically impressive , but found little enough when the ship edged up to port said and discharged its passengers in small boats .
low dunes of sand , bobbing buoys in shallow water , and a drearily european small town with nothing of interest save the great de lesseps statue , made us anxious to get to something more worth our while .
after some discussion we decided to proceed at once to cairo and the pyramids , later going to alexandria for the australian boat and for whatever sights that ancient metropolis might present .
the railway journey was tolerable enough , and consumed only four hours and a half .
we saw much of the suez canal , whose route we followed as far as ismailiya and later had a taste of old egypt in our glimpse of the restored canal of the middle empire .
then at last we saw cairo glimmering through the growing dusk ; a winkling constellation which became a blaze as we halted at the great gare centrale .
but once more disappointment awaited us , for all that we beheld was european save the costumes and the crowds .
a prosaic subway led to a square teeming with carriages , taxicabs , and and gorgeous with electric lights shining on tall buildings ; whilst the very theatre where i was vainly requested to play and which i later attended as a spectator , had recently been renamed the cosmograph ' .
we stopped at shepheard hotel , reached in a taxi that sped along broad , smartly streets ; and amidst the perfect service of its restaurant , elevators and generally luxuries the mysterious east and immemorial past seemed very far away .
the next day , however , precipitated us delightfully into the heart of the arabian nights atmosphere ; and in the winding ways and exotic skyline of cairo , the bagdad of seemed to live again .
guided by our baedeker , we had struck east past the ezbekiyeh gardens along the mouski in quest of the native quarter , and were soon in the hands of a clamorous cicerone who notwithstanding later developments was assuredly a master at his trade .
not until afterward did i see that i should have applied at the hotel for a licensed guide .
this man , a shaven , peculiarly and relatively cleanly fellow who looked like a pharaoh and called himself reis el drogman ' appeared to have much power over others of his kind ; though subsequently the police professed not to know him , and to suggest that reis is merely a name for any person in authority , whilst ' is obviously no more than a clumsy modification of the word for a leader of tourist parties dragoman .
abdul led us among such wonders as we had before only read and dreamed of .
old cairo is itself a and a dream labyrinths of narrow alleys redolent of aromatic secrets ; arabesque balconies and oriels nearly meeting above the cobbled streets ; maelstroms of oriental traffic with strange cries , cracking whips , rattling carts , jingling money , and braying donkeys ; kaleidoscopes of polychrome robes , veils , turbans , and tarbushes ; and dervishes , dogs and cats , soothsayers and barbers ; and over all the whining of blind beggars crouched in alcoves , and the sonorous chanting of muezzins from minarets limned delicately against a sky of deep , unchanging blue .
the roofed , quieter bazaars were hardly less alluring .
spice , perfume , incense beads , rugs , silks , and brass old mahmoud suleiman squats amidst his gummy bottles while chattering youths pulverize mustard in the capital of an ancient classic column a roman corinthian , perhaps from neighboring heliopolis , where augustus stationed one of his three egyptian legions .
antiquity begins to mingle with exoticism .
and then the mosques and the museum we saw them all , and tried not to let our arabian revel succumb to the darker charm of pharaonic egypt which the museum priceless treasures offered .
that was to be our climax , and for the present we concentrated on the mediaeval saracenic glories of the califs whose magnificent form a glittering faery necropolis on the edge of the arabian desert .
at length abdul took us along the sharia mohammed ali to the ancient mosque of sultan hassan , and the , beyond which climbs the pass to the mighty citadel that saladin himself built with the stones of forgotten pyramids .
it was sunset when we scaled that cliff , circled the modern mosque of mohammed ali , and looked down from the dizzy parapet over mystic cairo mystic cairo all golden with its carven domes , its ethereal minarets and its flaming gardens .
far over the city towered the great roman dome of the new museum ; and beyond it across the cryptic yellow nile that is the mother of eons and dynasties lurked the menacing sands of the libyan desert , undulant and iridescent and evil with older arcana .
the red sun sank low , bringing the relentless chill of egyptian dusk ; and as it stood poised on the world rim like that ancient god of heliopolis , the we saw silhouetted against its vermeil holocaust the black outlines of the pyramids of gizeh the palaeogean tombs there were hoary with a thousand years when amen mounted his golden throne in distant thebes .
then we knew that we were done with saracen cairo , and that we must taste the deeper mysteries of primal egypt the black kem of re and amen , isis and osiris .
the next morning we visited the pyramids , riding out in a victoria across the island of chizereh with its massive lebbakh trees , and the smaller english bridge to the western shore .
down the shore road we drove , between great rows of lebbakhs and past the vast zoological gardens to the suburb of gizeh , where a new bridge to cairo proper has since been built .
then , turning inland along the , we crossed a region of glassy canals and shabby native villages till before us loomed the objects of our quest , cleaving the mists of dawn and forming inverted replicas in the roadside pools .
forty centuries , as napoleon had told his campaigners there , indeed looked down upon us .
the road now rose abruptly , till we finally reached our place of transfer between the trolley station and the mena house hotel .
abdul reis , who capably purchased our pyramid tickets , seemed to have an understanding with the crowding , yelling and offensive bedouins who inhabited a squalid mud village some distance away and pestiferously assailed every traveler ; for he kept them very decently at bay and secured an excellent pair of camels for us , himself mounting a donkey and assigning the leadership of our animals to a group of men and boys more expensive than useful .
the area to be traversed was so small that camels were hardly needed , but we did not regret adding to our experience this troublesome form of desert navigation .
the pyramids stand on a high rock plateau , this group forming next to the northernmost of the series of regal and aristocratic cemeteries built in the neighborhood of the extinct capital memphis , which lay on the same side of the nile , somewhat south of gizeh , and which flourished between and .
the greatest pyramid , which lies nearest the modern road , was built by king cheops or khufu about , and stands more than feet in perpendicular height .
in a line southwest from this are successively the second pyramid , built a generation later by king khephren , and though slightly smaller , looking even larger because set on higher ground , and the radically smaller third pyramid of king mycerinus , built about .
near the edge of the plateau and due east of the second pyramid , with a face probably altered to form a colossal portrait of khephren , its royal restorer , stands the monstrous sphinx mute , sardonic , and wise beyond mankind and memory .
minor pyramids and the traces of ruined minor pyramids are found in several places , and the whole plateau is pitted with the tombs of dignitaries of less than royal rank .
these latter were originally marked by mastabas , or stone structures about the deep burial shafts , as found in other memphian cemeteries and exemplified by perneb tomb in the metropolitan museum of new york .
at gizeh , however , all such visible things have been swept away by time and pillage ; and only the shafts , either or cleared out by archaeologists , remain to attest their former existence .
connected with each tomb was a chapel in which priests and relatives offered food and prayer to the hovering ka or vital principle of the deceased .
the small tombs have their chapels contained in their stone mastabas or superstructures , but the mortuary chapels of the pyramids , where regal pharaohs lay , were separate temples , each to the east of its corresponding pyramid , and connected by a causeway to a massive or propylon at the edge of the rock plateau .
the leading to the second pyramid , nearly buried in the drifting sands , yawns subterraneously of the sphinx .
persistent tradition dubs it the of the sphinx ' ; and it may perhaps be rightly called such if the sphinx indeed represents the second pyramid builder khephren .
there are unpleasant tales of the sphinx before khephren but whatever its elder features were , the monarch replaced them with his own that men might look at the colossus without fear .
it was in the great that the diorite statue of khephren now in the cairo museum was found ; a statue before which i stood in awe when i beheld it .
whether the whole edifice is now excavated i am not certain , but in most of it was below ground , with the entrance heavily barred at night .
germans were in charge of the work , and the war or other things may have stopped them .
i would give much , in view of my experience and of certain bedouin whisperings discredited or unknown in cairo , to know what has developed in connection with a certain well in a transverse gallery where statues of the pharaoh were found in curious juxtaposition to the statues of baboons .
the road , as we traversed it on our camels that morning , curved sharply past the wooden police quarters , post office , drug store and shops on the left , and plunged south and east in a complete bend that scaled the rock plateau and brought us face to face with the desert under the lee of the great pyramid .
past cyclopean masonry we rode , rounding the eastern face and looking down ahead into a valley of minor pyramids beyond which the eternal nile glistened to the east , and the eternal desert shimmered to the west .
very close loomed the three major pyramids , the greatest devoid of outer casing and showing its bulk of great stones , but the others retaining here and there the neatly fitted covering which had made them smooth and finished in their day .
presently we descended toward the sphinx , and sat silent beneath the spell of those terrible unseeing eyes .
on the vast stone breast we faintly discerned the emblem of , for whose image the sphinx was mistaken in a late dynasty ; and though sand covered the tablet between the great paws , we recalled what thutmosis inscribed thereon , and the dream he had when a prince .
it was then that the smile of the sphinx vaguely displeased us , and made us wonder about the legends of subterranean passages beneath the monstrous creature , leading down , down , to depths none might dare hint at depths connected with mysteries older than the dynastic egypt we excavate , and having a sinister relation to the persistence of abnormal , animal headed gods in the ancient nilotic pantheon .
then , too , it was i asked myself in idle question whose hideous significance was not to appear for many an hour .
other tourists now began to overtake us , and we moved on to the sand choked temple of the sphinx , fifty yards to the southeast , which i have previously mentioned as the great gate of the causeway to the second pyramid mortuary chapel on the plateau .
most of it was still underground , and although we dismounted and descended through a modern passageway to its alabaster corridor and pillared hall , i felt that abdul and the local german attendant had not shown us all there was to see .
after this we made the conventional circuit of the pyramid plateau , examining the second pyramid and the peculiar ruins of its mortuary chapel to the east , the third pyramid and its miniature southern satellites and ruined eastern chapel , the rock tombs and the honeycombings of the fourth and fifth dynasties , and the famous campbell tomb whose shadowy shaft sinks precipitously for feet to a sinister sarcophagus which one of our camel drivers divested of the cumbering sand after a vertiginous descent by rope .
cries now assailed us from the great pyramid , where bedouins were besieging a party of tourists with offers of speed in the performance of solitary trips up and down .
seven minutes is said to be the record for such an ascent and descent , but many lusty sheiks and sons of sheiks assured us they could cut it to five if given the requisite impetus of liberal baksheesh .
they did not get this impetus , though we did let abdul take us up , thus obtaining a view of unprecedented magnificence which included not only remote and glittering cairo with its crowned citadel background of hills , but all the pyramids of the memphian district as well , from abu roash on the north to the dashur on the south .
the sakkara , which marks the evolution of the low mastaba into the true pyramid , showed clearly and alluringly in the sandy distance .
it is close to this transition monument that the famed tomb of perneb was found more than four hundred miles north of the theban rock valley where sleeps .
again i was forced to silence through sheer awe .
the prospect of such antiquity , and the secrets each hoary monument seemed to hold and brood over , filled me with a reverence and sense of immensity nothing else ever gave me .
fatigued by our climb , and disgusted with the importunate bedouins whose actions seemed to defy every rule of taste , we omitted the arduous detail of entering the cramped interior passages of any of the pyramids , though we saw several of the hardiest tourists preparing for the suffocating crawl through cheops ' mightiest memorial .
as we dismissed and overpaid our local bodyguard and drove back to cairo with abdul reis under the afternoon sun , we half regretted the omission we had made .
such fascinating things were whispered about lower pyramid passages not in the guidebooks ; passages whose entrances had been hastily blocked up and concealed by certain uncommunicative archaeologists who had found and begun to explore them .
of course , this whispering was largely baseless on the face of it ; but it was curious to reflect how persistently visitors were forbidden to enter the pyramids at night , or to visit the lowest burrows and crypt of the great pyramid .
perhaps in the latter case it was the psychological effect which was feared the effect on the visitor of feeling himself huddled down beneath a gigantic world of solid masonry ; joined to the life he has known by the merest tube , in which he may only crawl , and which any accident or evil design might block .
the whole subject seemed so weird and alluring that we resolved to pay the pyramid plateau another visit at the earliest possible opportunity .
for me this opportunity came much earlier than i expected .
that evening , the members of our party feeling some what tired after the strenuous program of the day , i went alone with abdul reis for a walk through the picturesque arab quarter .
though i had seen it by day , i wished to study the alleys and bazaars in the dusk , when rich shadows and mellow gleams of light would add to their glamor and fantastic illusion .
the native crowds were thinning , but were still very noisy and numerous when we came upon a knot of reveling bedouins in the , or bazaar of the coppersmiths .
their apparent leader , an insolent youth with heavy features and saucily cocked tarbush , took some notice of us , and evidently recognized with no great friendliness my competent but admittedly supercilious and sneeringly disposed guide .
perhaps , i thought , he resented that odd reproduction of the sphinx which i had often remarked with amused irritation ; or perhaps he did not like the hollow and sepulchral resonance of abdul voice .
at any rate , the exchange of ancestrally opprobrious language became very brisk ; and before long ali ziz , as i heard the stranger called when called by no worse name , began to pull violently at abdul robe , an action quickly reciprocated and leading to a spirited scuffle in which both combatants lost their sacredly cherished headgear and would have reached an even direr condition had i not intervened and separated them by main force .
my interference , at first seemingly unwelcome on both sides , succeeded at last in effecting a truce .
sullenly each belligerent composed his wrath and his attire , and with an assumption of dignity as profound as it was sudden , the two formed a curious pact of honor which i soon learned is a custom of great antiquity in cairo a pact for the settlement of their difference by means of a nocturnal fist fight atop the great pyramid , long after the departure of the last moonlight sightseer .
each duelist was to assemble a party of seconds , and the affair was to begin at midnight , proceeding by rounds in the most civilized possible fashion .
in all this planning there was much which excited my interest .
the fight itself promised to be unique and spectacular , while the thought of the scene on that hoary pile overlooking the antediluvian plateau of gizeh under the wan moon of the pallid small hours appealed to every fiber of imagination in me .
a request found abdul exceedingly willing to admit me to his party of seconds ; so that all the rest of the early evening i accompanied him to various dens in the most lawless regions of the town mostly northeast of the ezbekiyeh where he gathered one by one a select and formidable band of congenial cutthroats as his pugilistic background .
shortly after nine our party , mounted on donkeys bearing such royal or names as , ' twain , ' ' j .
morgan , ' and , ' edged through street labyrinths both oriental and occidental , crossed the muddy and nile by the bridge of the bronze lions , and cantered philosophically between the lebbakhs on the road to gizeh .
slightly over two hours were consumed by the trip , toward the end of which we passed the last of the returning tourists , saluted the last inbound , and were alone with the night and the past and the spectral moon .
then we saw the vast pyramids at the end of the avenue , ghoulish with a dim atavistical menace which i had not seemed to notice in the daytime .
even the smallest of them held a hint of the ghastly for was it not in this that they had buried queen nitocris alive in the sixth dynasty ; subtle queen nitocris , who once invited all her enemies to a feast in a temple below the nile , and drowned them by opening the ?
i recalled that the arabs whisper things about nitocris , and shun the third pyramid at certain phases of the moon .
it must have been over her that thomas moore was brooding when he wrote a thing muttered about by memphian boatmen subterranean nymph that dwells sunless gems and glories hid the lady of the pyramid ! '
early as we were , ali ziz and his party were ahead of us ; for we saw their donkeys outlined against the desert plateau at ; toward which squalid arab settlement , close to the sphinx , we had diverged instead of following the regular road to the mena house , where some of the sleepy , inefficient police might have observed and halted us .
here , where filthy bedouins stabled camels and donkeys in the rock tombs of khephren courtiers , we were led up the rocks and over the sand to the great pyramid , up whose sides the arabs swarmed eagerly , abdul reis offering me the assistance i did not need .
as most travelers know , the actual apex of this structure has long been worn away , leaving a reasonably flat platform twelve yards square .
on this eery pinnacle a squared circle was formed , and in a few moments the sardonic desert moon leered down upon a battle which , but for the quality of the ringside cries , might well have occurred at some minor athletic club in america .
as i watched it , i felt that some of our institutions were not lacking ; for every blow , feint , and defense bespoke ' to my not inexperienced eye .
it was quickly over , and despite my misgivings as to methods i felt a sort of proprietary pride when abdul reis was adjudged the winner .
reconciliation was phenomenally rapid , and amidst the singing , fraternizing and drinking that followed , i found it difficult to realize that a quarrel had ever occurred .
oddly enough , i myself seemed to be more a center of notice than the antagonists ; and from my smattering of arabic i judged that they were discussing my professional performances and escapes from every sort of manacle and confinement , in a manner which indicated not only a surprising knowledge of me , but a distinct hostility and skepticism concerning my feats of escape .
it gradually dawned on me that the elder magic of egypt did not depart without leaving traces , and that fragments of a strange secret lore and priestly have survived surreptitiously amongst the fellaheen to such an extent that the prowess of a strange hahwi or magician is resented and disputed .
i thought of how much my guide abdul reis looked like an old egyptian priest or pharaoh or smiling sphinx and wondered .
suddenly something happened which in a flash proved the correctness of my reflections and made me curse the denseness whereby i had accepted this night events as other than the empty and malicious ' they now showed themselves to be .
without warning , and doubtless in answer to some subtle sign from abdul , the entire band of bedouins precipitated itself upon me ; and having produced heavy ropes , soon had me bound as securely as i was ever bound in the course of my life , either on the stage or off .
i struggled at first , but soon saw that one man could make no headway against a band of over twenty sinewy barbarians .
my hands were tied behind my back , my knees bent to their fullest extent , and my wrists and ankles stoutly linked together with unyielding cords .
a stifling gag was forced into my mouth , and a blindfold fastened tightly over my eyes .
then , as arabs bore me aloft on their shoulders and began a jouncing descent of the pyramid , i heard the taunts of my late guide abdul , who mocked and jeered delightedly in his hollow voice , and assured me that i was soon to have my ' put to a supreme test which would quickly remove any egotism i might have gained through triumphing over all the tests offered by america and europe .
egypt , he reminded me , is very old , and full of inner mysteries and antique powers not even conceivable to the experts of today , whose devices had so uniformly failed to entrap me .
how far or in what direction i was carried , i can not tell ; for the circumstances were all against the formation of any accurate judgment .
i know , however , that it could not have been a great distance ; since my bearers at no point hastened beyond a walk , yet kept me aloft a surprisingly short time .
it is this perplexing brevity which makes me feel almost like shuddering whenever i think of gizeh and its plateau for one is oppressed by hints of the closeness to everyday tourist routes of what existed then and must exist still .
the evil abnormality i speak of did not become manifest at first .
setting me down on a surface which i recognized as sand rather than rock , my captors passed a rope around my chest and dragged me a few feet to a ragged opening in the ground , into which they presently lowered me with much rough handling .
for apparent eons i bumped against the stony irregular sides of a narrow hewn well which i took to be one of the numerous of the plateau until the prodigious , almost incredible depth of it robbed me of all bases of conjecture .
the horror of the experience deepened with every dragging second .
that any descent through the sheer solid rock could be so vast without reaching the core of the planet itself , or that any rope made by man could be so long as to dangle me in these unholy and seemingly fathomless profundities of nether earth , were beliefs of such grotesqueness that it was easier to doubt my agitated senses than to accept them .
even now i am uncertain , for i know how deceitful the sense of time becomes when one is removed or distorted .
but i am quite sure that i preserved a logical consciousness that far ; that at least i did not add any fullgrown phantoms of imagination to a picture hideous enough in its reality , and explicable by a type of cerebral illusion vastly short of actual hallucination .
all this was not the cause of my first bit of fainting .
the shocking ordeal was cumulative , and the beginning of the later terrors was a very perceptible increase in my rate of descent .
they were paying out that infinitely long rope very swiftly now , and i scraped cruelly against the rough and constricted sides of the shaft as i shot madly downward .
my clothing was in tatters , and i felt the trickle of blood all over , even above the mounting and excruciating pain .
my nostrils , too , were assailed by a scarcely definable menace a creeping odor of damp and staleness curiously unlike anything i had ever smelled before , and having faint overtones of spice and incense that lent an element of mockery .
then the mental cataclysm came .
it was horrible hideous beyond all articulate description because it was all of the soul , with nothing of detail to describe .
it was the ecstasy of nightmare and the summation of the fiendish .
the suddenness of it was apocalyptic and demoniac one moment i was plunging agonizingly down that narrow well of torture , yet the next moment i was soaring on bat wings in the gulfs of hell ; swinging free and swooping through illimitable miles of boundless , musty space ; rising dizzily to measureless pinnacles of chilling ether , then diving gaspingly to sucking nadirs of ravenous , nauseous lower vacua thank god for the mercy that shut out in oblivion those clawing furies of consciousness which half unhinged my faculties , and tore at my spirit !
that one respite , short as it was , gave me the strength and sanity to endure those still greater sublimations of cosmic panic that lurked and gibbered on the road ahead .
it was very gradually that i regained my senses after that eldritch flight through stygian space .
the process was infinitely painful , and colored by fantastic dreams in which my bound and gagged condition found singular embodiment .
the precise nature of these dreams was very clear while i was experiencing them , but became blurred in my recollection almost immediately afterward , and was soon reduced to the merest outline by the terrible events real or imaginary which followed .
i dreamed that i was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw ; a yellow , hairy , paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulf me .
and when i stopped to reflect what the paw was , it seemed to me that it was egypt .
in the dream i looked back at the events of the preceding weeks , and saw myself lured and enmeshed little by little , subtly and insidiously , by some hellish of the elder nile sorcery ; some spirit that was in egypt before ever man was , and that will be when man is no more .
i saw the horror and unwholesome antiquity of egypt , and the grisly alliance it has always had with the tombs and temples of the dead .
i saw phantom processions of priests with the heads of bulls , falcons , cats , and ibises ; phantom processions marching interminably through subterraneous labyrinths and avenues of titanic propylaea beside which a man is as a fly , and offering unnamable sacrifice to indescribable gods .
stone colossi marched in endless night and drove herds of grinning androsphinxes down to the shores of illimitable stagnant rivers of pitch .
and behind it all i saw the ineffable malignity of primordial necromancy , black and amorphous , and fumbling greedily after me in the darkness to choke out the spirit that had dared to mock it by emulation .
in my sleeping brain there took shape a melodrama of sinister hatred and pursuit , and i saw the black soul of egypt singling me out and calling me in inaudible whispers ; calling and luring me , leading me on with the glitter and glamor of a saracenic surface , but ever pulling me down to the catacombs and horrors of its dead and abysmal pharaonic heart .
then the dream faces took on human resemblances , and i saw my guide abdul reis in the robes of a king , with the sneer of the sphinx on his features .
and i knew that those features were the features of khephren the great , who raised the second pyramid , carved over the sphinx face in the likeness of his own and built that titanic gateway temple whose myriad corridors the archaeologists think they have dug out of the cryptical sand and the uninformative rock .
and i looked at the long , lean rigid hand of khephren ; the long , lean , rigid hand as i had seen it on the diorite statue in the cairo museum the statue they had found in the terrible gateway temple and wondered that i had not shrieked when i saw it on abdul reis that hand !
it was hideously cold , and it was crushing me ; it was the cold and cramping of the sarcophagus the chill and constriction of unrememberable egypt it was nighted , necropolitan egypt itself , that yellow paw and they whisper such things of khephren
but at this juncture i began to wake or at least , to assume a condition less completely that of sleep than the one just preceding .
i recalled the fight atop the pyramid , the treacherous bedouins and their attack , my frightful descent by rope through endless rock depths , and my mad swinging and plunging in a chill void redolent of aromatic putrescence .
i perceived that i now lay on a damp rock floor , and that my bonds were still biting into me with unloosened force .
it was very cold , and i seemed to detect a faint current of noisome air sweeping across me .
the cuts and bruises i had received from the jagged sides of the rock shaft were paining me woefully , their soreness enhanced to a stinging or burning acuteness by some pungent quality in the faint draft , and the mere act of rolling over was enough to set my whole frame throbbing with untold agony .
as i turned i felt a tug from above , and concluded that the rope whereby i was lowered still reached to the surface .
whether or not the arabs still held it , i had no idea ; nor had i any idea how far within the earth i was .
i knew that the darkness around me was wholly or nearly total , since no ray of moonlight penetrated my blindfold ; but i did not trust my senses enough to accept as evidence of extreme depth the sensation of vast duration which had characterized my descent .
knowing at least that i was in a space of considerable extent reached from the above surface directly by an opening in the rock , i doubtfully conjectured that my prison was perhaps the buried gateway chapel of old khephren the temple of the sphinx perhaps some inner corridors which the guides had not shown me during my morning visit , and from which i might easily escape if i could find my way to the barred entrance .
it would be a labyrinthine wandering , but no worse than others out of which i had in the past found my way .
the first step was to get free of my bonds , gag , and blindfold ; and this i knew would be no great task , since subtler experts than these arabs had tried every known species of fetter upon me during my long and varied career as an exponent of escape , yet had never succeeded in defeating my methods .
then it occurred to me that the arabs might be ready to meet and attack me at the entrance upon any evidence of my probable escape from the binding cords , as would be furnished by any decided agitation of the rope which they probably held .
this , of course , was taking for granted that my place of confinement was indeed khephren temple of the sphinx .
the direct opening in the roof , wherever it might lurk , could not be beyond easy reach of the ordinary modern entrance near the sphinx ; if in truth it were any great distance at all on the surface , since the total area known to visitors is not at all enormous .
i had not noticed any such opening during my daytime pilgrimage , but knew that these things are easily overlooked amidst the drifting sands .
thinking these matters over as i lay bent and bound on the rock floor , i nearly forgot the horrors of abysmal descent and cavernous swinging which had so lately reduced me to a coma .
my present thought was only to outwit the arabs , and i accordingly determined to work myself free as quickly as possible , avoiding any tug on the descending line which might betray an effective or even problematical attempt at freedom .
this , however , was more easily determined than effected .
a few preliminary trials made it clear that little could be accomplished without considerable motion ; and it did not surprise me when , after one especially energetic struggle , i began to feel the coils of falling rope as they piled up about me and upon me .
obviously , i thought , the bedouins had felt my movements and released their end of the rope ; hastening no doubt to the temple true entrance to lie murderously in wait for me .
the prospect was not pleasing but i had faced worse in my time without flinching , and would not flinch now .
at present i must first of all free myself of bonds , then trust to ingenuity to escape from the temple unharmed .
it is curious how implicitly i had come to believe myself in the old temple of khephren beside the sphinx , only a short distance below the ground .
that belief was shattered , and every pristine apprehension of preternatural depth and demoniac mystery revived , by a circumstance which grew in horror and significance even as i formulated my philosophical plan .
i have said that the falling rope was piling up about and upon me .
now i saw that it was continuing to pile , as no rope of normal length could possibly do .
it gained in momentum and became an avalanche of hemp , accumulating mountainously on the floor and half burying me beneath its swiftly multiplying coils .
soon i was completely engulfed and gasping for breath as the increasing convolutions submerged and stifled me .
my senses tottered again , and i vaguely tried to fight off a menace desperate and ineluctable .
it was not merely that i was tortured beyond human endurance not merely that life and breath seemed to be crushed slowly out of me it was the knowledge of what those unnatural lengths of rope implied , and the consciousness of what unknown and incalculable gulfs of inner earth must at this moment be surrounding me .
my endless descent and swinging flight through goblin space , then , must have been real , and even now i must be lying helpless in some nameless cavern world toward the core of the planet .
such a sudden confirmation of ultimate horror was insupportable , and a second time i lapsed into merciful oblivion .
when i say oblivion , i do not imply that i was free from dreams .
on the contrary , my absence from the conscious world was marked by visions of the most unutterable hideousness .
god ! if only i had not read so much egyptology before coming to this land which is the fountain of all darkness and terror !
this second spell of fainting filled my sleeping mind anew with shivering realization of the country and its archaic secrets , and through some damnable chance my dreams turned to the ancient notions of the dead and their sojournings in soul and body beyond those mysterious tombs which were more houses than graves .
i recalled , in which it is well that i do not remember , the peculiar and elaborate construction of egyptian sepulchers ; and the exceedingly singular and terrific doctrines which determined this construction .
all these people thought of was death and the dead .
they conceived of a literal resurrection of the body which made them mummify it with desperate care , and preserve all the vital organs in canopic jars near the corpse ; whilst besides the body they believed in two other elements , the soul , which after its weighing and approval by osiris dwelt in the land of the blest , and the obscure and portentous ka or which wandered about the upper and lower worlds in a horrible way , demanding occasional access to the preserved body , consuming the food offerings brought by priests and pious relatives to the mortuary chapel , and sometimes as men whispered taking its body or the wooden double always buried beside it and stalking noxiously abroad on errands peculiarly repellent .
for thousands of years those bodies rested gorgeously encased and staring glassily upward when not visited by the ka , awaiting the day when osiris should restore both ka and soul , and lead forth the stiff legions of the dead from the sunken houses of sleep .
it was to have been a glorious rebirth but not all souls were approved , nor were all tombs inviolate , so that certain grotesque mistakes and fiendish abnormalities were to be looked for .
even today the arabs murmur of unsanctified convocations and unwholesome worship in forgotten nether abysses , which only winged invisible kas and soulless mummies may visit and return unscathed .
perhaps the most leeringly legends are those which relate to certain perverse products of decadent priestcraft composite mummies made by the artificial union of human trunks and limbs with the heads of animals in imitation of the elder gods .
at all stages of history the sacred animals were mummified , so that consecrated bulls , cats , ibises , crocodiles and the like might return some day to greater glory .
but only in the decadence did they mix the human and the animal in the same mummy only in the decadence , when they did not understand the rights and prerogatives of the ka and the soul .
what happened to those composite mummies is not told of at least publicly and it is certain that no egyptologist ever found one .
the whispers of arabs are very wild , and can not be relied upon .
they even hint that old khephren he of the sphinx , the second pyramid and the yawning gateway temple lives far underground wedded to the nitocris and ruling over the mummies that are neither of man nor of beast .
it was of these of khephren and his consort and his strange armies of the hybrid dead that i dreamed , and that is why i am glad the exact have faded from my memory .
my most horrible vision was connected with an idle question i had asked myself the day before when looking at the great carven riddle of the desert and wondering with what unknown depth the temple close to it might be secretly connected .
that question , so innocent and whimsical then , assumed in my dream a meaning of frenetic and hysterical madness what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?
my second awakening if awakening it was is a memory of stark hideousness which nothing else in my life save one thing which came after can parallel ; and that life has been full and adventurous beyond most men .
remember that i had lost consciousness whilst buried beneath a cascade of falling rope whose immensity revealed the cataclysmic depth of my present position .
now , as perception returned , i felt the entire weight gone ; and realized upon rolling over that although i was still tied , gagged and blindfolded , some agency had removed completely the suffocating hempen landslide which had overwhelmed me .
the significance of this condition , of course , came to me only gradually ; but even so i think it would have brought unconsciousness again had i not by this time reached such a state of emotional exhaustion that no new horror could make much difference .
i was alone with what ?
before i could torture myself with any new reflection , or make any fresh effort to escape from my bonds , an additional circumstance became manifest .
pains not formerly felt were racking my arms and legs , and i seemed coated with a profusion of dried blood beyond anything my former cuts and abrasions could furnish .
my chest , too , seemed pierced by a hundred wounds , as though some malign , titanic ibis had been pecking at it .
assuredly the agency which had removed the rope was a hostile one , and had begun to wreak terrible injuries upon me when somehow impelled to desist .
yet at the same time my sensations were distinctly the reverse of what one might expect .
instead of sinking into a bottomless pit of despair , i was stirred to a new courage and action ; for now i felt that the evil forces were physical things which a fearless man might encounter on an even basis .
on the strength of this thought i tugged again at my bonds , and used all the art of a lifetime to free myself as i had so often done amidst the glare of lights and the applause of vast crowds .
the familiar details of my escaping process commenced to engross me , and now that the long rope was gone i half regained my belief that the supreme horrors were hallucinations after all , and that there had never been any terrible shaft , measureless abyss or interminable rope .
was i after all in the gateway temple of khephren beside the sphinx , and had the sneaking arabs stolen in to torture me as i lay helpless there ?
at any rate , i must be free .
let me stand up unbound , ungagged , and with eyes open to catch any glimmer of light which might come trickling from any source , and i could actually delight in the combat against evil and treacherous foes !
how long i took in shaking off my encumbrances i can not tell .
it must have been longer than in my exhibition performances , because i was wounded , exhausted , and enervated by the experiences i had passed through .
when i was finally free , and taking deep breaths of a chill , damp , evilly spiced air all the more horrible when encountered without the screen of gag and blindfold edges , i found that i was too cramped and fatigued to move at once .
there i lay , trying to stretch a frame bent and mangled , for an indefinite period , and straining my eyes to catch a glimpse of some ray of light which would give a hint as to my position .
by degrees my strength and flexibility returned , but my eyes beheld nothing .
as i staggered to my feet i peered diligently in every direction , yet met only an ebony blackness as great as that i had known when blindfolded .
i tried my legs , beneath my shredded trousers , and found that i could walk ; yet could not decide in what direction to go .
obviously i ought not to walk at random , and perhaps retreat directly from the entrance i sought ; so i paused to note the difference of the cold , fetid , which i had never ceased to feel .
accepting the point of its source as the possible entrance to the abyss , i strove to keep track of this landmark and to walk consistently toward it .
i had a with me , and even a small electric flashlight ; but of course the pockets of my tossed and tattered clothing were long since emptied of all heavy articles .
as i walked cautiously in the blackness , the draft grew stronger and more offensive , till at length i could regard it as nothing less than a tangible stream of detestable vapor pouring out of some aperture like the smoke of the genie from the fisherman jar in the eastern tale .
the east egypt truly , this dark cradle of civilization was ever the wellspring of horrors and marvels unspeakable !
the more i reflected on the nature of this cavern wind , the greater my sense of disquiet became ; for although despite its odor i had sought its source as at least an indirect clue to the outer world , i now saw plainly that this foul emanation could have no admixture or connection whatsoever with the clean air of the libyan desert , but must be essentially a thing vomited from sinister gulfs still lower down .
i had , then , been walking in the wrong direction !
after a moment reflection i decided not to retrace my steps .
away from the draft i would have no landmarks , for the roughly level rock floor was devoid of distinctive configurations .
if , however , i followed up the strange current , i would undoubtedly arrive at an aperture of some sort , from whose gate i could perhaps work round the walls to the opposite side of this cyclopean and otherwise unnavigable hall .
that i might fail , i well realized .
i saw that this was no part of khephren gateway temple which tourists know , and it struck me that this particular hall might be unknown even to archaeologists , and merely stumbled upon by the inquisitive and malignant arabs who had imprisoned me .
if so , was there any present gate of escape to the known parts or to the outer air ?
what evidence , indeed , did i now possess that this was the gateway temple at all ?
for a moment all my wildest speculations rushed back upon me , i thought of that vivid melange of impressions descent , suspension in space , the rope , my wounds , and the dreams that were frankly dreams .
was this the end of life for me ?
or indeed , would it be merciful if this moment were the end ?
i could answer none of my own questions , but merely kept on , till fate for a third time reduced me to oblivion .
this time there were no dreams , for the suddenness of the incident shocked me out of all thought either conscious or subconscious .
tripping on an unexpected descending step at a point where the offensive draft became strong enough to offer an actual physical resistance , i was precipitated headlong down a black flight of huge stone stairs into a gulf of hideousness unrelieved .
that i ever breathed again is a tribute to the inherent vitality of the healthy human organism .
often i look back to that night and feel a touch of actual humor in those repeated lapses of consciousness ; lapses whose succession reminded me at the time of nothing more than the crude cinema melodramas of that period .
of course , it is possible that the repeated lapses never occurred ; and that all the features of that underground nightmare were merely the dreams of one long coma which began with the shock of my descent into that abyss and ended with the healing balm of the outer air and of the rising sun which found me stretched on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic and dawn flushed face of the great sphinx .
i prefer to believe this latter explanation as much as i can , hence was glad when the police told me that the barrier to krephren gateway temple had been found unfastened , and that a sizeable rift to the surface did actually exist in one corner of the still buried part .
i was glad , too , when the doctors pronounced my wounds only those to be expected from my seizure , blindfolding , lowering , struggling with bonds , falling some distance perhaps into a depression in the temple inner gallery dragging myself to the outer barrier and escaping from it , and experiences like that , a very soothing diagnosis .
and yet i know that there must be more than appears on the surface .
that extreme descent is too vivid a memory to be dismissed and it is odd that no one has ever been able to find a man answering the description of my guide , abdul reis el drogman the guide who looked and smiled like king khephren .
i have digressed from my connected narrative perhaps in the vain hope of evading the telling of that final incident ; that incident which of all is most certainly an hallucination .
but i promised to relate it , and i do not break promises .
when i recovered or seemed to recover my senses after that fall down the black stone stairs , i was quite as alone and in darkness as before .
the windy stench , bad enough before , was now fiendish ; yet i had acquired enough familiarity by this time to bear it stoically .
dazedly i began to crawl away from the place whence the putrid wind came , and with my bleeding hands felt the colossal blocks of a mighty pavement .
once my head struck against a hard object , and when i felt of it i learned that it was the base of a column a column of unbelievable immensity whose surface was covered with gigantic chiseled hieroglyphics very perceptible to my touch .
crawling on , i encountered other titan columns at incomprehensible distances apart ; when suddenly my attention was captured by the realization of something which must have been impinging on my subconscious hearing long before the conscious sense was aware of it .
from some still lower chasm in earth bowels were proceeding certain sounds , measured and definite , and like nothing i had ever heard before .
that they were very ancient and distinctly ceremonial i felt almost intuitively ; and much reading in egyptology led me to associate them with the flute , the sambuke , the sistrum , and the tympanum .
in their rhythmic piping , droning , rattling and beating i felt an element of terror beyond all the known terrors of earth a terror peculiarly dissociated from personal fear , and taking the form of a sort of objective pity for our planet , that it should hold within its depths such horrors as must lie beyond these aegipanic cacophonies .
the sounds increased in volume , and i felt that they were approaching .
then and may all the gods of all pantheons unite to keep the like from my ears again i began to hear , faintly and afar off , the morbid and millennial tramping of the marching things .
it was hideous that footfalls so dissimilar should move in such perfect rhythm .
the training of unhallowed thousands of years must lie behind that march of earth inmost monstrosities padding , clicking , walking , stalking , rumbling , lumbering , crawling and all to the abhorrent discords of those mocking instruments .
and then god keep the memory of those arab legends out of my head ! the mummies without souls the of the wandering kas the hordes of the pharaonic dead of forty centuries the composite mummies led through the uttermost onyx voids by king khephren and his ghoul queen nitocris
the tramping drew nearer heaven save me from the sound of those feet and paws and hooves and pads and talons as it commenced to acquire detail !
down limitless reaches of sunless pavement a spark of light flickered in the malodorous wind and i drew behind the enormous circumference of a cyclopic column that i might escape for a while the horror that was stalking toward me through gigantic hypostyles of inhuman dread and phobic antiquity .
the flickers increased , and the tramping and dissonant rhythm grew sickeningly loud .
in the quivering orange light there stood faintly forth a scene of such stony awe that i gasped from sheer wonder that conquered even fear and repulsion .
bases of columns whose middles were higher than human sight , mere bases of things that must each dwarf the eiffel tower to insignificance hieroglyphics carved by unthinkable hands in caverns where daylight can be only a remote legend
i would not look at the marching things .
that i desperately resolved as i heard their creaking joints and nitrous wheezing above the dead music and the dead tramping .
it was merciful that they did not speak but god !
their crazy torches began to cast shadows on the surface of those stupendous columns .
hippopotami should not have human hands and carry torches men should not have the heads of crocodiles
i tried to turn away , but the shadows and the sounds and the stench were everywhere .
then i remembered something i used to do in half conscious nightmares as a boy , and began to repeat to myself , is a dream !
this is a dream ! '
but it was of no use , and i could only shut my eyes and pray at least , that is what i think i did , for one is never sure in visions and i know this can have been nothing more .
i wondered whether i should ever reach the world again , and at times would furtively open my eyes to see if i could discern any feature of the place other than the wind of spiced putrefaction , the topless columns , and the thaumatropically grotesque shadows of abnormal horror .
the sputtering glare of multiplying torches now shone , and unless this hellish place were wholly without walls , i could not fail to see some boundary or fixed landmark soon .
but i had to shut my eyes again when i realized how many of the things were assembling and when i glimpsed a certain object walking solemnly and steadily without any body above the waist .
a fiendish and ululant or now split the very atmosphere the charnel atmosphere poisonous with naftha and bitumen blasts in one concerted chorus from the ghoulish legion of hybrid blasphemies .
my eyes , perversely shaken open , gazed for an instant upon a sight which no human creature could even imagine without panic , fear and physical exhaustion .
the things had filed ceremonially in one direction , the direction of the noisome wind , where the light of their torches showed their bended heads or the bended heads of such as had heads .
they were worshipping before a great black aperture which reached up almost out of sight , and which i could see was flanked at right angles by two giant staircases whose ends were far away in shadow .
one of these was indubitably the staircase i had fallen down .
the dimensions of the hole were fully in proportion with those of the columns an ordinary house would have been lost in it , and any average public building could easily have been moved in and out .
it was so vast a surface that only by moving the eye could one trace its boundaries so vast , so hideously black , and so aromatically stinking .
directly in front of this yawning the things were throwing objects evidently sacrifices or religious offerings , to judge by their gestures .
khephren was their leader ; sneering king khephren or the guide abdul reis , crowned with a golden pshent and intoning endless formulae with the hollow voice of the dead .
by his side knelt beautiful queen nitocris , whom i saw in profile for a moment , noting that the right half of her face was eaten away by rats or other ghouls .
and i shut my eyes again when i saw what objects were being thrown as offerings to the fetid aperture or its possible local deity .
it occurred to me that , judging from the elaborateness of this worship , the concealed deity must be one of considerable importance .
was it osiris or isis , horus or anubis , or some vast unknown god of the dead still more central and supreme ?
there is a legend that terrible altars and colossi were reared to an unknown one before ever the known gods were worshipped and now , as i steeled myself to watch the rapt and sepulchral adorations of those nameless things , a thought of escape flashed upon me .
the hall was dim , and the columns heavy with shadow .
with every creature of that nightmare throng absorbed in shocking raptures , it might be barely possible for me to creep past to the end of one of the staircases and ascend unseen ; trusting to fate and skill to deliver me from the upper reaches .
where i was , i neither knew nor seriously reflected upon and for a moment it struck me as amusing to plan a serious escape from that which i knew to be a dream .
was i in some hidden and unsuspected lower realm of khephren gateway temple that temple which generations have persistently called the temple of the sphinx ?
i could not conjecture , but i resolved to ascend to life and consciousness if wit and muscle could carry me .
wriggling flat on my stomach , i began the anxious journey toward the foot of the staircase , which seemed the more accessible of the two .
i can not describe the incidents and sensations of that crawl , but they may be guessed when one reflects on what i had to watch steadily in that malign , torchlight in order to avoid detection .
the bottom of the staircase was , as i have said , far away in shadow , as it had to be to rise without a bend to the dizzy parapeted landing above the titanic aperture .
this placed the last stages of my crawl at some distance from the noisome herd , though the spectacle chilled me even when quite remote at my right .
at length i succeeded in reaching the steps and began to climb ; keeping close to the wall , on which i observed decorations of the most hideous sort , and relying for safety on the absorbed , ecstatic interest with which the monstrosities watched the aperture and the impious objects of nourishment they had flung on the pavement before it .
though the staircase was huge and steep , fashioned of vast porphyry blocks as if for the feet of a giant , the ascent seemed virtually interminable .
dread of discovery and the pain which renewed exercise had brought to my wounds combined to make that upward crawl a thing of agonizing memory .
i had intended , on reaching the landing , to climb immediately onward along whatever upper staircase might mount from there ; stopping for no last look at the carrion abominations that pawed and genuflected some seventy or eighty feet below yet a sudden repetition of that thunderous and chorus , coming as i had nearly gained the top of the flight and showing by its ceremonial rhythm that it was not an alarm of my discovery , caused me to pause and peer cautiously over the parapet .
the monstrosities were hailing something which had poked itself out of the nauseous aperture to seize the hellish fare proffered it .
it was something quite ponderous , even as seen from my height ; something yellowish and hairy , and endowed with a sort of nervous motion .
it was as large , perhaps , as a hippopotamus , but very curiously shaped .
it seemed to have no neck , but five separate shaggy heads springing in a row from a roughly cylindrical trunk ; the first very small , the second , the third and fourth equal and largest of all , and the fifth rather small , though not so small as the first .
out of these heads darted curious rigid tentacles which seized ravenously on the excessively great quantities of unmentionable food placed before the aperture .
once in a while the thing would leap up , and occasionally it would retreat into its den in a very odd manner .
its locomotion was so inexplicable that i stared in fascination , wishing it would emerge farther from the cavernous lair beneath me .
then it did emerge it did emerge , and at the sight i turned and fled into the darkness up the higher staircase that rose behind me ; fled unknowingly up incredible steps and ladders and inclined planes to which no human sight or logic guided me , and which i must ever relegate to the world of dreams for want of any confirmation .
it must have been a dream , or the dawn would never have found me breathing on the sands of gizeh before the sardonic face of the great sphinx .
the great sphinx !
god ! that idle question i asked myself on that sun blest morning before what huge and loathsome abnormality was the sphinx originally carven to represent ?
accursed is the sight , be it in dream or not , that revealed to me the supreme horror the unknown god of the dead , which licks its colossal chops in the unsuspected abyss , fed hideous morsels by soulless absurdities that should not exist .
the monster that emerged that monster as large as a hippopotamus the five headed monster and that of which it is the merest forepaw
but i survived , and i know it was only a dream .
birch acquired a limitation and changed his business in , yet never discussed the case when he could avoid it .
neither did his old physician davis , who died years ago .
it was generally stated that the affliction and shock were results of an unlucky slip whereby birch had locked himself for nine hours in the receiving tomb of peck valley cemetery , escaping only by crude and disastrous mechanical means ; but while this much was undoubtedly true , there were other and blacker things which the man used to whisper to me in his drunken delirium toward the last .
he confided in me because i was his doctor , and because he probably felt the need of confiding in someone else after davis died .
he was a bachelor , wholly without relatives .
birch , before , had been the village undertaker of peck valley ; and was a very calloused and primitive specimen even as such specimens go .
the practices i heard attributed to him would be unbelievable today , at least in a city ; and even peck valley would have shuddered a bit had it known the easy ethics of its mortuary artist in such debatable matters as the ownership of costly apparel invisible beneath the casket lid , and the degree of dignity to be maintained in posing and adapting the unseen members of lifeless tenants to containers not always calculated with sublimest accuracy .
most distinctly birch was lax , insensitive , and professionally undesirable ; yet i still think he was not an evil man .
he was merely crass of fibre and function thoughtless , careless , and liquorish , as his easily avoidable accident proves , and without that modicum of imagination which holds the average citizen within certain limits fixed by taste .
just where to begin birch story i can hardly decide , since i am no practiced teller of tales .
i suppose one should start in the cold december of , when the ground froze and the cemetery delvers found they could dig no more graves till spring .
fortunately the village was small and the death rate low , so that it was possible to give all of birch inanimate charges a temporary haven in the single antiquated receiving tomb .
the undertaker grew doubly lethargic in the bitter weather , and seemed to outdo even himself in carelessness .
never did he knock together flimsier and ungainlier caskets , or disregard more flagrantly the needs of the rusty lock on the tomb door which he slammed open and shut with such nonchalant abandon .
at last the spring thaw came , and graves were laboriously prepared for the nine silent harvests of the grim reaper which waited in the tomb .
birch , though dreading the bother of removal and interment , began his task of transference one disagreeable april morning , but ceased before noon because of a heavy rain that seemed to irritate his horse , after having laid but one mortal tenent to its permanent rest .
that was darius peck , the nonagenarian , whose grave was not far from the tomb .
birch decided that he would begin the next day with little old matthew fenner , whose grave was also near by ; but actually postponed the matter for three days , not getting to work till good friday , the .
being without superstition , he did not heed the day at all ; though ever afterward he refused to do anything of importance on that fateful sixth day of the week .
certainly , the events of that evening greatly changed george birch .
on the afternoon of friday , april , then , birch set out for the tomb with horse and wagon to transfer the body of matthew fenner .
that he was not perfectly sober , he subsequently admitted ; though he had not then taken to the wholesale drinking by which he later tried to forget certain things .
he was just dizzy and careless enough to annoy his sensitive horse , which as he drew it viciously up at the tomb neighed and pawed and tossed its head , much as on that former occasion when the rain had vexed it .
the day was clear , but a high wind had sprung up ; and birch was glad to get to shelter as he unlocked the iron door and entered the vault .
another might not have relished the damp , odorous chamber with the eight carelessly placed coffins ; but birch in those days was insensitive , and was concerned only in getting the right coffin for the right grave .
he had not forgotten the criticism aroused when hannah bixby relatives , wishing to transport her body to the cemetery in the city whither they had moved , found the casket of judge capwell beneath her headstone .
the light was dim , but birch sight was good , and he did not get asaph sawyer coffin by mistake , although it was very similar .
he had , indeed , made that coffin for matthew fenner ; but had cast it aside at last as too awkward and flimsy , in a fit of curious sentimentality aroused by recalling how kindly and generous the little old man had been to him during his bankruptcy five years before .
he gave old matt the very best his skill could produce , but was thrifty enough to save the rejected specimen , and to use it when asaph sawyer died of a malignant fever .
sawyer was not a lovable man , and many stories were told of his almost inhuman vindictiveness and tenacious memory for wrongs real or fancied .
to him birch had felt no compunction in assigning the carelessly made coffin which he now pushed out of the way in his quest for the fenner casket .
it was just as he had recognised old matt coffin that the door slammed to in the wind , leaving him in a dusk even deeper than before .
the narrow transom admitted only the feeblest of rays , and the overhead ventilation funnel virtually none at all ; so that he was reduced to a profane fumbling as he made his halting way among the long boxes toward the latch .
in this funereal twilight he rattled the rusty handles , pushed at the iron panels , and wondered why the massive portal had grown so suddenly recalcitrant .
in this twilight too , he began to realise the truth and to shout loudly as if his horse outside could do more than neigh an unsympathetic reply .
for the long neglected latch was obviously broken , leaving the careless undertaker trapped in the vault , a victim of his own oversight .
the thing must have happened at about in the afternoon .
birch , being by temperament phlegmatic and practical , did not shout long ; but proceeded to grope about for some tools which he recalled seeing in a corner of the tomb .
it is doubtful whether he was touched at all by the horror and exquisite weirdness of his position , but the bald fact of imprisonment so far from the daily paths of men was enough to exasperate him thoroughly .
his day work was sadly interrupted , and unless chance presently brought some rambler hither , he might have to remain all night or longer .
the pile of tools soon reached , and a hammer and chisel selected , birch returned over the coffins to the door .
the air had begun to be exceedingly unwholesome ; but to this detail he paid no attention as he toiled , half by feeling , at the heavy and corroded metal of the latch .
he would have given much for a lantern or bit of candle ; but lacking these , bungled semi sightlessly as best he might .
when he perceived that the latch was hopelessly unyielding , at least to such meagre tools and under such tenebrous conditions as these , birch glanced about for other possible points of escape .
the vault had been dug from a hillside , so that the narrow ventilation funnel in the top ran through several feet of earth , making this direction utterly useless to consider .
over the door , however , the high , transom in the brick facade gave promise of possible enlargement to a diligent worker ; hence upon this his eyes long rested as he racked his brains for means to reach it .
there was nothing like a ladder in the tomb , and the coffin niches on the sides and rear which birch seldom took the trouble to use afforded no ascent to the space above the door .
only the coffins themselves remained as potential stepping stones , and as he considered these he speculated on the best mode of transporting them .
three , he reckoned , would permit him to reach the transom ; but he could do better with four .
the boxes were fairly even , and could be piled up like blocks ; so he began to compute how he might most stably use the eight to rear a scalable platform four deep .
as he planned , he could not but wish that the units of his contemplated staircase had been more securely made .
whether he had imagination enough to wish they were empty , is strongly to be doubted .
finally he decided to lay a base of three parallel with the wall , to place upon this two layers of two each , and upon these a single box to serve as the platform .
this arrangement could be ascended with a minimum of awkwardness , and would furnish the desired height .
better still , though , he would utilise only two boxes of the base to support the superstructure , leaving one free to be piled on top in case the actual feat of escape required an even greater altitude .
and so the prisoner toiled in the twilight , heaving the unresponsive remnants of mortality with little ceremony as his miniature tower of babel rose course by course .
several of the coffins began to split under the stress of handling , and he planned to save the stoutly built casket of little matthew fenner for the top , in order that his feet might have as certain a surface as possible .
in the he trusted mostly to touch to select the right one , and indeed came upon it almost by accident , since it tumbled into his hands as if through some odd volition after he had unwittingly placed it beside another on the third layer .
the tower at length finished , and his aching arms rested by a pause during which he sat on the bottom step of his grim device , birch cautiously ascended with his tools and stood abreast of the narrow transom .
the borders of the space were entirely of brick , and there seemed little doubt but that he could shortly chisel away enough to allow his body to pass .
as his hammer blows began to fall , the horse outside whinnied in a tone which may have been encouraging and to others may have been mocking .
in either case it would have been appropriate ; for the unexpected tenacity of the brickwork was surely a sardonic commentary on the vanity of mortal hopes , and the source of a task whose performance deserved every possible stimulus .
dusk fell and found birch still toiling .
he worked largely by feeling now , since newly gathered clouds hid the moon ; and though progress was still slow , he felt heartened at the extent of his encroachments on the top and bottom of the aperture .
he could , he was sure , get out by midnight though it is characteristic of him that this thought was untinged with eerie implications .
undisturbed by oppressive reflections on the time , the place , and the company beneath his feet , he philosophically chipped away the stony brickwork ; cursing when a fragment hit him in the face , and laughing when one struck the increasingly excited horse that pawed near the cypress tree .
in time the hole grew so large that he ventured to try his body in it now and then , shifting about so that the coffins beneath him rocked and creaked .
he would not , he found , have to pile another on his platform to make the proper height ; for the hole was on exactly the right level to use as soon as its size might permit .
it must have been midnight at least when birch decided he could get through the transom .
tired and perspiring despite many rests , he descended to the floor and sat a while on the bottom box to gather strength for the final wriggle and leap to the ground outside .
the hungry horse was neighing repeatedly and almost uncannily , and he vaguely wished it would stop .
he was curiously unelated over his impending escape , and almost dreaded the exertion , for his form had the indolent stoutness of early middle age .
as he remounted the splitting coffins he felt his weight very poignantly ; especially when , upon reaching the topmost one , he heard that aggravated crackle which bespeaks the wholesale rending of wood .
he had , it seems , planned in vain when choosing the stoutest coffin for the platform ; for no sooner was his full bulk again upon it than the rotting lid gave way , jouncing him two feet down on a surface which even he did not care to imagine .
maddened by the sound , or by the stench which billowed forth even to the open air , the waiting horse gave a scream that was too frantic for a neigh , and plunged madly off through the night , the wagon rattling crazily behind it .
birch , in his ghastly situation , was now too low for an easy scramble out of the enlarged transom ; but gathered his energies for a determined try .
clutching the edges of the aperture , he sought to pull himself up , when he noticed a queer retardation in the form of an apparent drag on both his ankles .
in another moment he knew fear for the first time that night ; for struggle as he would , he could not shake clear of the unknown grasp which held his feet in relentless captivity .
horrible pains , as of savage wounds , shot through his calves ; and in his mind was a vortex of fright mixed with an unquenchable materialism that suggested splinters , loose nails , or some other attribute of a breaking wooden box .
perhaps he screamed .
at any rate he kicked and squirmed frantically and automatically whilst his consciousness was almost eclipsed in a .
instinct guided him in his wriggle through the transom , and in the crawl which followed his jarring thud on the damp ground .
he could not walk , it appeared , and the emerging moon must have witnessed a horrible sight as he dragged his bleeding ankles toward the cemetery lodge ; his fingers clawing the black mould in brainless haste , and his body responding with that maddening slowness from which one suffers when chased by the phantoms of nightmare .
there was evidently , however , no pursuer ; for he was alone and alive when armington , the , answered his feeble clawing at the door .
armington helped birch to the outside of a spare bed and sent his little son edwin for davis .
the afflicted man was fully conscious , but would say nothing of any consequence ; merely muttering such things as oh , my ankles !
, let go !
, or shut in the tomb .
then the doctor came with his and asked crisp questions , and removed the patient outer clothing , shoes , and socks .
the wounds for both ankles were frightfully lacerated about the achilles ' tendons seemed to puzzle the old physician greatly , and finally almost to frighten him .
his questioning grew more than medically tense , and his hands shook as he dressed the mangled members ; binding them as if he wished to get the wounds out of sight as quickly as possible .
for an impersonal doctor , davis ' ominous and awestruck became very strange indeed as he sought to drain from the weakened undertaker every least detail of his horrible experience .
he was oddly anxious to know if birch were sure absolutely sure of the identity of that top coffin of the pile ; how he had chosen it , how he had been certain of it as the fenner coffin in the dusk , and how he had distinguished it from the inferior duplicate coffin of vicious asaph sawyer .
would the firm fenner casket have caved in so readily ?
davis , an village practitioner , had of course seen both at the respective funerals , as indeed he had attended both fenner and sawyer in their last illnesses .
he had even wondered , at sawyer funeral , how the vindictive farmer had managed to lie straight in a box so closely akin to that of the diminutive fenner .
after a full two hours davis left , urging birch to insist at all times that his wounds were caused entirely by loose nails and splintering wood .
what else , he added , could ever in any case be proved or believed ?
but it would be well to say as little as could be said , and to let no other doctor treat the wounds .
birch heeded this advice all the rest of his life till he told me his story ; and when i saw the scars ancient and whitened as they then were i agreed that he was wise in so doing .
he always remained lame , for the great tendons had been severed ; but i think the greatest lameness was in his soul .
his thinking processes , once so phlegmatic and logical , had become ineffaceably scarred ; and it was pitiful to note his response to certain chance allusions such as friday , tomb , coffin , and words of less obvious concatenation .
his frightened horse had gone home , but his frightened wits never quite did that .
he changed his business , but something always preyed upon him .
it may have been just fear , and it may have been fear mixed with a queer belated sort of remorse for bygone crudities .
his drinking , of course , only aggravated what it was meant to alleviate .
when davis left birch that night he had taken a lantern and gone to the old receiving tomb .
the moon was shining on the scattered brick fragments and marred facade , and the latch of the great door yielded readily to a touch from the outside .
steeled by old ordeals in dissecting rooms , the doctor entered and looked about , stifling the nausea of mind and body that everything in sight and smell induced .
he cried aloud once , and a little later gave a gasp that was more terrible than a cry .
then he fled back to the lodge and broke all the rules of his calling by rousing and shaking his patient , and hurling at him a succession of shuddering whispers that seared into the bewildered ears like the hissing of vitriol .
it was asaph coffin , birch , just as i thought !
i knew his teeth , with the front ones missing on the upper jaw never , for god sake , show those wounds !
the body was pretty badly gone , but if ever i saw vindictiveness on any face or former face you know what a fiend he was for revenge how he ruined old raymond thirty years after their boundary suit , and how he stepped on the puppy that snapped at him a year ago last august he was the devil incarnate , birch , and i believe his fury could beat old father death himself .
god , what a rage !
i hate to have it aimed at me !
why did you do it , birch ?
he was a scoundrel , and i do blame you for giving him a coffin , but you always did go too damned far !
well enough to skimp on the thing some way , but you knew what a little man old fenner was .
i never get the picture out of my head as long as i live .
you kicked hard , for asaph coffin was on the floor .
his head was broken in , and everything was tumbled about .
i seen sights before , but there was one thing too much here .
an eye for an eye !
great heavens , birch , but you got what you deserved .
the skull turned my stomach , but the other was worse those ankles cut neatly off to fit matt fenner coffin !
it was a lonely and deserted country , but at last i spied a roof among a clump of trees near the small river on my right ; perhaps a full from the road , and probably reachable by some path or drive which i would presently come upon .
in the absence of any nearer dwelling , i resolved to try my luck there ; and was glad when the bushes by the roadside revealed the ruin of a carved stone gateway , covered with dry , dead vines and choked with undergrowth which explained why i had not been able to trace the path across the fields in my first distant view .
i saw that i could not drive the car in , so i parked it very carefully near the gate where a thick evergreen would shield it in case of rain and got out for the long walk to the house .
traversing that path in the gathering twilight i was conscious of a distinct sense of foreboding , probably induced by the air of sinister decay hovering about the gate and the former driveway .
from the carvings on the old stone pillars i inferred that this place was once an estate of manorial dignity ; and i could clearly see that the driveway had originally boasted guardian lines of linden trees , some of which had died , while others had lost their special identity among the wild scrub growths of the region .
as i ploughed onward , cockleburs and stickers clung to my clothes , and i began to wonder whether the place could be inhabited after all .
was i tramping on a vain errand ?
for a moment i was tempted to go back and try some farm farther along the road , when a view of the house ahead aroused my curiosity and stimulated my venturesome spirit .
there was something provocatively fascinating in the , decrepit pile before me , for it spoke of the graces and spaciousness of a bygone era and a far more southerly environment .
it was a typical wooden plantation house of the classic , early pattern , with two and a half stories and a great ionic portico whose pillars reached up as far as the attic and supported a triangular pediment .
its state of decay was extreme and obvious ; one of the vast columns having rotted and fallen to the ground , while the upper piazza or balcony had sagged dangerously low .
other buildings , i judged , had formerly stood near it .
as i mounted the broad stone steps to the low porch and the carved and fanlighted doorway i felt distinctly nervous , and started to light a cigarette desisting when i saw how dry and inflammable everything about me was .
though now convinced that the house was deserted , i nevertheless hesitated to violate its dignity without knocking ; so tugged at the rusty iron knocker until i could get it to move , and finally set up a cautious rapping which seemed to make the whole place shake and rattle .
there was no response , yet once more i plied the cumbrous , creaking device as much to dispel the sense of unholy silence and solitude as to arouse any possible occupant of the ruin .
somewhere near the river i heard the mournful note of a dove , and it seemed as if the coursing water itself were faintly audible .
half in a dream , i seized and rattled the ancient latch , and finally gave the great door a frank trying .
it was unlocked , as i could see in a moment ; and though it stuck and grated on its hinges i began to push it open , stepping through it into a vast shadowy hall as i did so .
but the moment i took this step i regretted it .
it was not that a legion of specters confronted me in that dim and dusty hall with the ghostly empire furniture ; but that i knew all at once that the place was not deserted at all .
there was a creaking on the great curved staircase , and the sound of faltering footsteps slowly descending .
then i saw a tall , bent figure silhouetted for an instant against the great palladian window on the landing .
my first start of terror was soon over , and as the figure descended the final flight i was ready to greet the householder whose privacy i had invaded .
in the i could see him reach in his pocket for a match .
there came a flare as he lighted a small kerosene lamp which stood on a rickety console table near the foot of the stairs .
in the feeble glow was revealed the stooping figure of a very tall , emaciated old man ; disordered as to dress and unshaved as to face , yet for all that with the bearing and expression of a gentleman .
i did not wait for him to speak , but at once began to explain my presence .
you pardon my coming in like this , but when my knocking did raise anybody i concluded that no one lived here .
what i wanted originally was to know the right road to cape girardeau the shortest road , that is .
i wanted to get there before dark , but now , of course as i paused , the man spoke ; in exactly the cultivated tone i had expected , and with a mellow accent as unmistakably southern as the house he inhabited .
rather , you must pardon me for not answering your knock more promptly .
i live in a very retired way , and am not usually expecting visitors .
at first i thought you were a mere .
then when you knocked again i started to answer , but i am not well and have to move very slowly .
spinal neuritis very troublesome case .
but as for your getting to town before dark it plain you ca do that .
the road you are on for i suppose you came from the gate is the best or shortest way .
what you must do is to take your first left after you leave the gate that is , the first real road to your left .
there are three or four cart paths you can ignore , but you ca mistake the real road because of the extra large willow tree on the right just opposite it .
then when you turned , keep on past two roads and turn to the right along the third .
after that please wait a moment !
how can i follow all these clues in pitch darkness , without ever having been near here before , and with only an indifferent pair of headlights to tell me what is and what is a road ?
besides , i think it going to storm pretty soon , and my car is an open one .
it looks as if i were in a bad fix if i want to get to cape girardeau tonight .
the fact is , i do think i better try to make it .
i do like to impose burdens , or anything like that but in view of the circumstances , do you suppose you could put me up for the night ?
i wo be any trouble no meals or anything .
just let me have a corner to sleep in till daylight , and i all right .
i can leave the car in the road where it is a bit of wet weather wo hurt it if worst comes to worst .
as i made my sudden request i could see the old man face lose its former expression of quiet resignation and take on an odd , surprised look .
sleep here ?
he seemed so astonished at my request that i repeated it .
yes , why not ?
i assure you i wo be any trouble .
what else can i do ?
i a stranger hereabouts , these roads are a labyrinth in the dark , and i wager it be raining torrents outside of an hour this time it my host turn to interrupt , and as he did so i could feel a peculiar quality in his deep , musical voice .
a stranger of course you must be , else you would think of sleeping here , would think of coming here at all .
people do come here nowadays .
he paused , and my desire to stay was increased a thousandfold by the sense of mystery his laconic words seemed to evoke .
there was surely something alluringly queer about this place , and the pervasive musty smell seemed to cloak a thousand secrets .
again i noticed the extreme decrepitude of everything about me ; manifest even in the feeble rays of the single small lamp .
i felt woefully chilly , and saw with regret that no heating was provided , and yet so great was my curiosity that i still wished most ardently to stay and learn something of the recluse and his dismal abode .
let that be as it may , i replied .
i ca help about other people .
but i surely would like to have a spot to stop till daylight .
still if people do relish this place , may it be because it getting so ?
of course i suppose it would a take a fortune to keep such an estate up , but if the burden too great why do you look for smaller quarters ?
why try to stick it out here in this way with all the hardships and discomforts ?
the man did not seem offended , but answered me very gravely .
surely you may stay if you really wish to you can come to no harm that i know of .
but others claim there are certain peculiarly undesirable influences here .
as for me i stay here because i have to .
there is something i feel it a duty to guard something that holds me .
i wish i had the money and health and ambition to take decent care of the house and grounds .
with my curiosity still more heightened , i prepared to take my host at his word ; and followed him slowly upstairs when he motioned me to do so .
it was very dark now , and a faint pattering outside told me that the threatened rain had come .
i would have been glad of any shelter , but this was doubly welcome because of the hints of mystery about the place and its master .
for an incurable lover of the grotesque , no more fitting haven could have been provided .
there was a corner room in less unkempt shape than the rest of the house , and into this my host led me , setting down his small lamp and lighting a somewhat larger one .
from the cleanliness and contents of the room , and from the books ranged along the walls , i could see that i had not guessed amiss in thinking the man a gentleman of taste and of breeding .
he was a hermit and eccentric , no doubt , but he still had standards and intellectual interests .
as he waved me to a seat i began a conversation on general topics , and was pleased to find him not at all taciturn .
if anything , he seemed glad of someone to talk to , and did not even attempt to swerve the discussion from personal topics .
he was , i learned , one antoine de russy , of an ancient , powerful , and cultivated line of louisiana planters .
more than a century ago his grandfather , a younger son , had migrated to southern missouri and founded a new estate in the lavish ancestral manner ; building this pillared mansion and surrounding it with all the accessories of a great plantation .
there had been , at one time , as many as negroes in the cabins which stood on the flat ground in the rear ground that the river had now invaded and to hear them singing and laughing and playing the banjo at night was to know the fullest charm of a civilization and social order now sadly extinct .
in front of the house , where the great guardian oaks and willows stood , there had been a lawn like a broad green carpet , always watered and trimmed and with flagstoned , walks curving through it .
riverside for such the place was called had been a lovely and idyllic homestead in its day ; and my host could recall it when many traces of its best period remained .
it was raining hard now , with dense sheets of water beating against the insecure roof , walls , and windows , and sending in drops through a thousand chinks and crevices .
moisture trickled down to the floor from unsuspected places , and the mounting wind rattled the rotting , shutters outside .
but i minded none of this , for i saw that a story was coming .
incited to reminiscence , my host made a move to shew me to ; but kept on recalling the older , better days .
soon , i saw , i would receive an inkling of why he lived alone in that ancient place , and why his neighbours thought it full of undesirable influences .
his voice was very musical as he spoke on , and his tale soon took a turn which left me no chance to grow drowsy .
yes riverside was built in , and my father was born in .
he be over a century old now if he were alive , but he died young so young i can just barely remember him .
in that was he was killed in the war , seventh louisiana infantry , for he went back to the old home to enlist .
my grandfather was too old to fight , yet he lived on to be , and helped my mother bring me up .
a good , too i give them credit .
we always had strong traditions high notions of honor and my grandfather saw to it that i grew up the way de russys have grown up , generation after generation , ever since the crusades .
we were quite wiped out financially , but managed to get on very comfortable after the war .
i went to a good school in louisiana , and later to princeton .
later on i was able to get the plantation on a fairly profitable basis though you see what it come to now .
my mother died when i was twenty , and my grandfather two years later .
it was rather lonely after that ; and in i married a distant cousin in new orleans .
things might have been different if she lived , but she died when my son denis was born .
then i had only denis .
i did try marriage again , but gave all my time to the boy .
he was like me like all the de russys darkish and tall and thin , and with the devil of a temper .
i gave him the same training my grandfather had give me , but he did need much training when it came to points of honor .
it was in him , i reckon .
never saw such high spirit all i could do to keep him from running away to the spanish war when he was eleven !
romantic young devil , too full of high notions you call victorian , now no trouble at all to make him let the nigger wenches alone .
i sent him to the same school i gone to , and to princeton , too .
he was class of .
in the end he decided to be a doctor , and went a year to the harvard medical school .
then he hit on the idea of keeping to the old french tradition of the family , and argued me into sending him across to the sorbonne .
i did and proudly enough , though i knew how lonely i be with him so far off .
would to god i had !
i thought he was the safest kind of boy to be in paris .
he had a room in the rue jacques that near the university in the quarter ' but according to his letters and his friends he did cut up with the gayer dogs at all .
the people he knew were mostly young fellows from home serious students and artists who thought more of their work than of striking attitudes and painting the town red .
but of course there were lots of fellows who were on a sort of dividing line between serious studies and the devil .
the aesthetes the decadents , you know .
experiments in life and sensation the baudelaire kind of a chap .
naturally denis ran up against a good many of these , and saw a good deal of their life .
they had all sorts of crazy circles and cults imitation , fake black masses , and the like .
doubt if it did them much harm on the whole probably most of forgot all about it in a year or two .
one of the deepest in this queer stuff was a fellow denis had known at school for that matter , whose father i known myself .
frank marsh , of new orleans .
disciple of lafcadio hearn and gauguin and van gogh regular epitome of the yellow .
poor devil he had the makings of a great artist , at that .
marsh was the oldest friend denis had in paris , so as a matter of course they saw a good deal of each other to talk over old times at clair academy , and all that .
the boy wrote me a good deal about him , and i did see any especial harm when he spoke of the group of mystics marsh ran with .
it seems there was some cult of prehistoric egyptian and carthaginian magic having a rage among the bohemian element on the left bank some nonsensical thing that pretended to reach back to forgotten sources of hidden truth in lost african civilisations the great zimbabwe , the dead atlantean cities in the haggar region of the sahara and they had a lot of gibberish concerned with snakes and human hair .
at least , i called it gibberish , then .
denis used to quote marsh as saying odd things about the veiled facts behind the legend of medusa snaky locks and behind the later ptolemaic myth of berenice , who offered up her hair to save her , and had it set in the sky as the constellation coma berenices .
i do think this business made much impression on denis until the night of the queer ritual at marsh rooms when he met the priestess .
most of the devotees of the cult were young fellows , but the head of it was a young woman who called herself ' letting it be known that her real name her name in this latest incarnation , as she put it was marceline bedard .
she claimed to be the daughter of marquis de chameaux , and seemed to have been both a petty artist and an artist model before adopting this more lucrative magical game .
someone said she had lived for a time in the west indies martinique , i think but she was very reticent about herself .
part of her pose was a great show of austerity and holiness , but i do think the more experienced students took that very seriously .
denis , though , was far from experienced , and wrote me fully ten pages of slush about the goddess he had discovered .
if i only realised his simplicity i might have done something , but i never thought a puppy infatuation like could mean much .
i felt absurdly sure that denis ' touchy personal honour and family pride would always keep him out of the most serious complications .
as time went , though , his letters began to make me nervous .
he mentioned this marceline more and more , and his friends less and less , and began talking about the and silly way ' they declined to introduce her to their mothers and sisters .
he seems to have asked her no questions about herself , and i do doubt but that she filled him full of romantic legendry concerning her origin and divine revelations and the way people slighted her .
at length i could see that denis was altogether cutting his own crowd and spending the bulk of his time with his alluring priestess .
at her especial request he never told the old crowd of their continual meetings ; so nobody over there tried to break the affair up .
i suppose she thought he was fabulously rich ; for he had the air of a patrician , and people of a certain class think all aristocratic americans are wealthy .
in any case , she probably thought this a rare chance to contract a genuine alliance with a really eligible young man .
by the time my nervousness burst into open advice , it was too late .
the boy had lawfully married her , and wrote that he was dropping his studies and bringing the woman home to riverside .
he said she had made a great sacrifice and resigned her leadership of the magical cult , and that henceforward she would be merely a private gentlewoman the future mistress of riverside , and mother of de russys to come .
well , sir , i took it the best way i could .
i knew that sophisticated continentals have different standards from our old american ones and anyway , i really knew nothing against the woman .
a charlatan , perhaps , but why necessarily any worse ?
i suppose i tried to keep as naïve as possible about such things in those days , for the boy sake .
clearly , there was nothing for a man of sense to do but let denis alone so long as his new wife conformed to de russy ways .
let her have a chance to prove herself perhaps she would hurt the family as much as some might fear .
so i did raise any objections or ask any penitence .
the thing was done , and i stood ready to welcome the boy back , whatever he brought with him .
they got here three weeks after the telegram telling of marriage .
marceline was beautiful there was no denying that and i could see how the boy might very well get foolish about her .
she did have an air of breeding , and i think to this day she must have had some strains of good blood in her .
she was apparently not much over twenty ; of medium size , fairly slim , and as graceful as a tigress in posture and motion .
her complexion was a deep olive like old ivory and her eyes were large and very dark .
she had small , classically regular features though not quite enough to suit my taste and the most singular braid of jet black hair that i ever saw .
i did wonder that she had dragged the subject of hair into her magical cult , for with that heavy profusion of it the idea must have occurred to her naturally .
coiled up , it made her look like some oriental princess in a drawing of aubrey beardsley .
hanging down her back , it came well below her knees and shone in the light as if it had possessed some separate , unholy vitality of its own .
i would almost have thought of medusa or berenice myself without having such things suggested to me upon seeing and studying that hair .
sometimes i thought it moved slightly of itself , and tended to arrange itself in distinct ropes or strands , but this may have been sheer illusion .
she braided it incessantly , and seemed to use some sort of preparation on it .
i got the notion once a curious , whimsical notion that it was a living being which she had to feed in some strange way .
all nonsense but it added to my feeling of constraint about her and her hair .
for i ca deny that i failed to like her wholly , no matter how hard i tried .
i could tell what the trouble was , but it was there .
something about her repelled me very subtly , and i could not help weaving morbid and macabre associations about everything connected with her .
her complexion called up thoughts of babylon , atlantis , lemuria , and the terrible forgotten dominations of an elder world ; her eyes struck me sometimes as the eyes of some unholy forest creature or animal goddess too immeasurably ancient to be fully human ; and her hair that dense , exotic , overnourished growth of oily inkiness made one shiver as a great black python might have done .
there was no doubt but that she realised my involuntary attitude though i tried to hide it , and she tried to hide the fact that she noticed it .
yet the boy infatuation lasted .
he positively fawned on her , and overdid all the little gallantries of daily life to a sickening degree .
she appeared to return the feeling , though i could see it took a conscious effort to make her duplicate his enthusiasms and extravagances .
for one thing , i think she was piqued to learn we were as wealthy as she had expected .
it was a bad business all told .
i could see that sad undercurrents were arising .
denis was with , and began to grow away from me as he felt my shrinking from his wife .
this kind of thing went on for months , and i saw that i was losing my only son the boy who had formed the centre of all my thoughts and acts for the past quarter century .
i own that i felt bitter about it what father would ?
and yet i could do nothing .
marceline seemed to be a good wife enough in those early months , and our friends received her without any quibbling or questioning .
i was always nervous , though , about what some of the young fellows in paris might write home to their relatives after the news of the marriage spread around .
despite the woman love of secrecy , it could remain hidden forever indeed , denis had written a few of his closest friends , in strict confidence , as soon as he was settled with her at riverside .
i got to staying alone in my room more and more , with my failing health as an excuse .
it was about that time that my present spinal neuritis began to develop which made the excuse a pretty good one .
denis did seem to notice the trouble , or take any interest in me and my habits and affairs ; and it hurt me to see how callous he was getting .
i began to get sleepless , and often racked my brain in the night to try to find out what made my new so repulsive and even dimly horrible to me .
it surely was her old mystical nonsense , for she had left all the past behind her and never mentioned it once .
she did even do any painting , although i understood that she had once dabbled in art .
oddly , the only ones who seemed to share my uneasiness were the servants .
the darkies around the house seemed very sullen in their attitude toward her , and in a few weeks all save the few who were strongly attached to our family had left .
these few old scipio and his wife sarah , the cook delilah , and mary , scipio daughter were as civil as possible ; but plainly revealed that their new mistress commanded their duty rather than their affection .
they stayed in their own remote part of the house as much as possible .
mccabe , our white chauffeur , was insolently admiring rather than hostile ; and another exception was a very old zulu woman , said to have been a sort of leader in her small cabin as a kind of family pensioner .
old sophonisba always shewed reverence whenever marceline came near her , and one time i saw her kiss the ground where her mistress had walked .
blacks are superstitious animals , and i wondered whether marceline had been talking any of her mystical nonsense to our hands in order to overcome their evident dislike .
well , that how we went on for nearly half a year .
then , in the summer of , things began to happen .
toward the middle of june denis got a note from his old friend frank marsh , telling of a sort of nervous breakdown which made him want to take a rest in the country .
it was postmarked new orleans for marsh had gone home from paris when he felt the collapse coming on and seemed a very plain though polite bid for an invitation from us .
marsh , of course , knew that marceline was here ; and asked very courteously after her .
denis was sorry to hear of his trouble and told him at once to come along for an indefinite visit .
marsh came and i was shocked to notice how he had changed since i had seen him in his earlier days .
he was a smallish , lightish fellow , with blue eyes and an undecided chin ; and now i could see the effects of drink and i do know what else in his puffy eyelids , enlarged , and heavy lines around the mouth .
i reckon he had taken his dose of decadence pretty seriously , and set out to be as much of a rimbaud , baudelaire , or lautreamont as he could .
and yet he was delightful to talk to for like all decadents he was exquisitely sensitive to the color and atmosphere and names of things ; admirably , thoroughly alive , and with whole records of conscious experience in obscure , shadowy fields of living and feeling which most of us pass over without knowing they exist .
poor young devil if only his father had lived longer and taken him in hand !
there was great stuff in the boy !
i was glad of the visit , for i felt it would help to set up a normal atmosphere in the house again .
and that what it really seemed to do at first ; for as i said , marsh was a delight to have around .
he was as sincere and profound an artist as i ever saw in my life , and i certainly believe that nothing on earth mattered to him except the perception and expression of beauty .
when he saw an exquisite thing , or was creating one , his eyes would dilate until the light irises were nearly out of sight leaving two mystical black pits in that weak , delicate , face ; black pits opening on strange worlds which none of us could guess about .
when he reached here , though , he did have many chances to shew this tendency ; for he had , as he told denis , gone quite stale .
it seems he had been very successful as an artist of a bizarre kind like fuseli or goya or sime or clark ashton smith but had suddenly become played out .
the world of ordinary things around him had ceased to hold anything he could recognize as beauty beauty , that is , of enough force and poignancy to arouse his creative faculty .
he had often been this way before all decadents are but this time he could not invent any new , strange , or outré sensation or experience which would supply the needed illusion of fresh beauty or stimulatingly adventurous expectancy .
he was like a durtal or a des esseintes at the most jaded point of his curious orbit .
marceline was away when marsh arrived .
she had been enthusiastic about his coming , and had refused to decline an invitation from some of our friends in louis which came about that time for her and denis .
denis , of course , stayed to receive his guest ; but marceline had gone on alone .
it was the first time they had ever been separated , and i hoped the interval would help to dispel the daze that was making such a fool of the boy .
marceline shewed no hurry to get back , but seemed to me to prolong her absence as much as she could .
denis stood it better than one would have expected from such a doting husband , and seemed more like his old self as he talked over other days with marsh and tried to cheer the listless aesthete up .
it was marsh who seemed most impatient to see the woman ; perhaps because he thought her strange beauty , or some phase of the mysticism which had gone into her magical cult , might help to reawaken his interest in things and give him another start toward artistic creation .
that there was no baser reason , i was absolutely certain from what i knew of marsh character .
with all his weaknesses , he was a gentleman and it had indeed relieved me when i first learned that he wanted to come here because his willingness to accept denis ' hospitality proved that there was no reason why he should .
when , at last , marceline did return , i could see that marsh was tremendously affected .
he did not attempt to make her talk of the bizarre thing which she had so definitely abandoned , but was unable to hide a powerful admiration which kept his eyes now dilated in that curious way for the first time during his visit riveted to her every moment she was in the room .
she , however , seemed uneasy rather than pleased by his steady scrutiny that is , she seemed so at first , though this feeling of hers wore away in a few days , and left the two on a basis of the most cordial and voluble congeniality .
i could see marsh studying her constantly when he thought no one was watching ; and i wondered how long it would be that only the artist , and not the primitive man , would be aroused by her mysterious graces .
denis naturally felt some irritation at this turn of affairs ; though he realised that his guest was a man of honour and that , as kindred mystics and aesthetes , marceline and marsh would naturally have things and interests to discuss in which a more or less conventional person could have no part .
he did hold anything against anybody , but merely regretted that his own imagination was too limited and traditional to let him talk with marceline as marsh talked .
at this stage of things i began to see more of the boy .
with his wife otherwise busy , he had time to remember that he had a father and a father who was ready to help him in any sort of perplexity or difficulty .
we often sat together on the veranda watching marsh and marceline as they rode up or down the drive on horseback , or played tennis on the court that used to stretch south of the house .
they talked mostly in french , which marsh , though he had more than a of french blood , handled more glibly than either denis or i could speak it .
marceline english , always academically correct , was rapidly improving in accent ; but it was plain that she relished dropping back into her .
as we looked at the congenial couple they made , i could see the boy cheek and throat muscles tighten though he was a whit less ideal a host to marsh , or a whit less considerate husband to marceline .
all this was generally in the afternoon ; for marceline rose very late , had breakfast in bed , and took an immense amount of time preparing to come downstairs .
i never knew of anyone so wrapped up in cosmetics , beauty exercises , , unguents , and everything of that kind .
it was in these morning hours that denis and marsh did their real visiting , and exchanged the close confidences which kept their friendship up despite the strain that jealousy imposed .
well , it was in one of those morning talks on the veranda that marsh made the proposition which brought on the end .
i was laid up with some of my neuritis , but had managed to get downstairs and stretch out on the front parlour sofa near the long window .
denis and marsh were just outside ; so i could help hearing all they said .
they had been talking about art , and the curious , capricious elements needed to jolt an artist into producing the real article , when marsh suddenly swerved from abstractions to the personal application he must have had in mind from the start .
' i suppose , ' he was saying , nobody can tell just what it is in some scenes or objects that makes them aesthetic stimuli for certain individuals .
basically , of course , it must have some reference to each man background of mental associations , for no two people have the same scale of sensitiveness and responses .
we decadents are artists for whom all ordinary things have ceased to have any emotional or imaginative significance , but no one of us responds in the same way to exactly the same extraordinary .
now take me , for instance . '
he paused and resumed .
' i know , denny , that i can say these things to you because you such a preternaturally unspoiled mind clean , fine , direct , objective , and all that .
you wo misunderstand as an oversubtilised , effete man of the world might . '
he paused once more .
fact is , i think i know what needed to set my imagination working again .
i had a dim idea of it ever since we were in paris , but i sure now .
it marceline , old chap that face and that hair , and the train of shadowy images they bring up .
not merely visible beauty though god knows there enough of that but something peculiar and individualised , that ca exactly be explained .
do you know , in the last few days i felt the existence of such a stimulus so keenly that i honestly think i could outdo myself break into the real masterpiece class if i could get ahold of paint and canvas at just the time when her face and hair set my fancy stirring and weaving .
there something weird and about it something joined up with the dim ancient thing marceline represents .
i do know how much she told you about that side of her , but i can assure you there plenty of it .
she has some marvellous links with the outside . '
some change in denis ' expression must have halted the speaker here , for there was a considerable spell of silence before the words went on .
i was utterly taken aback , for i expected no such overt development like this ; and i wondered what my son could be thinking .
my heart began to pound violently , and i strained my ears in the frankest of intentional eavesdropping .
then marsh resumed .
course you jealous i know how a speech like mine must sound but i can swear to you that you need be . '
denis did not answer , and marsh went '
to tell the truth , i could never be in love with marceline i could even be a cordial friend of hers in the warmest sense .
why , damn it all , i felt like a hypocrite talking with her these days as i been doing .
case simply is , that one of her phase of her half hyponotises me in a certain way a very strange , fantastic , and dimly terrible way just as another phase half hypnotises you in a much more normal way .
i see something in her or to be psychologically exact , something through her or beyond her that you did see at all .
something that brings up a vast pageantry of shapes from forgotten abysses , and makes me want to paint incredible things whose outlines vanish the instant i try to envisage them clearly .
do mistake , denny , your wife is a magnificent being , a splendid focus of cosmic forces who has a right to be called divine if anything on earth has ! '
i felt a clearing of the situation at this point , for the abstract strangeness of marsh statement , plus the flattery he was now heaping on marceline , could not fail to disarm and mollify one as fondly proud of his consort as denis always was .
marsh evidently caught the change himself , for there was more confidence in his tone as he continued .
' i must paint her , denny must paint that hair and you wo regret .
there something more than mortal about that hair something more than beautiful ' he paused , and i wondered what denis could be thinking .
i wondered , indeed , what i was really thinking myself .
was marsh interest actually that of the artist alone , or was he merely infatuated as denis had been ?
i had thought , in their schooldays , that he had envied my boy ; and i dimly felt that it might be the same now .
on the other hand , something in that talk of artistic stimulus had rung amazingly true ; so that the more i pondered , the more i was inclined to take the stuff at face value .
denis seemed to do so , too , for although i could not catch his reply , i could tell by the effect it produced that it must have been affirmative .
there was a sound of someone slapping another on the back , and then a grateful speech from marsh that i was long to remember .
great , denny , and just as i told you , you never regret it .
in a sense , i half doing it for you .
you be a different man when you see it .
i put you back where you used to be give you a and a sort of salvation but you ca see what i mean as yet .
just remember old friendship , and do get the idea that i not the same old bird ! '
i rose perplexedly as i saw the two stroll off across the lawn , arm in arm , and smoking in unison .
what could marsh have meant by his strange and almost ominous reassurance ?
the more my fears were quieted in one direction , the more they were aroused in another .
look at it any way i could , it seemed to be a rather bad business .
but matters got started just the same .
denis fixed up an attic room with skylights , and marsh sent for all sorts of painting equipment .
everyone was rather excited about the new venture , and i was at least glad that something was on foot to break the brooding tension .
soon the sittings began , and we all took them quite seriously for we could see that marsh regarded them as important artistic events .
denny and i used to go quietly about the house as though something sacred were occurring , and we knew that it was sacred as far as marsh was concerned .
with marceline , though , it was a different matter , as i began to see at once .
whatever marsh reactions to the sittings may have been , hers were painfully obvious .
every possible way she betrayed a frank and commonplace infatuation for the artist , and would repulse denis ' marks of affection whenever she dared .
oddly , i noticed this more vividly than denis himself , and tried to devise some plan for keeping the boy mind easy until the matter could be straightened out .
there was no use in having him excited about it if it could be helped .
in the end i decided that denis had better be away while the disagreeable situation existed .
i could represent his interests well enough at this end , and sooner or later marsh would finish the picture and go .
my view of marsh honour was such that i did not look for any worse developments .
when the matter had blown over , and marceline had forgotten about her new infatuation , it would be time enough to have denis on hand again .
so i wrote a long letter to my marketing and financial agent in new york , and cooked up a plan to have the boy summoned there for an indefinite time .
i had the agent write him that our affairs absolutely required one of us to go east , and of course my illness made it clear that i could not be the one .
it was arranged that when denis got to new york he would find enough plausible matters to keep him busy as long as i thought he ought to be away .
the plan worked perfectly , and denis started for new york without the least suspicion ; marceline and marsh going with him in the car to cape girardeau , where he caught the afternoon train to louis .
they returned after dark , and as mccabe drove the car back to the stables i could hear them talking on the veranda in those same chairs near the long parlour window where marsh and denis had sat when i overheard them talk about the portrait .
this time i resolved to do some intentional eavesdropping , so quietly went down to the front parlour and stretched out on the sofa near the window .
at first i could not hear anything but very shortly there came the sound of a chair being shifted , followed by a short , sharp breath and a sort of inarticulately hurt exclamation from marceline .
then i heard marsh speaking in a strained , almost formal voice .
' i enjoy working tonight if you are too tired . '
marceline reply was in the same hurt tone which had marked her exclamation .
she used english as he had done .
, frank , is that really all you care about ?
forever working !
ca we just sit out here in this glorious moonlight ? '
he answered impatiently , his voice shewing a certain contempt beneath the dominant quality of artistic enthusiasm .
!
good god , what cheap sentimentality !
for a supposedly sophisticated person you surely do hang on to some of the crudest claptrap that ever escaped from the dime novels !
with art at your elbow , you have to think of the moon cheap as a spotlight at the varieties !
or perhaps it makes you think of the roodmas dance around the stone pillars at auteiul .
hell , how you used to make those yaps stare !
but not i suppose you dropped all that now .
no more atlantean magic or rites for madame de russy !
i the only one to remember the ld things the things that came down through the temples of tanit and echoed on the ramparts of zimbabwe .
but i wo be cheated of that remembrance all that is weaving itself into the thing on my canvas the thing that is going to capture wonder and crystallise the secrets of years . '
marceline interrupted in a voice full of mixed emotions .
you who are cheaply sentimental now !
you know well that the old things had better be let alone .
all of you had better watch out if ever i chant the old rites or try to call up what lies hidden in yuggoth , zimbabwe , and .
i thought you had more sense !
lack logic .
you want me to be interested in this precious painting of yours , yet you never let me see what you doing .
always that black cloth over it !
it of me i should think it would matter if i saw it . '
marsh was interrupting this time , his voice curiously hard and strained .
.
not now .
you see it in due course of time .
you say it of you yes , it that , but it more .
if you knew , you might be so impatient .
poor denis !
my god , it a shame ! '
my throat was suddenly dry as the words rose to an almost febrile pitch .
what could marsh mean ?
suddenly i saw that he had stopped and was entering the house alone .
i heard the front door slam , and listened as his footsteps ascended the stairs .
outside on the veranda i could still hear marceline heavy , angry breathing .
i crept away sick at heart , feeling that there were grave things to ferret out before i could safely let denis come back .
after that evening the tension around the place was even worse than before .
marceline had always lived on flattery and fawning and the shock of those few blunt words from marsh was too much for her temperament .
there was no living in the house with her anymore , for with poor denis gone she took out her abusiveness on everybody .
when she could find no one indoors to quarrel with she would go out to sophonisba cabin and spend hours talking with the queer old zulu woman .
aunt sophy was the only person who would fawn abjectly enough to suit her , and when i tried once to overhear their conversation i found marceline whispering about secrets ' and kadath ' while the negress rocked to and fro in her chair , making inarticulate sounds of reverence and admiration every now and then .
but nothing could break her infatuation for marsh .
she would talk bitterly and sullenly to him , yet was getting more and more obedient to his wishes .
it was very convenient for him , since he now became able to make her pose for the picture whenever he felt like painting .
he tried to shew gratitude for this willingness , but i thought i could detect a kind of contempt or even loathing beneath his careful politeness .
for my part , i frankly hated marceline !
there was no use in calling my attitude anything as mild as dislike these days .
certainly , i was glad denis was away .
his letters , not nearly so frequent as i wished , shewed signs of strain and worry .
as the middle of august went by i gathered from marsh remarks that the portrait was nearly done .
his mood seemed increasingly sardonic , though marceline temper improved a bit as the prospect of seeing the thing tickled her vanity .
i can still recall the day when marsh said he have everything finished within a week .
marceline brightened up perceptibly , though not without a venomous look at me .
it seemed as if her coiled hair visibly tightened around her head .
' i to be the first to see it ! '
she snapped .
then , smiling at marsh , she said , if i do like it i shall slash it to pieces ! '
marsh face took on the most curious look i have ever seen it wear as he answered her .
' i ca vouch for your taste , marceline , but i swear it will be magnificent !
not that i want to take much credit art creates itself and this thing had to be done .
just wait ! '
during the next few days i felt a queer sense of foreboding , as if the completion of the picture meant a kind of catastrophe instead of a relief .
denis , too , had not written me , and my agent in new york said he was planning some trip to the country .
i wondered what the outcome of the whole thing would be .
what a queer mixture of elements marsh and marceline , denis and i !
how would all these ultimately react on one another ?
when my fears grew too great i tried to lay them all to my infirmity , but that explanation never quite satisfied me .
well , the thing exploded on tuesday , the of august .
i had risen at my usual time and had breakfast , but was not good for much because of the pain in my spine .
it had been troubling me badly of late , and forcing me to take opiates when it got too unbearable ; nobody else was downstairs except the servants , though i could hear marceline moving about in her room .
marsh slept in the attic next his studio , and had begun to keep such late hours that he was seldom up till noon .
about ten the pain got the better of me , so that i took a double dose of my opiate and lay down on the parlour sofa .
the last i heard was marceline pacing overhead .
poor creature if i had known !
she must have been walking before the long mirror admiring herself .
that was like her .
vain from start to finish revelling in her own beauty , just as she revelled in all the little luxuries denis was able to give her .
i did wake up till near sunset , and knew instantly how long i had slept from the golden light and long shadows outside the long window .
nobody was about , and a sort of unnatural stillness seemed to be hovering over everything .
from afar , though , i thought i could sense a faint howling , wild and intermittent , whose quality had a slight but baffling familiarity about it .
i not much for psychic premonitions , but i was frightfully uneasy from the start .
there had been dreams even worse than the ones i had been dreaming in the weeks before and this time they seemed hideously linked to some black and festering reality .
the whole place had a poisonous air .
afterward i reflected that certain sounds must have filtered through into my unconscious brain during those hours of drugged sleep .
my pain , though , was very much eased ; and i rose and walked without difficulty .
soon enough i began to see that something was wrong .
marsh and marceline might have been riding , but someone ought to have been getting dinner in the kitchen .
instead , there was only silence , except for that faint , distant howl or wail ; and nobody answered when i pulled the to summon scipio .
then , chancing to look up , i saw the spreading stain on the ceiling the bright red stain , that must have come through the floor of marceline room .
in an instant i forgot my crippled back and hurried upstairs to find out the worst .
everything under the sun raced through my mind as i struggled with the door of that silent chamber , and most hideous of all was a terrible sense of malign fulfilment and fatal expectedness .
i had , it struck me , known all along that nameless horrors were gathering ; that something profoundly and cosmically evil had gained a under my roof from which only blood and tragedy could result .
the door gave at last , and i stumbled into the large room beyond all dim from the branches of the great trees outside the windows .
for a moment i could do nothing but flinch at the faint evil odour that immediately struck my nostrils .
then , turning on the electric light and glancing around , i glimpsed a nameless blasphemy on the yellow and blue rug .
it lay face down in a great pool of dark , thickened blood , and had the gory print of a shod human foot in the middle of its naked back .
blood was spattered everywhere on the walls , furniture , and floor .
my knees gave way as i took in the sight , so that i had to stumble to a chair and slump down .
the thing had obviously been a human being , though its identity was not easy to establish at first ; since it was without clothes , and had most of its hair hacked and torn from the scalp in a very crude way .
it was of a deep ivory colour , and i knew that it must have been marceline .
the on the back made the thing seem all the more hellish .
i could not even picture the strange , loathsome tragedy which must have taken place while i slept in the room below .
when i raised my hand to wipe my dripping forehead i saw that my fingers were sticky with blood .
i shuddered , then realised that it must have come from the knob of the door which the unknown murderer had forced shut behind him as he left .
he had taken his weapon with him , it seemed , for no instrument of death was visible here .
as i studied the floor i saw that a line of sticky footprints like the one on the body led away from the horror to the door .
there was another , too , and of a less easily explainable kind ; a broadish , continuous line , as if marking the path of some huge snake .
at first i concluded it must be due to something the murderer had dragged after him .
then , noting the way some of the footprints seemed to be superimposed on it , i was forced to believe that it could have been there when the murderer left .
but what crawling entity could have been in that room with the victim and her assassin , leaving before the killer when the deed was done ?
as i asked myself this question i thought i heard fresh bursts of that faint , distant wailing .
finally , rousing myself from a lethargy of horror , i got on my feet again and began following the footprints .
who the murderer was , i could not even faintly guess , nor could i try to explain the absence of the servants .
i vaguely felt that i ought to go up to marsh attic quarters , but before i had fully formulated the idea i saw that the bloody trail was indeed taking me there .
was he himself the murderer ?
had he gone mad under the strain of the morbid situation and suddenly run amok ?
in the attic corridor the trail became faint , the prints almost ceasing as they merged with the dark carpet .
i could still , however , discern the strange single path of the entity who had gone first ; and this led straight to the closed door of marsh studio , disappearing beneath it at a point about half way from side to side .
evidently it had crossed the threshold at a time when the door was wide open .
sick at heart , i tried the knob and found the door unlocked .
opening it , i paused in the waning north light to see what fresh nightmare might be awaiting me .
there was certainly something human on the floor , and i reached for the switch to turn on the chandelier .
but as the light flashed up my gaze left the floor and its horror that was marsh , poor devil to fix itself frantically and incredulously upon the living thing that cowered and stared in the open doorway leading to marsh bedroom .
it was a tousled , thing , crusted with dried blood and carrying in its hand a wicked machete which had been one of the ornaments of the studio wall .
yet even in that awful moment i recognised it as one whom i had thought more than a thousand miles away .
it was my own boy denis or the maddened wreck which had once been denis .
the sight of me seemed to bring back a trifle of sanity or at least of memory in the poor boy .
he straightened up and began to toss his head about as if trying to shake free from some enveloping influence .
i could not speak a word , but moved my lips in an effort to get back my voice .
my eyes wandered for a moment to the figure on the floor in front of the heavily draped easel the figure toward which the strange led , and which seemed to be tangled in the coils of some dark , ropy object .
the shifting of my glance apparently produced some impression in the twisted brain of the boy , for suddenly he began to mutter in a hoarse whisper whose purport i was soon able to catch .
' i had to exterminate her she was the devil the summit and of all evil the spawn of the pit marsh knew , and tried to warn me .
good old frank i did kill him , though i was ready to before i realised .
but i went down there and killed her then that cursed hair ' i listened in horror as denis choked , paused , and began again .
did know her letters got queer and i knew she was in love with marsh .
then she nearly stopped writing .
he never mentioned her i felt something was wrong , and thought i ought to come back and find out .
could tell you your manner would have given it away .
wanted to surprise them .
got here about noon today came in a cab and sent the all off let the field hands alone , for their cabins are all out of earshot .
told mccabe to get me some things in cape girardeau and not bother to come back until tomorrow .
had all the niggers take the old car and let mary drive them to bend village for a vacation told we were all going on some sort of outing and would need help .
said they better stay all night with uncle scip cousin , who keeps that nigger boarding house . '
denis was getting very incoherent now , and i strained my ears to grasp every word .
again i thought i heard that wild , wail , but the story had first place for the present .
you sleeping in the parlour , and took a chance you would wake up .
then went upstairs on the quiet to hunt up marsh and that woman ! '
the boy shuddered as he avoided pronouncing marceline name .
at the same time i saw his eyes dilate in unison with a bursting of the distant crying , whose vague familiarity had now become very great .
was not in her room , so i went up to the studio .
door was shut , and i could hear voices inside .
did knock just burst in and found her posing for the picture .
nude , but with the hellish hair all draped around her .
and making all sorts of sheep eyes at marsh .
he had the easel turned half away from the door , so i could see the picture .
both of them were pretty well jolted when i shewed up , and marsh dropped his brush .
i was in a rage and told him he have to shew me the portrait , but he got calmer every minute .
told me it was quite done , but would be in a day or two said i could see it then she had seen it .
that did go with me .
i stepped up , and he dropped a velvet curtain over the thing before i could see it .
he was ready to fight before letting me see it , but that that she stepped up and sided with me .
said we ought to see it .
frank got horrible worked up , and gave me a punch when i tried to get at the curtain .
i punched back and seemed to have knocked him out .
then i was almost knocked out myself by the shriek that that creature gave .
she drawn aside the hangings herself , and caught a look at what marsh had been painting .
i wheeled around and saw her rushing like mad out of the room then i saw the picture . '
madness flared up in the boy eyes again as he got to this place , and i thought for a minute he was going to spring at me with his machete .
but after a pause he partly steadied himself .
, god that thing !
do ever look at it !
burn it with the hangings around it and throw the ashes into the river !
marsh knew and was warning me .
he knew what it was what that woman that leopardess , or gorgon , or lamia , or whatever she was actually represented .
he tried to hint to me ever since i met her in his paris studio , but it could be told in words .
i thought they all wronged her when they whispered horrors about her she had me hypnotised so that i could believe the plain facts but this picture has caught the whole secret the whole monstrous background !
, but frank is an artist !
that thing is the greatest piece any living soul has produced since rembrandt !
it a crime to burn it but it would be a greater crime to let it exist just as it would have been an abhorrent sin to let that exist any longer .
the minute i saw it i understood what she was , and what part she played in the frightful secret that has come down from the days of cthulhu and the elder ones the secret that was nearly wiped out when atlantis sank , but that kept half alive in hidden traditions and allegorical myths and furtive , midnight .
for you know she was the real thing .
it was any fake .
it would have been merciful if it had been a fake .
it was the old , hideous shadow that philosophers never dared mention the thing hinted at in the necronomicon and symbolised in the easter island colossi .
thought we could see through that the false front would hold till we had bartered away our immortal souls .
and she was half right she have got me in the end .
she was only waiting .
but frank good old frank was too much for me .
he knew what it all meant , and painted it .
i do wonder she shrieked and ran off when she saw it .
it was quite done , but god knows enough was there .
i knew i got to kill her kill her , and everything connected with her .
it was a taint that wholesome human blood could bear .
there was something else , too but you never know that if you burn the picture without looking .
i staggered down to her room with this machete that i got off the wall here , leaving frank still knocked out .
he was breathing , though , and i knew and thanked heaven i had killed him .
' i found her in front of the mirror braiding that accursed hair .
she turned on me like a wild beast , and began spitting out her hatred of marsh .
the fact that she been in love with him and i knew she had only made it worse .
for a minute i could move , and she came within an ace of completely hypnotising me .
then i thought of the picture , and the spell broke .
she saw the breaking in my eyes , and must have noticed the machete , too .
i never saw anything give such a wild jungle beast look as she did then .
she sprang for me with claws out like a leopard , but i was too quick .
i swung the machete , and it was all over . '
denis had to stop again , and i saw the perspiration running down his forehead through the spattered blood .
but in a moment he hoarsely resumed .
' i said it was all over but god !
some of it had only just begun !
i felt i had fought the legions of satan , and put my foot on the back of the thing i had annihilated .
then i saw that blasphemous braid of coarse black hair begin to twist and squirm of itself .
' i might have known it .
it was all in the old tales .
that damnable hair had a life of its own , that could be ended by killing the creature itself .
i knew i have to burn it , so i started to hack it off with the machete .
god , but it was devilish work !
tough like iron wires but i managed to do it .
and it was loathsome the way the big braid writhed and struggled in my grasp .
the time i had the last strand cut or pulled off i heard that eldritch wailing from behind the house .
you know it still going off and on .
i do know what it is , but it must be something springing from this hellish business .
it half seems like something i ought to know but ca quite place .
it got my nerves the first time i heard it , and i dropped the severed braid in my fright .
then , i got a worse fright for in another second the braid had turned on me and began to strike venomously with one of its ends which had knotted itself up like a sort of grotesque head .
i struck out with the machete , and it turned away .
then , when i had my breath again , i saw that the monstrous thing was crawling along the floor by itself like a great black snake .
i could do anything for a while , but when it vanished through the door i managed to pull myself together and stumble after it .
i could follow the broad , bloody trail , and i saw it led upstairs .
it brought me here and may heaven curse me if i did see it through the doorway , striking at poor dazed marsh like a maddened rattler as it had struck at me , finally coiling around him as a python would .
he had begun to come to , but that abominable serpent got him before he was on his feet .
i knew that all of the woman hatred was behind it , but i had the power to pull it off .
i tried , but it was too much for me .
even the machete was no good i could swing it freely or it would have slashed frank to pieces .
so i saw those monstrous coils tighten saw poor frank crushed to death before my eyes and all the time that awful faint howling came from somewhere beyond the fields .
all .
i pulled the velvet cloth over the picture and hope it never be lifted .
the thing must be burnt .
i could pry the coils off poor , dead frank they cling to him like a leech , and seem to have lost their motion altogether .
it as if that snaky rope of hair has a kind of perverse fondness for the man it killed it clinging to him embracing him .
you have to burn poor frank with it but for god sake do forget to see it in ashes .
that and the picture .
they must both go .
the safety of the world demands that they go .
denis might have whispered more , but a fresh burst of distant wailing cut us short .
for the first time we knew what it was , for a westerly veering wind brought articulate words at last .
we ought to have known long before , since sounds much like it had often come from the same source .
it was wrinkled sophonisba , the ancient zulu who had fawned on marceline , keening from her cabin in a way which crowned the horrors of this nightmare tragedy .
we could both hear some of the things she howled , and knew that secret and primordial bonds linked this savage sorceress with that other inheritor of elder secrets who had just been extirpated .
some of the words she used betrayed her closeness to daemonic and palaeogean traditions .
!
iä !
!
!
bwana !
ya , yo , poor missy tanit , poor missy isis !
marse clooloo , come up outen de water an ' git yo chile she done daid !
she done daid !
de hair ain ' got no missus no mo ' , marse clooloo .

no mo ' tanit !
no mo ' isis !
no mo ' to keep de fire ' in de big stone place !
ya , yo !
bwana !
iä !
!
she daid !
ol ' sophy know ! '
that was the end of the wailing , but it was all i could pay attention to .
the expression on my boy face shewed that it had reminded him of something frightful , and the tightening of his hand on the machete boded no good .
i knew he was desperate , and sprang to disarm him before he could do anything more .
but i was too late .
an old man with a bad spine does count for much physically .
there was a terrible struggle , but he had done for himself before many seconds were over .
i not sure yet but that he tried to kill me , too .
his last panting words were something about the need of wiping out everything that had been connected with marceline , either by blood or marriage .
i wonder to this day that i did go stark mad in that instant or in the moments and hours afterward .
in front of me was the slain body of my boy the only human being i had to cherish and ten feet away , in front of that shrouded easel , was the body of his best friend , with a nameless coil of horror wound around it .
below was the scalped corpse of that , about whom i was to believe anything .
i was too dazed to analyse the probability of the hair story and even if i had not been , that dismal howling coming from aunt sophy cabin would have been enough to quiet doubt for the nonce .
if i been wise , i have done just what poor denis told me to burned the picture and the hair at once and without curiosity but i was too shaken to be wise .
i suppose i muttered foolish things over my boy and then i remembered that the night was wearing on and that the servants would be back in the morning .
it was plain that a matter like this could never be explained , and i knew that i must cover things up and invent a story .
that coil of hair around marsh was a monstrous thing .
as i poked at it with a sword which i took from the wall i almost thought i felt it tighten its grip on the dead man .
i did dare touch it and the longer i looked at it the more horrible things i noticed about it .
one thing gave me a start .
i wo mention it but it partly explained the need for feeding the hair with queer oils as marceline had always done .
in the end i decided to bury all three bodies in the cellar with quicklime , which i knew we had in the storehouse .
it was a night of hellish work .
i dug three graves my boy a long way from the other two , for i did want him to be near either the woman body or her hair .
i was sorry i could get the coil from around poor marsh .
it was terrible work getting them all down to the cellar .
i used blankets in carting the woman and the poor devil with the coil around him .
then i had to get two barrels of lime from the storehouse .
god must have given me strength , for i not only moved them but filled all three graves without a hitch .
some of the lime i made into whitewash .
i had to take a stepladder and fix over the parlour ceiling where the blood had oozed through .
and i burned nearly everything in marceline room , scrubbing the walls and floor and heavy furniture .
i washed up the attic studio , too , and the trail and footprints that led there .
and all the time i could hear old sophy wailing in the distance .
the devil must have been in that creature to let her voice go on like that .
but she always was howling queer things .
that why the field niggers did get scared or curious that night .
i locked the studio door and took the key to my room .
then i burned all my stained clothes in the fireplace .
by dawn the whole house looked quite normal so far as any casual eye could tell .
i had dared touch the covered easel , but meant to attend to that later .
well , the servants came back the next day , and i told them all the young folks had gone to louis .
none of the field hands seemed to have seen or heard anything , and old sophonisba wailing had stopped at the instant of sunrise .
she was like a sphinx after that , and never let out a word of what had been on her brooding brain the day and night before .
later on i pretended that denis and marsh and marceline had gone back to paris and had a certain discreet agency mail me letters from there letters i had fixed up in forged handwriting .
it took a good deal of deceit and reticence in several things to various friends , and i knew people have secretly suspected me of holding something back .
i had the deaths of marsh and denis reported during the war , and later said marceline had entered a convent .
fortunately marsh was an orphan whose eccentric ways had alienated him from his people in louisiana .
things might have been patched up a good deal better for me if i had had the sense to burn the picture , sell the plantation , and give up trying to manage things with a shaken and overstrained mind .
you see what my folly has brought me to .
failing crops hands discharged one by one place falling apart to ruin and myself a hermit and a target for dozens of queer countryside stories .
nobody will come around here after dark anymore or any other time if it can be helped .
that why i knew you must be a stranger .
and why do i stay here ?
i ca wholly tell you that .
it bound up too closely with things at the very rim of sane reality .
it would have been so , perhaps , if i had looked at the picture .
i ought to have done as poor denis told me .
i honestly meant to burn it when i went up to that locked studio a week after the horror , but i looked first and that changed everything .
no there no use telling what i saw .
you can , in a way , see for yourself presently ; though time and dampness have done their work .
i do think it can hurt you if you want to take a look , but it was different with me .
i knew too much of what it all meant .
denis had been right it was the greatest triumph of human art since rembrandt , even though still unfinished .
i grasped that at the start , and knew that poor marsh had justified his decadent philosophy .
he was to painting what baudelaire was to poetry and marceline was the key that had unlocked his inmost stronghold of genius .
the thing almost stunned me when i pulled aside the hangings stunned me before i half knew what the whole thing was .
you know , it only partly a portrait .
marsh had been pretty literal when he hinted that he was painting marceline alone , but what he saw through her and beyond her .
of course she was in it was the key to it , in a sense but her figure only formed one point in a vast composition .
she was nude except for that hideous web of hair spun around her , and was , on a sort of bench or divan , carved in patterns unlike those of any known decorative tradition .
there was a monstrously shaped goblet in one hand , from which was spilling fluid whose colour i have been able to place or classify to this day i do know where marsh even got the pigments .
the figure and the divan were in the foreground of the strangest sort of scene i ever saw in my life .
i think there was a faint suggestion of its all being a kind of emanation from the woman brain , yet there was also a directly opposite suggestion as if she were just an evil image or hallucination conjured up by the scene itself .
i ca tell you know whether it an exterior or an interior whether those hellish cyclopean vaultings are seen from the outside or the inside , or whether they are indeed carven stone and not merely a morbid fungous arborescence .
the geometry of the whole thing is crazy one gets the acute and obtuse angles all mixed up .
and god !
the shapes of nightmare that float around in that perpetual daemon twilight !
the blasphemies that lurk and leer and hold a witches ' sabbat with that woman as a !
the black shaggy entities that are not quite goats the beast with three legs and a dorsal row of tentacles and the egyptians dancing in a pattern that egypt priests knew and called accursed !
but the scene was egypt it was behind egypt ; behind even atlantis ; behind fabled mu , and myth whispered lemuria .
it was the ultimate fountainhead of all horror on this earth , and the symbolism shewed only too clearly how integral a part of it marceline was .
i think it must be the unmentionable , that was not built by any creatures of this planet the thing marsh and denis used to talk about in the shadows with hushed voices .
in the picture it appears that the whole scene is deep under water though everybody seems to be breathing freely .
well i could do anything but look and shudder , and finally i saw that marceline was watching me craftily out of those monstrous , dilated eyes on the canvas .
it was no mere superstition marsh had actually caught something of her horrible vitality in his symphonies of line and color , so that she still brooded and hated , just as if most of her were down in the cellar under quicklime .
and it was worst of all when some of those snaky strands of hair began to lift themselves up from the surface and grope out into the room toward me .
then it was that i knew the last final horror , and realised i was a guardian and a prisoner forever .
she was the thing from which the first dim legends of medusa and the gorgons had sprung , and something in my shaken will had been captured and turned to stone at last .
never again would i be safe from those coiling snaky strands the strands in the picture , and those that lay brooding under the lime near the wine casks .
all too late i recalled the tales of the virtual indestructibility , even through centuries of burial , of the hair of the dead .
my life since has been nothing but horror and slavery .
always there had lurked the fear of what broods down in the cellar .
in less than a month the niggers began whispering about the great black snake that crawled around near the wine casks after dark , and about the curious way its trail would lead to another spot six feet away .
finally i had to move everything to another part of the cellar , for not a darky could be induced to go near the place where the snake was seen .
then the field hands began talking about the black snake that visited old sophonisba cabin every night after midnight .
one of them shewed me its trail and not long afterward i found out that aunt sophy herself had begun to pay strange visits to the cellar of the big house , lingering and muttering for hours in the very spot where none of the other blacks would go near .
god , but i was glad when that old witch died !
i honestly believe she had been a priestess of some ancient and terrible tradition back in africa .
she must have lived to be almost a hundred and fifty years old .
sometimes i think i hear something gliding around the house at night .
there will be a queer noise on the stairs , where the boards are loose , and the latch of my room will rattle as if with an inward pressure .
i always keep my door locked , of course .
then there are certain mornings when i seem to catch a sickish musty odour in the corridors , and notice a faint , ropy trail through the dust of the floors .
i know i must guard the hair in the picture , for if anything were to happen to it , there are entities in this house which would take a sure and terrible revenge .
i do even dare to die for life and death are all one to those in the clutch of what came out of .
something would be on hand to punish my neglect .
medusa coil has got me , and it will always be the same .
never mix up with secret and ultimate horror , young man , if you value your immortal soul .
as the old man finished his story i saw that the small lamp had long since burned dry , and that the large one was nearly empty .
it must , i knew , be near dawn , and my ears told me that the storm was over .
the tale had held me in a , and i almost feared to glance at the door lest it reveal an inward pressure from some unnamable source .
it would be hard to say which had the greatest hold on me stark horror , incredulity , or a kind of morbid fantastic curiosity .
i was wholly beyond speech and had to wait for my strange host to break the spell .
do you want to see the thing ?
his voice was low and hesitant , and i saw he was tremendously in earnest .
of my various emotions , curiosity gained the upper hand ; and i nodded silently .
he rose , lighting a candle on a nearby table and holding it high before him as he opened the door .
come with me upstairs .
i dreaded to brave those musty corridors again , but fascination downed all my qualms .
the boards creaked beneath our feet , and i trembled once when i thought i saw a faint , line trace in the dust near the staircase .
the steps of the attic were noisy and rickety , with several of the treads missing .
i was just glad of the need of looking sharply to my footing , for it gave me an excuse not to glance about .
the attic corridor was and heavily cobwebbed , and with dust except where a beaten trail led to a door on the left at the farther end .
as i noticed the rotting remains of a thick carpet i thought of the other feet which had pressed it in bygone decades of these , and of one thing which did not have feet .
the old man took me straight to the door at the end of the beaten path , and fumbled a second with the rusty latch .
i was acutely frightened now that i knew the picture was so close , yet dared not retreat at this stage .
in another moment my host was ushering me into the deserted studio .
the candle light was very faint , yet served to shew most of the principal features .
i noticed the low , slanting roof , the huge enlarged dormer , the curios and trophies hung on the wall and most of all , the great shrouded easel in the centre of the floor .
to that easel de russy now walked , drawing aside the dusty velvet hangings on the side turned away from me , and motioning me silently to approach .
it took a good deal of courage to make me obey , especially when i saw how my guide eyes dilated in the wavering candle light as he looked at the unveiled canvas .
but again curiosity conquered everything , and i walked around to where de russy stood .
then i saw the damnable thing .
i did not faint though no reader can possibly realise the effort it took to keep me from doing so .
i did cry out , but stopped short when i saw the frightened look on the old man face .
as i had expected , the canvas was warped , mouldy , and scabrous from dampness and neglect ; but for all that i could trace the monstrous hints of evil cosmic outsideness that lurked all through the nameless scene morbid content and perverted geometry .
it was as the old man had said a vaulted , columned hell of mumbled black masses and witches ' sabbaths and what perfect completion could have added to it was beyond my power to guess .
decay had only increased the utter hideousness of its wicked symbolism and diseased suggestion , for the parts most affected by time were just those parts of the picture which in nature or in the realm that mocked nature would be apt to decay and disintegrate .
the utmost horror of all , of course , was marceline and as i saw the bloated , discoloured flesh i formed the odd fancy that perhaps the figure on the canvas had some obscure , occult linkage with the figure which lay in quicklime under the cellar floor .
perhaps the lime had preserved the corpse instead of destroying it but could it have preserved those black , malign eyes that glared and mocked at me from their painted hell ?
and there was something else about the creature which i could not fail to notice something which de russy had not been able to put into words , but which perhaps had something to do with denis ' wish to kill all those of his blood who had dwelt under the same roof with her .
whether marsh knew , or whether the genius in him painted it without his knowing , none could say .
but denis and his father could not have known till they saw the picture .
surpassing all in horror was the streaming black hair which covered the rotting body , but which was itself not even slightly decayed .
all i had heard of it was amply verified .
it was nothing human , this ropy , sinuous , , flood of serpent darkness .
vile , independent life proclaimed itself at every unnatural twist and convolution , and the suggestion of numberless reptilian heads at the ends was far too marked to be illusory or accidental .
the blasphemous thing held me like a magnet .
i was helpless , and did not wonder at the myth of the gorgon glance which turned all beholders to stone .
then i thought i saw a change come over the thing .
the leering features perceptibly moved , so that the rotting jaw fell , allowing the thick , lips to disclose a row of pointed yellow fangs .
the pupils of the fiendish eyes dilated , and the eyes themselves seemed to bulge outward .
and the hair that accursed hair !
it had begun to rustle and wave perceptibly , the all turning toward de russy and vibrating as if to strike !
reason deserted me altogether , and before i knew what i was doing i drew my automatic and sent a shower of twelve bullets through the shocking canvas .
the whole thing at once fell to pieces , even the frame toppling from the easel and clattering to the floor .
but though this horror was shattered , another had risen before me in the form of de russy himself , whose maddened shrieks as he saw the picture vanish were almost as terrible as the picture itself had been .
with a scream of god , now you done it !
the frantic old man seized me violently by the arm and commenced to drag me out of the room and down the rickety stairs .
he had dropped the candle in his panic ; but dawn was near , and some faint grey light was filtering in through the windows .
i tripped and stumbled repeatedly , but never for a moment would my guide slacken his pace .
run !
he shrieked , run for your life !
you do know what you done !
i never told you the whole thing !
there were things i had to do the picture talked to me and told me .
i had to guard and keep it now the worst will happen !
she and that hair will come up out of their graves , for god knows what purpose !
hurry , man !
for god sake let get out of here while there time .
if you have a car take me along to cape girardeau with you .
it may well get me in the end , anywhere , but i give it a run for its money .
out of here quick !
as we reached the ground floor i became aware of a slow , curious thumping from the rear of the house , followed by a sound of a door shutting .
de russy had not heard the thumping , but the other noise caught his ear and drew from him the most terrible shriek that ever sounded in human throat .
oh , god great god that was the cellar door she coming by this time i was desperately wrestling with the rusty latch and sagging hinges of the great front door almost as frantic as my host now that i heard the slow , thumping tread approaching from the unknown rear rooms of the accursed mansion .
the night rain had warped the oaken planks , and the heavy door stuck and resisted even more strongly than it had when i forced an entrance the evening before .
somewhere a plank creaked beneath the foot of whatever was walking , and the sound seemed to snap the last cord of sanity in the poor old man .
with a roar like that of a maddened bull he released his grip on me and made a plunge to the right , through the open door of a room which i judged had been a parlour .
a second later , just as i got the front door open and was making my own escape , i heard the tinkling clatter of broken glass and knew he had leapt through a window .
and as i bounded off the sagging porch to commence my mad race down the long , drive i thought i could catch the thud of dead , dogged footsteps which did not follow me , but which kept leadenly on through the door of the cobwebbed parlour .
i looked backward only twice as i plunged heedlessly through the burrs and briers of that abandoned drive , past the dying lindens and grotesque , in the grey pallor of a cloudy november dawn .
the first time was when an acrid smell overtook me , and i thought of the candle de russy had dropped in the attic studio .
by then i was comfortably near the road , on the high place from which the roof of the distant house was clearly visible above its encircling trees ; and just as i expected , thick clouds of smoke were billowing out of the attic dormers and curling upward into the leaden heavens .
i thanked the powers of creation that an immemorial curse was about to be purged by fire and blotted from the earth .
but in the next instant came that second backward look in which i glimpsed two other things things that cancelled most of the relief and gave me a supreme shock from which i shall never recover .
i have said that i was on a high part of the drive , from which much of the plantation behind me was visible .
this vista included not only the house and its trees but some of the abandoned and partly flooded land beside the river , and several bends of the drive i had been so hastily traversing .
in both of these latter places i now beheld sights or suspicions of sights which i wish devoutly i could deny .
it was a faint , distant scream which made me turn back again , and as i did so i caught a trace of motion on the dull grey marshy plain behind the house .
at that human figures are very small , yet i thought the motion resolved itself into two of these pursuer and pursued .
i even thought i saw the leading figure overtaken , seized , and dragged violently in the direction of the now burning house .
but i could not watch the outcome , for at once a nearer sight obtruded itself a suggestion of motion among the underbrush at a point some distance back along the deserted drive .
unmistakably , the weeds and bushes and briers were swaying as no wind could sway them ; swaying as if some large , swift serpent were wriggling purposefully along on the ground in pursuit of me .
that was all i could stand .
i scrambled along madly for the gate , heedless of torn clothing and bleeding scratches , and jumped into the roadster parked under the great evergreen tree .
it was a bedraggled , sight ; but the works were unharmed and i had no trouble in starting the thing .
i went on blindly in the direction the car was headed for nothing was in my mind but to get away from that frightful region of nightmares and cacodaemons to get away as quickly and as far as gasoline could take me .
about three or four miles along the road a farmer hailed me a kindly , drawling fellow of middle age and considerable native intelligence .
i was glad to slow down and ask directions , though i knew i must present a strange enough aspect .
the man readily told me the way to cape girardeau , and inquired where i had come from in such a state at such an early hour .
thinking it best to say little , i merely mentioned that i had been caught in the night rain and had taken shelter at a nearby farmhouse , afterward losing my way in the underbrush trying to find my car .
at a farmhouse , eh ?
wonder whose it could ' a been .
ai nothin ' standin ' this side o ' jim ferris ' place acrost barker crick , an ' that all o ' twenty miles by the rud .
i gave a start , and wondered what fresh mystery this portended .
then i asked my informant if he had overlooked the large ruined plantation house whose ancient gate bordered the road not far back .
funny ye sh recolleck that , stranger !
must a ben here afore some time .
but that house ai here now .
burnt down five or six years ago and they did tell some queer stories about it .
i shuddered .
you mean riverside ol ' man de russy place .
queer goin on there fifteen or twenty years ago .
ol ' man boy married a gal from abroad , and some folks thought she was a mighty odd sort .
did like the looks of her , then she and the boy went off sudden , and later on the ol ' man said he was kilt in the war .
but some o ' the niggers hinted queer things .
got around at last that the ol ' fellow fell in love with the gal himself and kilt her and the boy .
that place was sure enough haunted by a black snake , mean that what it may .
then five or six years ago the ol ' man disappeared and the house burned down .
some do say he was burnt up in it .
it was a mornin ' after a rainy night just like this , when lots o ' folks heard an awful yellin ' across the fields in old de russy voice .
when they stopped and looked , they see the house goin ' up in smoke quick as a wink that place was all like tinder anyhow , rain or no rain .
nobody never seen the ol ' man again , but onct in a while they tell of the ghost of that big black snake glidin ' aroun ' .
what d make of it , anyhow ?
you seem to hev knowed the place .
did ye ever hear tell of the de russys ?
what d reckon was the trouble with that gal young denis married ?
she kinder made everybody shiver and feel hateful , though ye could never tell why .
i was trying to think , but that process was almost beyond me now .
the house burned down years ago ?
then where , and under what conditions , had i passed the night ?
and why did i know what i knew of these things ?
even as i pondered i saw a hair on my coat sleeve the short , grey hair of an old man .
in the end i drove on without telling anything .
but did i hint that gossip was wronging the poor old planter who had suffered so much .
i made it clear as if from distant but authentic reports wafted among friends that if anyone was to blame for the trouble at riverside it was the woman , marceline .
she was not suited to missouri ways , i said , and it was too bad that denis had ever married her .
more i did not intimate , for i felt that the de russys , with their proudly cherished honour and high , sensitive spirits , would not wish me to say more .
they had borne enough , god knows , without the countryside guessing what a daemon of the pit what a gorgon of the elder blasphemies had come to flaunt their ancient and stainless name .
nor was it right that the neighbours should know that other horror which my strange host of the night could not bring himself to tell me that horror which he must have learned , as i learned it , from details in the lost masterpiece of poor frank marsh .
it would be too hideous if they knew that the heiress of riverside the accursed gorgon or lamia whose hateful crinkly coil of must even now be brooding and twining vampirically around an artist skeleton in a grave beneath a charred foundation was faintly , subtly , yet to the eyes of genius unmistakably the scion of zimbabwe most primal grovellers .
no wonder she owned a link with that old for , though in deceitfully slight proportion , marceline was a negress .
in the valley of nis the accursed waning moon shines thinly , tearing a path for its light with feeble horns through the lethal foliage of a great .
and within the depths of the valley , where the light reaches not , move forms not meant to be beheld .
rank is the herbage on each slope , where evil vines and creeping plants crawl amidst the stones of ruined palaces , twining tightly about broken columns and strange monoliths , and heaving up marble pavements laid by forgotten hands .
and in trees that grow gigantic in crumbling courtyards leap little apes , while in and out of deep writhe poison serpents and scaly things without a name .
vast are the stones which sleep beneath coverlets of dank moss , and mighty were the walls from which they fell .
for all time did their builders erect them , and in sooth they yet serve nobly , for beneath them the grey toad makes his habitation .
at the very bottom of the valley lies the river than , whose waters are slimy and filled with weeds .
from hidden springs it rises , and to subterranean grottoes it flows , so that the daemon of the valley knows not why its waters are red , nor whither they are bound .
the genie that haunts the moonbeams spake to the daemon of the valley , saying , i am old , and forget much .
tell me the deeds and aspect and name of them who built these things of stone .
and the daemon replied , i am memory , and am wise in lore of the past , but i too am old .
these beings were like the waters of the river than , not to be understood .
their deeds i recall not , for they were but of the moment .
their aspect i recall dimly , it was like to that of the little apes in the trees .
their name i recall clearly , for it rhymed with that of the river .
these beings of yesterday were called man .
so the genie flew back to the thin horned moon , and the daemon looked intently at a little ape in a tree that grew in a crumbling courtyard .
nyarlathotep the crawling chaos i am the last i will tell the audient void
i do not recall distinctly when it began , but it was months ago .
the general tension was horrible .
to a season of political and social upheaval was added a strange and brooding apprehension of hideous physical danger ; a danger widespread and , such a danger as may be imagined only in the most terrible phantasms of the night .
i recall that the people went about with pale and worried faces , and whispered warnings and prophecies which no one dared consciously repeat or acknowledge to himself that he had heard .
a sense of monstrous guilt was upon the land , and out of the abysses between the stars swept chill currents that made men shiver in dark and lonely places .
there was a daemoniac alteration in the sequence of the seasons the autumn heat lingered fearsomely , and everyone felt that the world and perhaps the universe had passed from the control of known gods or forces to that of gods or forces which were unknown .
and it was then that nyarlathotep came out of egypt .
who he was , none could tell , but he was of the old native blood and looked like a pharaoh .
the fellahin knelt when they saw him , yet could not say why .
he said he had risen up out of the blackness of centuries , and that he had heard messages from places not on this planet .
into the lands of civilisation came nyarlathotep , swarthy , slender , and sinister , always buying strange instruments of glass and metal and combining them into instruments yet stranger .
he spoke much of the sciences of electricity and psychology and gave exhibitions of power which sent his spectators away speechless , yet which swelled his fame to exceeding magnitude .
men advised one another to see nyarlathotep , and shuddered .
and where nyarlathotep went , rest vanished ; for the small hours were rent with the screams of nightmare .
never before had the screams of nightmare been such a public problem ; now the wise men almost wished they could forbid sleep in the small hours , that the shrieks of cities might less horribly disturb the pale , pitying moon as it glimmered on green waters gliding under bridges , and old steeples crumbling against a sickly sky .
i remember when nyarlathotep came to my city the great , the old , the terrible city of unnumbered crimes .
my friend had told me of him , and of the impelling fascination and allurement of his revelations , and i burned with eagerness to explore his uttermost mysteries .
my friend said they were horrible and impressive beyond my most fevered imaginings ; and what was thrown on a screen in the darkened room prophesied things none but nyarlathotep dared prophesy , and in the sputter of his sparks there was taken from men that which had never been taken before yet which shewed only in the eyes .
and i heard it hinted abroad that those who knew nyarlathotep looked on sights which others saw not .
it was in the hot autumn that i went through the night with the restless crowds to see nyarlathotep ; through the stifling night and up the endless stairs into the choking room .
and shadowed on a screen , i saw hooded forms amidst ruins , and yellow evil faces peering from behind fallen monuments .
and i saw the world battling against blackness ; against the waves of destruction from ultimate space ; whirling , churning , struggling around the dimming , cooling sun .
then the sparks played amazingly around the heads of the spectators , and hair stood up on end whilst shadows more grotesque than i can tell came out and squatted on the heads .
and when i , who was colder and more scientific than the rest , mumbled a trembling protest about imposture and static electricity , nyarlathotep drove us all out , down the dizzy stairs into the damp , hot , deserted midnight streets .
i screamed aloud that i was not afraid ; that i never could be afraid ; and others screamed with me for solace .
we swore to one another that the city was exactly the same , and still alive ; and when the electric lights began to fade we cursed the company over and over again , and laughed at the queer faces we made .
i believe we felt something coming down from the greenish moon , for when we began to depend on its light we drifted into curious involuntary marching formations and seemed to know our destinations though we dared not think of them .
once we looked at the pavement and found the blocks loose and displaced by grass , with scarce a line of rusted metal to shew where the tramways had run .
and again we saw a , lone , windowless , dilapidated , and almost on its side .
when we gazed around the horizon , we could not find the third tower by the river , and noticed that the silhouette of the second tower was ragged at the top .
then we split up into narrow columns , each of which seemed drawn in a different direction .
one disappeared in a narrow alley to the left , leaving only the echo of a shocking moan .
another filed down a subway entrance , howling with a laughter that was mad .
my own column was sucked toward the open country , and presently i felt a chill which was not of the hot autumn ; for as we stalked out on the dark moor , we beheld around us the hellish of evil snows .
trackless , inexplicable snows , swept asunder in one direction only , where lay a gulf all the blacker for its glittering walls .
the column seemed very thin indeed as it plodded dreamily into the gulf .
i lingered behind , for the black rift in the snow was frightful , and i thought i had heard the reverberations of a disquieting wail as my companions vanished ; but my power to linger was slight .
as if beckoned by those who had gone before , i between the titanic snowdrifts , quivering and afraid , into the sightless vortex of the unimaginable .
screamingly sentient , dumbly delirious , only the gods that were can tell .
a sickened , sensitive shadow writhing in hands that are not hands , and whirled blindly past ghastly midnights of rotting creation , corpses of dead worlds with sores that were cities , charnel winds that brush the pallid stars and make them flicker low .
beyond the worlds vague ghosts of monstrous things ; columns of unsanctifled temples that rest on nameless rocks beneath space and reach up to dizzy vacua above the spheres of light and darkness .
and through this revolting graveyard of the universe the muffled , maddening beating of drums , and thin , monotonous whine of blasphemous flutes from inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time ; the detestable pounding and piping whereunto dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic , tenebrous ultimate gods the blind , voiceless , mindless gargoyles whose soul is nyarlathotep .
i know i more nervous than i was when you saw me last year , but you do need to hold a clinic over it .
there plenty of reason , god knows , and i fancy i lucky to be sane at all .
why the third degree ?
you did use to be so inquisitive .
well , if you must hear it , i do know why you should .
maybe you ought to , anyhow , for you kept writing me like a grieved parent when you heard i begun to cut the art club and keep away from pickman .
now that he disappeared i go round to the club once in a while , but my nerves are what they were .
no , i do know what become of pickman , and i do like to guess .
you might have surmised i had some inside information when i dropped him and that why i do want to think where he gone .
let the police find what they can it wo be much , judging from the fact that they do know yet of the old north end place he hired under the name of peters .
i not sure that i could find it again myself not that i ever try , even in broad daylight !
yes , i do know , or am afraid i know , why he maintained it .
i coming to that .
and i think you understand before i through why i do tell the police .
they would ask me to guide them , but i could go back there even if i knew the way .
there was something there and now i ca use the subway or ( and you may as well have your laugh at this , too ) go down into cellars any more .
i should think you have known i did drop pickman for the same silly reasons that fussy old women like reid or joe minot or rosworth did .
morbid art does shock me , and when a man has the genius pickman had i feel it an honour to know him , no matter what direction his work takes .
boston never had a greater painter than richard upton pickman .
i said it at first and i say it still , and i never swerved an inch , either , when he showed that feeding ' .
that , you remember , was when minot cut him .
you know , it takes profound art and profound insight into nature to turn out stuff like pickman .
any hack can splash paint around wildly and call it a nightmare or a witches ' sabbath or a portrait of the devil , but only a great painter can make such a thing really scare or ring true .
that because only a real artist knows the actual anatomy of the terrible or the physiology of exact sort of lines and proportions that connect up with latent instincts or hereditary memories of fright , and the proper colour contrasts and lighting effects to stir the dormant sense of strangeness .
i do have to tell you why a fuseli really brings a shiver while a cheap frontispiece merely makes us laugh .
there something those fellows catch beyond life that they able to make us catch for a second .
doré had it .
sime has it .
angarola of chicago has it .
and pickman had it as no man ever had it before or i hope to heaven ever will again .
do ask me what it is they see .
you know , in ordinary art , there all the difference in the world between the vital , breathing things drawn from nature or models and the artificial truck that commercial small fry reel off in a bare studio by rule .
well , i should say that the really weird artist has a kind of vision which makes models , or summons up what amounts to actual scenes from the spectral world he lives in .
anyhow , he manages to turn out results that differ from the pretender dreams in just about the same way that the life painter results differ from the concoctions of a correspondence school cartoonist .
if i had ever seen what pickman saw but no !
here , let have a drink before we get any deeper .
god , i would be alive if i ever seen what that man if he was a man saw ; !
you recall that pickman forte was faces .
i do believe anybody since goya could put so much of sheer hell into a set of features or a twist of expression .
and before goya you have to go back to the mediaeval chaps who did the gargoyles and chimaeras on notre dame and mont .
they believed all sorts of things and maybe they saw all sorts of things , too , for the middle ages had some curious phases i remember your asking pickman yourself once , the year before you went away , wherever in thunder he got such ideas and visions .
was that a nasty laugh he gave you ?
it was partly because of that laugh that reid dropped him .
reid , you know , had just taken up comparative pathology , and was full of pompous stuff ' about the biological or evolutionary significance of this or that mental or physical symptom .
he said pickman repelled him more and more every day , and almost frightened him towards the last that the fellow features and expression were slowly developing in a way he did like ; in a way that was human .
he had a lot of talk about diet , and said pickman must be abnormal and eccentric to the last degree .
i suppose you told reid , if you and he had any correspondence over it , that he let pickman paintings get on his nerves or harrow up his imagination .
i know i told him that myself then .
but keep in mind that i did drop pickman for anything like this .
on the contrary , my admiration for him kept growing ; for that feeding ' was a tremendous achievement .
as you know , the club would exhibit it , and the museum of fine arts would accept it as a gift ; and i can add that nobody would buy it , so pickman had it right in his house till he went .
now his father has it in salem you know pickman comes of old salem stock , and had a witch ancestor hanged in .
i got into the habit of calling on pickman quite often , especially after i began making notes for a monograph on weird art .
probably it was his work which put the idea into my head , and anyhow , i found him a mine of data and suggestions when i came to develop it .
he showed me all the paintings and drawings he had about ; including some ink sketches that would , i verily believe , have got him kicked out of the club if many of the members had seen them .
before long i was pretty nearly a devotee , and would listen for hours like a schoolboy to art theories and philosophic speculations wild enough to qualify him for the danvers asylum .
my , coupled with the fact that people generally were commencing to have less and less to do with him , made him get very confidential with me ; and one evening he hinted that if i were fairly and none too squeamish , he might show me something rather unusual something a bit stronger than anything he had in the house .
know , ' he said , are things that wo do for newbury street things that are out of place here , and that ca be conceived here , anyhow .
it my business to catch the overtones of the soul , and you wo find those in a parvenu set of artificial streets on made land .
back bay is boston it is anything yet , because it had no time to pick up memories and attract local spirits .
if there are any ghosts here , they the tame ghosts of a salt marsh and a shallow cove ; and i want human ghosts the ghosts of beings highly organized enough to have looked on hell and known the meaning of what they saw .
place for an artist to live is the north end .
if any aesthete were sincere , he put up with the slums for the sake of the massed traditions .
god , man !
do you realize that places like that were merely made , but actually grew ?
generation after generation lived and felt and died there , and in days when people were afraid to live and fed and die .
do you know there was a mill on copp hill in , and that half the present streets were laid out by ?
i can show you houses that have stood two centuries and a half and more ; houses that have witnessed what would make a modern house crumble into powder .
what do moderns know of life and the forces behind it ?
you call the salem witchcraft a delusion , but i wager my could have told you things .
they hanged her on gallows hill , with cotton mather looking sanctimoniously on .
mather , damn him , was afraid somebody might succeed in kicking free of this accursed cage of monotony i wish someone had laid a spell on him or sucked his blood in the night !
' i can show you a house he lived in , and i can show you another one he was afraid to enter in spite of all his fine bold talk .
he knew things he did dare put into that stupid magnalia or that puerile wonders of the invisible world .
look here , do you know the whole north end once had a set of tunnels that kept certain people in touch with each other houses , and the burying ground , and the sea ?
let them prosecute and persecute above ground things went on every day that they could reach , and voices laughed at night that they could place !
, man , out of ten surviving houses built before and not moved since i wager that in eight i can show you something queer in the cellar .
there hardly a month that you do read of workmen finding arches and wells leading nowhere in this or that old place as it comes down you could see one near henchman street from the elevated last year .
there were witches and what their spells summoned ; pirates and what they brought in from the sea ; smugglers ; privateers and i tell you , people knew how to live , and how to enlarge the bounds of life , in the old time !
this was the only world a bold and wise man could know faugh !
and to think of today in contrast , with such brains that even a club of supposed artists gets shudders and convulsions if a picture goes beyond the feelings of a beacon street !
only saving grace of the present is that it too damned stupid to question the past very closely .
what do maps and records and guide books really tell of the north end ?
bah !
at a guess i guarantee to lead you to thirty or forty alleys and networks of alleys north of prince street that are suspected by ten living beings outside of the foreigners that swarm them .
and what do those dagoes know of their meaning ?
no , thurber , these ancient places are dreaming gorgeously and with wonder and terror and escapes from the commonplace , and yet there not a living soul to understand or profit by them .
or rather , there only one living soul for i have been digging around in the past for nothing ; !
here , you interested in this sort of thing .
what if i told you that i got another studio up there , where i can catch the night spirit of antique horror and paint things that i could even think of in newbury street ?
naturally i do tell those cursed old maids at the club with reid , damn him , whispering even as it is that i a sort of monster bound down the toboggan of reverse evolution .
yes , thurber , i decided long ago that one must paint terror as well as beauty from life , so i did some exploring in places where i had reason to know terror lives .
' i got a place that i do believe three living nordic men besides myself have ever seen .
it is so very far from the elevated as distance goes , but it centuries away as the soul goes .
i took it because of the queer old brick well in the cellar one of the sort i told you about .
the shack almost tumbling down so that nobody else would live there , and i hate to tell you how little i pay for it .
the windows are boarded up , but i like that all the better , since i do want daylight for what i do .
i paint in the cellar , where the inspiration is thickest , but i other rooms furnished on the ground floor .
a sicilian owns it , and i hired it under the name of peters .
, if you game , i take you there tonight .
i think you enjoy the pictures , for , as i said , i let myself go a bit there .
it no vast tour i sometimes do it on foot , for i do want to attract attention with a taxi in such a place .
we can take the shuttle at the south station for battery street , and after that the walk is much . '
well , eliot , there was much for me to do after that harangue but to keep myself from running instead of walking for the first vacant cab we could sight .
we changed to the elevated at the south station , and at about twelve had climbed down the steps at battery street and struck along the old waterfront past constitution wharf .
i did keep track of the cross streets , and ca tell you yet which it was we turned up , but i know it was greenough lane .
when we did turn , it was to climb through the deserted length of the oldest and dirtiest alley i ever saw in my life , with gables , broken windows , and archaic chimneys that stood out against the moonlit sky .
i do believe there were three houses in sight that had been standing in cotton mather time certainly i glimpsed at least two with an overhang , and once i thought i saw a peaked of the almost forgotten pre gambrel type , though antiquarians tell us there are none left in boston .
from that alley , which had a dim light , we turned to the left into an equally silent and still narrower alley with no light at all and in a minute made what i think was an bend towards the right in the dark .
not long after this pickman produced a flashlight and revealed an antediluvian door that looked damnably worm eaten .
unlocking it , he ushered me into a barren hallway with what was once splendid panelling simple , of course , but thrillingly suggestive of the times of andros and phipps and the witchcraft .
then he took me through a door on the left , lighted an oil lamp , and told me to make myself at home .
now , eliot , i what the man in the street would call fairly boiled , ' but i confess that what i saw on the walls of that room gave me a bad turn .
they were his pictures , you know the ones he could paint or even show in newbury street and he was right when he said he had himself go . '
here have another drink i need one anyhow !
there no use in my trying to tell you what they were like , because the awful , the blasphemous horror , and the unbelievable loathsomeness and moral foetor came from simple touches quite beyond the power of words to classify .
there was none of the exotic technique you see in sidney sime , none of the landscapes and lunar fungi that clark ashton smith uses to freeze the blood .
the backgrounds were mostly old churchyards , deep woods , cliffs by the sea , brick tunnels , ancient panelled rooms , or simple vaults of masonry .
copp hill burying ground , which could not be many blocks away from this very house , was a favourite scene .
the madness and monstrosity lay in the figures in the pickman morbid art was one of demoniac portraiture .
these figures were seldom completely human , but often approached humanity in varying degree .
most of the bodies , while roughly bipedal , had a forward slumping , and a vaguely canine cast .
the texture of the majority was a kind of unpleasant rubberiness .
ugh !
i can see them now !
their occupations well , do ask me to be too precise .
they were usually feeding i wo say on what .
they were sometimes shown in groups in cemeteries or underground passages , and often appeared to be in battle over their prey or rather , their .
and what damnable expressiveness pickman sometimes gave the sightless faces of this charnel booty !
occasionally the things were shown leaping through open windows at night , or squatting on the chests of sleepers , worrying at their throats .
one canvas showed a ring of them baying about a hanged witch on gallows hill , whose dead face held a close kinship to theirs .
but do get the idea that it was all this hideous business of theme and setting which struck me faint .
i not a kid , and i seen much like this before .
it was the faces , eliot , those accursed faces , that leered and slavered out of the canvas with the very breath of life !
by god , man , i verily believe they were alive !
that nauseous wizard had waked the fires of hell in pigment , and his brush had been a wand .
give me that decanter , eliot !
there was one thing called lesson ' heaven pity me , that i ever saw it !
listen can you fancy a squatting circle of nameless things in a churchyard teaching a small child how to feed like themselves ?
the price of a changeling , i suppose you know the old myth about how the weird people leave their spawn in cradles in exchange for the human babes they steal .
pickman was showing what happens to those stolen babes how they grow up and then i began to see a hideous relationship in the faces of the human and figures .
he was , in all his gradations of morbidity between the frankly and the degradedly human , establishing a sardonic linkage and evolution .
the were developed from mortals !
and no sooner had i wondered what he made of their own young as left with mankind in the form of changelings , than my eye caught a picture embodying that very thought .
it was that of an ancient puritan interior a heavily beamed room with lattice windows , a settle , and clumsy furniture , with the family sitting about while the father read from the scriptures .
every face but one showed nobility and reverence , but that one reflected the mockery of the pit .
it was that of a young man in years , and no doubt belonged to a supposed son of that pious father , but in essence it was the kin of the unclean things .
it was their changeling and in a spirit of supreme irony pickman had given the features a very perceptible resemblance to his own .
by this time pickman had lighted a lamp in an adjoining room and was politely holding open the door for me ; asking me if i would care to see his studies . '
i had been able to give him much of my opinions i was too speechless with fright and loathing but i think he fully understood and felt highly complimented .
and now i want to assure you again , eliot , that i no mollycoddle to scream at anything which shows a bit of departure from the usual .
i and decently sophisticated , and i guess you saw enough of me in france to know i not easily knocked out .
remember , too , that i just about recovered my wind and gotten used to those frightful pictures which turned colonial new england into a kind of annex of hell .
well , in spite of all this , that next room forced a real scream out of me , and i had to clutch at the doorway to keep from keeling over .
the other chamber had shown a pack of ghouls and witches the world of our forefathers , but this one brought the horror right into our own daily life !
god , how that man could paint !
there was a study called accident , ' in which a flock of the vile things were clambering up from some unknown catacomb through a crack in the floor of the boston street subway and attacking a crowd of people on the platform .
another showed a dance on copp hill among the tombs with the background of today .
then there were any number of cellar views , with monsters creeping in through holes and rifts in the masonry and grinning as they squatted behind barrels or furnaces and waited for their first victim to descend the stairs .
one disgusting canvas seemed to depict a vast of beacon hill , with armies of the mephitic monsters squeezing themselves through burrows that honeycombed the ground .
dances in the modern cemeteries were freely pictured , and another conception somehow shocked me more than all the rest a scene in an unknown vault , where scores of the beasts crowded about one who had a boston guidebook and was evidently reading aloud .
all were pointing to a certain passage , and every face seemed so distorted with epileptic and reverberant laughter that i almost thought i heard the fiendish echoes .
the title of the picture was , , lowell and longfellow lie buried in mount auburn . '
as i gradually steadied myself and got readjusted to this second room of deviltry and morbidity , i began to analyse some of the points in my sickening loathing .
in the first place , i said to myself , these things repelled because of the utter inhumanity and callous crudity they showed in pickman .
the fellow must be a relentless enemy of all mankind to take such glee in the torture of brain and flesh and the degradation of the mortal tenement .
in the second place , they terrified because of their very greatness .
their art was the art that convinced when we saw the pictures we saw the demons themselves and were afraid of them .
and the queer part was , that pickman got none of his power from the use of selectiveness or bizarrerie .
nothing was blurred , distorted , or conventionalized ; outlines were sharp and lifelike , and details were almost painfully defined .
and the faces !
it was not any mere artist interpretation that we saw ; it was pandemonium itself , crystal clear in stark objectivity .
that was it , by heaven !
the man was not a fantaisiste or romanticist at all he did not even try to give us the churning , prismatic ephemera of dreams , but coldly and sardonically reflected some stable , mechanistic , and horror world which he saw fully , brilliantly , squarely , and unfalteringly .
god knows what that world can have been , or where he ever glimpsed the blasphemous shapes that loped and trotted and crawled through it ; but whatever the baffling source of his images , one thing was plain .
pickman was in every sense in conception and in execution a thorough , painstaking , and almost scientific realist .
my host was now leading the way down the cellar to his actual studio , and i braced myself for some hellish efforts among the unfinished canvases .
as we reached the bottom of the damp stairs he fumed his to a corner of the large open space at hand , revealing the circular brick curb of what was evidently a great well in the earthen floor .
we walked nearer , and i saw that it must be five feet across , with walls a good foot thick and some six inches above the ground level solid work of the seventeenth century , or i was much mistaken .
that , pickman said , was the kind of thing he had been talking about an aperture of the network of tunnels that used to undermine the hill .
i noticed idly that it did not seem to be bricked up , and that a heavy disc of wood formed the apparent cover .
thinking of the things this well must have been connected with if pickman wild hints had not been mere rhetoric , i shivered slightly ; then turned to follow him up a step and through a narrow door into a room of fair size , provided with a wooden floor and furnished as a studio .
an acetylene gas outfit gave the light necessary for work .
the unfinished pictures on easels or propped against the walls were as ghastly as the finished ones upstairs , and showed the painstaking methods of the artist .
scenes were blocked out with extreme care , and pencilled guide lines told of the minute exactitude which pickman used in getting the right perspective and proportions .
the man was great i say it even now , knowing as much as i do .
a large camera on a table excited my notice , and pickman told me that he used it in taking scenes for backgrounds , so that he might paint them from photographs in the studio instead of carting his oufit around the town for this or that view .
he thought a photograph quite as good as an actual scene or model for sustained work , and declared he employed them regularly .
there was something very disturbing about the nauseous sketches and monstrosities that leered round from every side of the room , and when pickman suddenly unveiled a huge canvas on the side away from the light i could not for my life keep back a loud scream the second i had emitted that night .
it echoed and echoed through the dim vaultings of that ancient and nitrous cellar , and i had to choke back a flood of reaction that threatened to burst out as hysterical laughter .
merciful creator !
eliot , but i do know how much was real and how much was feverish fancy .
it does seem to me that earth can hold a dream like that !
it was a colossal and nameless blasphemy with glaring red eyes , and it held in bony claws a thing that had been a man , gnawing at the head as a child nibbles at a stick of candy .
its position was a kind of crouch , and as one looked one felt that at any moment it might drop its present prey and seek a juicier morsel .
but damn it all , it was even the fiendish subject that made it such an immortal fountain head of all panic not that , nor the dog face with its pointed ears , bloodshot eyes , flat nose , and drooling lips .
it was the scaly claws nor the body nor the of these , though any one of them might well have driven an excitable man to madness .
it was the technique , eliot the cursed , the impious , the unnatural technique !
as i am a living being , i never elsewhere saw the actual breath of life so fused into a canvas .
the monster was there it glared and gnawed and gnawed and glared and i knew that only a suspension of nature laws could ever let a man paint a thing like that without a model without some glimpse of the nether world which no mortal unsold to the fiend has ever had .
pinned with a to a vacant part of the canvas was a piece of paper now badly curled up probably , i thought , a photograph from which pickman meant to paint a background as hideous as the nightmare it was to enhance .
i reached out to uncurl and look at it , when suddenly i saw pickman start as if shot .
he had been listening with peculiar intensity ever since my shocked scream had waked unaccustomed echoes in the dark cellar , and now he seemed struck with a fright which , though not comparable to my own , had in it more of the physical than of the spiritual .
he drew a revolver and motioned me to silence , then stepped out into the main cellar and closed the door behind him .
i think i was paralysed for an instant .
imitating pickman listening , i fancied i heard a faint scurrying sound somewhere , and a series of squeals or beats in a direction i could determine .
i thought of huge rats and shuddered .
then there came a subdued sort of clatter which somehow set me all in gooseflesh a furtive , groping kind of clatter , though i ca attempt to convey what i mean in words .
it was like heavy wood falling on stone or brick wood on brick what did that make me think of ?
it came again , and louder .
there was a vibration as if the wood had fallen farther than it had fallen before .
after that followed a sharp grating noise , a shouted gibberish from pickman , and the deafening discharge of all six chambers of a revolver , fired spectacularly as a lion tamer might fire in the air for effect .
a muffled squeal or squawk , and a thud .
then more wood and brick grating , a pause , and the opening of the door at which i confess i started violently .
pickman reappeared with his smoking weapon , cursing the bloated rats that infested the ancient well .
deuce knows what they eat , thurber , ' he grinned , those archaic tunnels touched graveyard and and .
but whatever it is , they must have run short , for they were devilish anxious to get out .
your yelling stirred them up , i fancy .
better be cautious in these old places our rodent friends are the one drawback , though i sometimes think they a positive asset by way of atmosphere and colour . '
well , eliot , that was the end of the night adventure .
pickman had promised to show me the place , and heaven knows he had done it .
he led me out of that tangle of alleys in another direction , it seems , for when we sighted a we were in a street with monotonous rows of mingled tenement blocks and old houses .
charter street , it turned out to be , but i was too flustered to notice just where we hit it .
we were too late for the elevated , and walked back downtown through hanover street .
i remember that wall .
we switched from tremont up beacon , and pickman left me at the corner of joy , where i turned off .
i never spoke to him again .
why did i drop him ?
do be impatient .
wait till i ring for coffee .
we had enough of the other stuff , but i for one need something .
no it was the paintings i saw in that place ; though i swear they were enough to get him ostracised in of the homes and clubs of boston , and i guess you wo wonder now why i have to steer clear of subways and cellars .
it was something i found in my coat the next morning .
you know , the paper tacked to the frightful canvas in the cellar ; the thing i thought was a photograph of some scene he meant to use as a background for that monster .
that last scare had come while i was reaching to uncurl it , and it seems i had vacantly crumpled it into my pocket .
but here the coffee take it black , eliot , if you wise .
yes , that paper was the reason i dropped pickman ; richard upton pickman , the greatest artist i have ever known and the foulest being that ever leaped the bounds of life into the pits of myth and madness .
eliot old reid was right .
he was strictly human .
either he was born in strange shadow , or he found a way to unlock the forbidden gate .
it all the same now , for he gone back into the fabulous darkness he loved to haunt .
here , let have the chandelier going .
do ask me to explain or even conjecture about what i burned .
do ask me , either , what lay behind that scrambling pickman was so keen to pass off as rats .
there are secrets , you know , which might have come down from old salem times , and cotton mather tells even stranger things .
you know how damned lifelike pickman paintings were how we all wondered where he got those faces .
well that paper was a photograph of any background , after all .
what it showed was simply the monstrous being he was painting on that awful canvas .
it was the model he was using and its background was merely the wall of the cellar studio in minute detail .
but by god , eliot , it was a photograph from life !
attired simply , in a black evening dress , she appeared outwardly a typical product of modern civilization ; but tonight she felt the immeasurable gulf that separated her soul from all her prosaic surroundings .
was it because of the strange home in which she lived , that abode of coldness where relations were always strained and the inmates scarcely more than strangers ?
was it that , or was it some greater and less explicable misplacement in time and space , whereby she had been born too late , too early , or too far away from the haunts of her spirit ever to harmonize with the unbeautiful things of contemporary reality ?
to dispel the mood which was engulfing her more and more deeply each moment , she took a magazine from the table and searched for some healing bit of poetry .
poetry had always relieved her troubled mind better than anything else , though many things in the poetry she had seen detracted from the influence .
over parts of even the sublimest verses hung a chill vapor of sterile ugliness and restraint , like dust on a through which one views a magnificent sunset .
listlessly turning the magazine pages , as if searching for an elusive treasure , she suddenly came upon something which dispelled her languor .
an observer could have read her thoughts and told that she had discovered some image or dream which brought her nearer to her unattained goal than any image or dream she had seen before .
it was only a bit of vers libre , that pitiful compromise of the poet who overleaps prose yet falls short of the divine melody of numbers ; but it had in it all the unstudied music of a bard who lives and feels , who gropes ecstatically for unveiled beauty .
devoid of regularity , it yet had the harmony of winged , spontaneous words , a harmony missing from the formal , verse she had known .
as she read on , her surroundings gradually faded , and soon there lay about her only the mists of dream , the purple , mists beyond time , where only gods and dreamers walk .
amid the mists of dream the reader cried to the rhythmical stars , of her delight at the coming of a new age of song , a rebirth of pan .
half closing her eyes , she repeated words whose melody lay hidden like crystals at the bottom of a stream before dawn , hidden but to gleam effulgently at the birth of day .
out of the mists gleamed godlike the torm ot a youth , in winged helmet and sandals , , and of a beauty like to nothing on earth .
before the face of the sleeper he thrice waved the rod which apollo had given him in trade for the shell of melody , and upon her brow he placed a wreath of myrtle and roses .
then , adoring , hermes spoke nymph more fair than the sisters of cyene or the sky inhabiting atlantides , beloved of aphrodite and blessed of pallas , thou hast indeed discovered the secret of the gods , which lieth in beauty and song .
prophetess more lovely than the sybil of cumae when apollo first knew her , thou has truly spoken of the new age , for even now on maenalus , pan sighs and stretches in his sleep , wishful to wake and behold about him the little fauns and the antique satyrs .
in thy yearning hast thou divined what no mortal , saving only a few whom the world rejects , remembereth that the gods were never dead , but only sleeping the sleep and dreaming the dreams of gods in hesperian gardens beyond the golden sunset .
and now draweth nigh the time of their awakening , when coldness and ugliness shall perish , and zeus sit once more on olympus .
already the sea about paphos trembleth into a foam which only ancient skies have looked on before , and at night on helicon the shepherds hear strange murmurings and notes .
woods and fields are tremulous at twilight with the shimmering of white saltant forms , and immemorial ocean yields up curious sights beneath thin moons .
the gods are patient , and have slept long , but neither man nor giant shall defy the gods forever .
in tartarus the titans writhe and beneath the fiery aetna groan the children of uranus and gaea .
the day now dawns when man must answer for centuries of denial , but in sleeping the gods have grown kind and will not hurl him to the gulf made for deniers of gods .
instead will their vengeance smite the darkness , fallacy and ugliness which have turned the mind of man ; and under the sway of bearded saturnus shall mortals , once more sacrificing unto him , dwell in beauty and delight .
this night shalt thou know the favour of the gods , and behold on parnassus those dreams which the gods have through ages sent to earth to show that they are not dead .
for poets are the dreams of gods , and in each and every age someone hath sung unknowingly the message and the promise from the lotosgardens beyond the sunset .
then in his arms hermes bore the dreaming maiden through the skies .
gentle breezes from the tower of aiolas wafted them high above warm , scented seas , till suddenly they came upon zeus , holding court upon parnassus , his golden throne flanked by apollo and the muses on the right hand , and by dionysus and pleasure flushed bacchae on the left hand .
so much of splendour marcia had never seen before , either awake or in dreams , but its radiance did her no injury , as would have the radiance of lofty olympus ; for in this lesser court the father of gods had tempered his glories for the sight of mortals .
before the mouth of the corycian cave sat in a row six noble forms with the aspect of mortals , but the countenances of gods .
these the dreamer recognized from images of them which she had beheld , and she knew that they were none else than the divine maeonides , the avernian dante , the more than mortal shakespeare , the milton , the cosmic goethe and the musalan keats .
these were those messengers whom the gods had sent to tell men that pan had passed not away , but only slept ; for it is in poetry that gods speak to men .
then spake the thunderer daughter for , being one of my endless line , thou art indeed my daughter behold upon ivory thrones of honour the august messengers gods have sent down that in the words and writing of men there may be still some traces of divine beauty .
other bards have men justly crowned with enduring laurels , but these hath apollo crowned , and these have i set in places apart , as mortals who have spoken the language of the gods .
long have we dreamed in lotosgardens beyond the west , and spoken only through our dreams ; but the time approaches when our voices shall not be silent .
it is a time of awakening and change .
once more hath phaeton ridden low , searing the fields and drying the streams .
in gaul lone nymphs with disordered hair weep beside fountains that are no more , and pine over rivers turned red with the blood of mortals .
ares and his train have gone forth with the madness of gods and have returned deimos and phobos glutted with unnatural delight .
tellus moons with grief , and the faces of men are as the faces of erinyes , even as when astraea fled to the skies , and the waves of our bidding encompassed all the land saving this high peak alone .
amidst this chaos , prepared to herald his coming yet to conceal his arrival , even now toileth our latest born messenger , in whose dreams are all the images which other messengers have dreamed before him .
he it is that we have chosen to blend into one glorious whole all the beauty that the world hath known before , and to write words wherein shall echo all the wisdom and the loveliness of the past .
he it is who shall proclaim our return and sing of the days to come when fauns and dryads shall haunt their accustomed groves in beauty .
guided was our choice by those who now sit before the corycian grotto on thrones of ivory , and in whose songs thou shalt hear notes of sublimity by which years hence thou shalt know the greater messenger when he cometh .
attend their voices as one by one they sing to thee here .
each note shall thou hear again in the poetry which is to come , the poetry which shall bring peace and pleasure to thy soul , though search for it through bleak years thou must .
attend with diligence , for each chord that vibrates away into hiding shall appear again to thee after thou hast returned to earth , as alpheus , sinking his waters into the soul of hellas , appears as the crystal arethusa in remote sicilia .
then arose homeros , the ancient among bards , who took his lyre and chanted his hymn to aphrodite .
no word of greek did marcia know , yet did the message not fall vainly upon her ears , for in the cryptic rhythm was that which spake to all mortals and gods , and needed no interpreter .
so too the songs of dante and goethe , whose unknown words dave the ether with melodies easy to ready and adore .
but at last remembered accents resounded before the listener .
it was the swan of avon , once a god among men , and still a god among gods accents still more familiar arose as milton , blind no more , declaimed immortal harmony last of all came the young voice of keats , closest of all the messengers to the beauteous as the singer ceased , there came a sound in the wind blowing from far egypt , where at night aurora mourns by the nile for her slain memnon .
to the feet of the thunderer flew the goddess and , kneeling , cried , master , it is time i unlocked the gates of the east .
and phoebus , handing his lyre to calliope , his bride among the muses , prepared to depart for the jewelled and palace of the sun , where fretted the steeds already harnessed to the golden car of day .
so zeus descended from his cavern throne and placed his hand upon the head of marcia , saying daughter , the dawn is nigh , and it is well that thou shouldst return before the awakening of mortals to thy home .
weep not at the bleakness of thy life , for the shadow of false faiths will soon be gone and the gods shall once more walk among men .
search thou unceasingly for our messenger , for in him wilt thou find peace and comfort .
by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness , and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find that which it craveth .
as zeus ceased , the young hermes gently seized the maiden and bore her up toward the fading stars , up and westward over unseen seas .
and as she speaks there comes again a vision of parnassus and the far off sound of a mighty voice saying , by his word shall thy steps be guided to happiness , and in his dreams of beauty shall thy spirit find all that it craveth .
high up , crowning the grassy summit of a swelling mount whose sides are wooded near the base with the gnarled trees of the primeval forest stands the old chateau of my ancestors .
for centuries its lofty battlements have frowned down upon the wild and rugged countryside about , serving as a home and stronghold for the proud house whose honored line is older even than the castle walls .
these ancient turrets , stained by the storms of generations and crumbling under the slow yet mighty pressure of time , formed in the ages of feudalism one of the most dreaded and formidable fortresses in all france .
from its machicolated parapets and mounted battlements barons , counts , and even kings had been defied , yet never had its spacious halls resounded to the footsteps of the invader .
but since those glorious years , all is changed .
a poverty but little above the level of dire want , together with a pride of name that forbids its alleviation by the pursuits of commercial life , have prevented the scions of our line from maintaining their estates in pristine splendour ; and the falling stones of the walls , the overgrown vegetation in the parks , the dry and dusty moat , the courtyards , and toppling towers without , as well as the sagging floors , the wainscots , and the faded tapestries within , all tell a gloomy tale of fallen grandeur .
as the ages passed , first one , then another of the four great turrets were left to ruin , until at last but a single tower housed the sadly reduced descendants of the once mighty lords of the estate .
it was in one of the vast and gloomy chambers of this remaining tower that i , antoine , last of the unhappy and accursed counts de , first saw the light of day , ninety long years ago .
within these walls and amongst the dark and shadowy forests , the wild ravines and grottos of the hillside below , were spent the first years of my troubled life .
my parents i never knew .
my father had been killed at the age of thirty two , a month before i was born , by the fall of a stone somehow dislodged from one of the deserted parapets of the castle .
and my mother having died at my birth , my care and education devolved solely upon one remaining servitor , an old and trusted man of considerable intelligence , whose name i remember as pierre .
i was an only child and the lack of companionship which this fact entailed upon me was augmented by the strange care exercised by my aged guardian , in excluding me from the society of the peasant children whose abodes were scattered here and there upon the plains that surround the base of the hill .
at that time , pierre said that this restriction was imposed upon me because my noble birth placed me above association with such plebeian company .
now i know that its real object was to keep from my ears the idle tales of the dread curse upon our line that were nightly told and magnified by the simple tenantry as they conversed in hushed accents in the glow of their cottage hearths .
thus isolated , and thrown upon my own resources , i spent the hours of my childhood in poring over the ancient tomes that filled the library of the chateau , and in roaming without aim or purpose through the perpetual dust of the spectral wood that clothes the side of the hill near its foot .
it was perhaps an effect of such surroundings that my mind early acquired a shade of melancholy .
those studies and pursuits which partake of the dark and occult in nature most strongly claimed my attention .
of my own race i was permitted to learn singularly little , yet what small knowledge of it i was able to gain seemed to depress me much .
perhaps it was at first only the manifest reluctance of my old preceptor to discuss with me my paternal ancestry that gave rise to the terror which i ever felt at the mention of my great house , yet as i grew out of childhood , i was able to piece together disconnected fragments of discourse , let slip from the unwilling tongue which had begun to falter in approaching senility , that had a sort of relation to a certain circumstance which i had always deemed strange , but which now became dimly terrible .
the circumstance to which i allude is the early age at which all the counts of my line had met their end .
whilst i had hitherto considered this but a natural attribute of a family of men , i afterward pondered long upon these premature deaths , and began to connect them with the wanderings of the old man , who often spoke of a curse which for centuries had prevented the lives of the holders of my title from much exceeding the span of years .
upon my birthday , the aged pierre gave to me a family document which he said had for many generations been handed down from father to son , and continued by each possessor .
its contents were of the most startling nature , and its perusal confirmed the gravest of my apprehensions .
at this time , my belief in the supernatural was firm and , else i should have dismissed with scorn the incredible narrative unfolded before my eyes .
the paper carried me back to the days of the thirteenth century , when the old castle in which i sat had been a feared and impregnable fortress .
it told of a certain ancient man who had once dwelled on our estates , a person of no small accomplishments , though little above the rank of peasant , by name , michel , usually designated by the surname of mauvais , the evil , on account of his sinister reputation .
he had studied beyond the custom of his kind , seeking such things as the philosopher stone or the elixir of eternal life , and was reputed wise in the terrible secrets of black magic and alchemy .
michel mauvais had one son , named charles , a youth as proficient as himself in the hidden arts , who had therefore been called le sorcier , or the wizard .
this pair , shunned by all honest folk , were suspected of the most hideous practices .
old michel was said to have burnt his wife alive as a sacrifice to the devil , and the unaccountable disappearance of many small peasant children was laid at the dreaded door of these two .
yet through the dark natures of the father and son ran one redeeming ray of humanity ; the evil old man loved his offspring with fierce intensity , whilst the youth had for his parent a more than filial affection .
one night the castle on the hill was thrown into the wildest confusion by the vanishment of young godfrey , son to henri , the count .
a searching party , headed by the frantic father , invaded the cottage of the sorcerers and there came upon old michel mauvais , busy over a huge and violently boiling cauldron .
without certain cause , in the ungoverned madness of fury and despair , the count laid hands on the aged wizard , and ere he released his murderous hold , his victim was no more .
meanwhile , joyful servants were proclaiming the finding of young godfrey in a distant and unused chamber of the great edifice , telling too late that poor michel had been killed in vain .
as the count and his associates turned away from the lowly abode of the alchemist , the form of charles le sorcier appeared through the trees .
the excited chatter of the menials standing about told him what had occurred , yet he seemed at first unmoved at his father fate .
then , slowly advancing to meet the count , he pronounced in dull yet terrible accents the curse that ever afterward haunted the house of .
a noble of thy line survive to reach a greater age than thine ! '
spake he , when , suddenly leaping backwards into the black woods , he drew from his tunic a phial of colourless liquid which he threw into the face of his father slayer as he disappeared behind the inky curtain of the night .
the count died without utterance , and was buried the next day , but little more than two and thirty years from the hour of his birth .
no trace of the assassin could be found , though relentless bands of peasants scoured the neighboring woods and the meadowland around the hill .
thus time and the want of a reminder dulled the memory of the curse in the minds of the late count family , so that when godfrey , innocent cause of the whole tragedy and now bearing the title , was killed by an arrow whilst hunting at the age of , there were no thoughts save those of grief at his demise .
but when , years afterward , the next young count , robert by name , was found dead in a nearby field of no apparent cause , the peasants told in whispers that their seigneur had but lately passed his birthday when surprised by early death .
louis , son to robert , was found drowned in the moat at the same fateful age , and thus down through the centuries ran the ominous chronicle henris , roberts , antoines , and armands snatched from happy and virtuous lives when little below the age of their unfortunate ancestor at his murder .
that i had left at most but eleven years of further existence was made certain to me by the words which i had read .
my life , previously held at small value , now became dearer to me each day , as i delved deeper and deeper into the mysteries of the hidden world of black magic .
isolated as i was , modern science had produced no impression upon me , and i laboured as in the middle ages , as wrapt as had been old michel and young charles themselves in the acquisition of demonological and alchemical learning .
yet read as i might , in no manner could i account for the strange curse upon my line .
in unusually rational moments i would even go so far as to seek a natural explanation , attributing the early deaths of my ancestors to the sinister charles le sorcier and his heirs ; yet , having found upon careful inquiry that there were no known descendants of the alchemist , i would fall back to occult studies , and once more endeavor to find a spell , that would release my house from its terrible burden .
upon one thing i was absolutely resolved .
i should never wed , for , since no other branch of my family was in existence , i might thus end the curse with myself .
as i drew near the age of thirty , old pierre was called to the land beyond .
alone i buried him beneath the stones of the courtyard about which he had loved to wander in life .
thus was i left to ponder on myself as the only human creature within the great fortress , and in my utter solitude my mind began to cease its vain protest against the impending doom , to become almost reconciled to the fate which so many of my ancestors had met .
much of my time was now occupied in the exploration of the ruined and abandoned halls and towers of the old chateau , which in youth fear had caused me to shun , and some of which old pierre had once told me had not been trodden by human foot for over four centuries .
strange and awesome were many of the objects i encountered .
furniture , covered by the dust of ages and crumbling with the rot of long dampness , met my eyes .
cobwebs in a profusion never before seen by me were spun everywhere , and huge bats flapped their bony and uncanny wings on all sides of the otherwise untenanted gloom .
of my exact age , even down to days and hours , i kept a most careful record , for each movement of the pendulum of the massive clock in the library told off so much of my doomed existence .
at length i approached that time which i had so long viewed with apprehension .
since most of my ancestors had been seized some little while before they reached the exact age of count henri at his end , i was every moment on the watch for the coming of the unknown death .
in what strange form the curse should overtake me , i knew not ; but i was resolved at least that it should not find me a cowardly or a passive victim .
with new vigour i applied myself to my examination of the old chateau and its contents .
it was upon one of the longest of all my excursions of discovery in the deserted portion of the castle , less than a week before that fatal hour which i felt must mark the utmost limit of my stay on earth , beyond which i could have not even the slightest hope of continuing to draw breath that i came upon the culminating event of my whole life .
i had spent the better part of the morning in climbing up and down half ruined staircases in one of the most dilapidated of the ancient turrets .
as the afternoon progressed , i sought the lower levels , descending into what appeared to be either a mediaeval place of confinement , or a more recently excavated storehouse for gunpowder .
as i slowly traversed the passageway at the foot of the last staircase , the paving became very damp , and soon i saw by the light of my flickering torch that a blank , wall impeded my journey .
turning to retrace my steps , my eye fell upon a small trapdoor with a ring , which lay directly beneath my foot .
pausing , i succeeded with difficulty in raising it , whereupon there was revealed a black aperture , exhaling noxious fumes which caused my torch to sputter , and disclosing in the unsteady glare the top of a flight of stone steps .
as soon as the torch which i lowered into the repellent depths burned freely and steadily , i commenced my descent .
the steps were many , and led to a narrow passage which i knew must be far underground .
this passage proved of great length , and terminated in a massive oaken door , dripping with the moisture of the place , and stoutly resisting all my attempts to open it .
ceasing after a time my efforts in this direction , i had proceeded back some distance toward the steps when there suddenly fell to my experience one of the most profound and maddening shocks capable of reception by the human mind .
without warning , i heard the heavy door behind me creak slowly open upon its rusted hinges .
my immediate sensations were incapable of analysis .
to be confronted in a place as thoroughly deserted as i had deemed the old castle with evidence of the presence of man or spirit produced in my brain a horror of the most acute description .
when at last i turned and faced the seat of the sound , my eyes must have started from their orbits at the sight that they beheld .
there in the ancient gothic doorway stood a human figure .
it was that of a man clad in a and long mediaeval tunic of dark colour .
his long hair and flowing beard were of a terrible and intense black hue , and of incredible profusion .
his forehead , high beyond the usual dimensions ; his cheeks , and heavily lined with wrinkles ; and his hands , long , , and gnarled , were of such a deadly whiteness as i have never elsewhere seen in man .
his figure , lean to the proportions of a skeleton , was strangely bent and almost lost within the voluminous folds of his peculiar garment .
but strangest of all were his eyes , twin caves of abysmal blackness , profound in expression of understanding , yet inhuman in degree of wickedness .
these were now fixed upon me , piercing my soul with their hatred , and rooting me to the spot whereon i stood .
at last the figure spoke in a rumbling voice that chilled me through with its dull hollowness and latent malevolence .
the language in which the discourse was clothed was that debased form of latin in use amongst the more learned men of the middle ages , and made familiar to me by my prolonged researches into the works of the old alchemists and demonologists .
the apparition spoke of the curse which had hovered over my house , told me of my coming end , dwelt on the wrong perpetrated by my ancestor against old michel mauvais , and gloated over the revenge of charles le sorcier .
he told how young charles has escaped into the night , returning in after years to kill godfrey the heir with an arrow just as he approached the age which had been his father at his assassination ; how he had secretly returned to the estate and established himself , unknown , in the even then deserted subterranean chamber whose doorway now framed the hideous narrator , how he had seized robert , son of godfrey , in a field , forced poison down his throat , and left him to die at the age of , thus maintaining the foul provisions of his vengeful curse .
at this point i was left to imagine the solution of the greatest mystery of all , how the curse had been fulfilled since that time when charles le sorcier must in the course of nature have died , for the man digressed into an account of the deep alchemical studies of the two wizards , father and son , speaking most particularly of the researches of charles le sorcier concerning the elixir which should grant to him who partook of it eternal life and youth .
his enthusiasm had seemed for the moment to remove from his terrible eyes the black malevolence that had first so haunted me , but suddenly the fiendish glare returned and , with a shocking sound like the hissing of a serpent , the stranger raised a glass phial with the evident intent of ending my life as had charles le sorcier , six hundred years before , ended that of my ancestor .
prompted by some preserving instinct of , i broke through the spell that had hitherto held me immovable , and flung my now dying torch at the creature who menaced my existence .
i heard the phial break harmlessly against the stones of the passage as the tunic of the strange man caught fire and lit the horrid scene with a ghastly radiance .
the shriek of fright and impotent malice emitted by the assassin proved too much for my already shaken nerves , and i fell prone upon the slimy floor in a total faint .
when at last my senses returned , all was frightfully dark , and my mind , remembering what had occurred , shrank from the idea of beholding any more ; yet curiosity all .
who , i asked myself , was this man of evil , and how came he within the castle walls ?
why should he seek to avenge the death of michel mauvais , and how had the curse been carried on through all the long centuries since the time of charles le sorcier ?
the dread of years was lifted from my shoulder , for i knew that he whom i had felled was the source of all my danger from the curse ; and now that i was free , i burned with the desire to learn more of the sinister thing which had haunted my line for centuries , and made of my own youth one nightmare .
determined upon further exploration , i felt in my pockets for flint and steel , and lit the unused torch which i had with me .
first of all , new light revealed the distorted and blackened form of the mysterious stranger .
the hideous eyes were now closed .
disliking the sight , i turned away and entered the chamber beyond the gothic door .
here i found what seemed much like an alchemist laboratory .
in one corner was an immense pile of shining yellow metal that sparkled gorgeously in the light of the torch .
it may have been gold , but i did not pause to examine it , for i was strangely affected by that which i had undergone .
at the farther end of the apartment was an opening leading out into one of the many wild ravines of the dark hillside forest .
filled with wonder , yet now realizing how the man had obtained access to the chateau , i proceeded to return .
i had intended to pass by the remains of the stranger with averted face but , as i approached the body , i seemed to hear emanating from it a faint sound , as though life were not yet wholly extinct .
aghast , i turned to examine the charred and shrivelled figure on the floor .
then all at once the horrible eyes , blacker even than the seared face in which they were set , opened wide with an expression which i was unable to interpret .
the cracked lips tried to frame words which i could not well understand .
once i caught the name of charles le sorcier , and again i fancied that the words ' and ' issued from the twisted mouth .
still i was at a loss to gather the purport of his disconnected speech .
at my evident ignorance of his meaning , the pitchy eyes once more flashed malevolently at me , until , helpless as i saw my opponent to be , i trembled as i watched him .
suddenly the wretch , animated with his last burst of strength , raised his piteous head from the damp and sunken pavement .
then , as i remained , paralyzed with fear , he found his voice and in his dying breath screamed forth those words which have ever afterward haunted my days and nights .
! '
he shrieked , you not guess my secret ?
have you no brain whereby you may recognize the will which has through six long centuries fulfilled the dreadful curse upon the house ?
have i not told you of the great elixir of eternal life ?
know you not how the secret of alchemy was solved ?
i tell you , it is i !
i !
i !
that have lived for six hundred years to maintain my revenge , for i am charles le sorcier ! '
the horrible conclusion which had been gradually intruding itself upon my confused and reluctant mind was now an awful certainty .
i was lost , completely , hopelessly lost in the vast and labyrinthine recess of the mammoth cave .
turn as i might , in no direction could my straining vision seize on any object capable of serving as a guidepost to set me on the outward path .
that nevermore should i behold the blessed light of day , or scan the pleasant hills and dales of the beautiful world outside , my reason could no longer entertain the slightest unbelief .
hope had departed .
yet , indoctrinated as i was by a life of philosophical study , i derived no small measure of satisfaction from my unimpassioned demeanour ; for although i had frequently read of the wild frenzies into which were thrown the victims of similar situations , i experienced none of these , but stood quiet as soon as i clearly realised the loss of my bearings .
nor did the thought that i had probably wandered beyond the utmost limits of an ordinary search cause me to abandon my composure even for a moment .
if i must die , i reflected , then was this terrible yet majestic cavern as welcome a sepulchre as that which any churchyard might afford , a conception which carried with it more of tranquillity than of despair .
starving would prove my ultimate fate ; of this i was certain .
some , i knew , had gone mad under circumstances such as these , but i felt that this end would not be mine .
my disaster was the result of no fault save my own , since unknown to the guide i had separated myself from the regular party of sightseers ; and , wandering for over an hour in forbidden avenues of the cave , had found myself unable to retrace the devious windings which i had pursued since forsaking my companions .
already my torch had begun to expire ; soon i would be enveloped by the total and almost palpable blackness of the bowels of the earth .
as i stood in the waning , unsteady light , i idly wondered over the exact circumstances of my coming end .
i remembered the accounts which i had heard of the colony of consumptives , who , taking their residence in this gigantic grotto to find health from the apparently salubrious air of the underground world , with its steady , uniform temperature , pure air , and peaceful quiet , had found , instead , death in strange and ghastly form .
i had seen the sad remains of their cottages as i passed them by with the party , and had wondered what unnatural influence a long sojourn in this immense and silent cavern would exert upon one as healthy and vigorous as i .
now , i grimly told myself , my opportunity for settling this point had arrived , provided that want of food should not bring me too speedy a departure from this life .
as the last fitful rays of my torch faded into obscurity , i resolved to leave no stone unturned , no possible means of escape neglected ; so , summoning all the powers possessed by my lungs , i set up a series of loud shoutings , in the vain hope of attracting the attention of the guide by my clamour .
yet , as i called , i believed in my heart that my cries were to no purpose , and that my voice , magnified and reflected by the numberless ramparts of the black maze about me , fell upon no ears save my own .
all at once , however , my attention was fixed with a start as i fancied that i heard the sound of soft approaching steps on the rocky floor of the cavern .
was my deliverance about to be accomplished so soon ?
had , then , all my horrible apprehensions been for naught , and was the guide , having marked my unwarranted absence from the party , following my course and seeking me out in this limestone labyrinth ?
whilst these joyful queries arose in my brain , i was on the point of renewing my cries , in order that my discovery might come the sooner , when in an instant my delight was turned to horror as i listened ; for my ever acute ear , now sharpened in even greater degree by the complete silence of the cave , bore to my benumbed understanding the unexpected and dreadful knowledge that these footfalls were not like those of any mortal man .
in the unearthly stillness of this subterranean region , the tread of the booted guide would have sounded like a series of sharp and incisive blows .
these impacts were soft , and stealthy , as of the paws of some feline .
besides , when i listened carefully , i seemed to trace the falls of four instead of two feet .
i was now convinced that i had by my own cries aroused and attracted some wild beast , perhaps a mountain lion which had accidentally strayed within the cave .
perhaps , i considered , the almighty had chosen for me a swifter and more merciful death than that of hunger ; yet the instinct of , never wholly dormant , was stirred in my breast , and though escape from the peril might but spare me for a sterner and more lingering end , i determined nevertheless to part with my life at as high a price as i could command .
strange as it may seem , my mind conceived of no intent on the part of the visitor save that of hostility .
accordingly , i became very quiet , in the hope that the unknown beast would , in the absence of a guiding sound , lose its direction as had i , and thus pass me by .
but this hope was not destined for realisation , for the strange footfalls steadily advanced , the animal evidently having obtained my scent , which in an atmosphere so absolutely free from all distracting influences as is that of the cave , could doubtless be followed at great distance .
seeing therefore that i must be armed for defense against an uncanny and unseen attack in the dark , i groped about me the largest of the fragments of rock which were strewn upon all parts of the floor of the cavern in the vicinity , and grasping one in each hand for immediate use , awaited with resignation the inevitable result .
meanwhile the hideous pattering of the paws drew near .
certainly , the conduct of the creature was exceedingly strange .
most of the time , the tread seemed to be that of a quadruped , walking with a singular lack of unison betwixt hind and fore feet , yet at brief and infrequent intervals i fancied that but two feet were engaged in the process of locomotion .
i wondered what species of animal was to confront me ; it must , i thought , be some unfortunate beast who had paid for its curiosity to investigate one of the entrances of the fearful grotto with a life long confinement in its interminable recesses .
it doubtless obtained as food the eyeless fish , bats and rats of the cave , as well as some of the ordinary fish that are wafted in at every freshet of green river , which communicates in some occult manner with the waters of the cave .
i occupied my terrible vigil with grotesque conjectures of what alteration cave life might have wrought in the physical structure of the beast , remembering the awful appearances ascribed by local tradition to the consumptives who had died after long residence in the cave .
then i remembered with a start that , even should i succeed in felling my antagonist , i should never behold its form , as my torch had long since been extinct , and i was entirely unprovided with matches .
the tension on my brain now became frightful .
my disordered fancy conjured up hideous and fearsome shapes from the sinister darkness that surrounded me , and that actually seemed to press upon my body .
nearer , nearer , the dreadful footfalls approached .
it seemed that i must give vent to a piercing scream , yet had i been sufficiently irresolute to attempt such a thing , my voice could scarce have responded .
i was petrified , rooted to the spot .
i doubted if my right arm would allow me to hurl its missile at the oncoming thing when the crucial moment should arrive .
now the steady pat , pat , of the steps was close at hand ; now very close .
i could hear the laboured breathing of the animal , and as i was , i realised that it must have come from a considerable distance , and was correspondingly fatigued .
suddenly the spell broke .
my right hand , guided by my ever trustworthy sense of hearing , threw with full force the bit of limestone which it contained , toward that point in the darkness from which emanated the breathing and pattering , and , wonderful to relate , it nearly reached its goal , for i heard the thing jump , landing at a distance away , where it seemed to pause .
having readjusted my aim , i discharged my second missile , this time most effectively , for with a flood of joy i listened as the creature fell in what sounded like a complete collapse and evidently remained prone and unmoving .
almost overpowered by the great relief which rushed over me , i reeled back against the wall .
the breathing continued , in heavy , gasping inhalations and expirations , whence i realised that i had no more than wounded the creature .
and now all desire to examine the thing ceased .
at last something allied to groundless , superstitious fear had entered my brain , and i did not approach the body , nor did i continue to cast stones at it in order to complete the extinction of its life .
instead , i ran at full speed in what was , as nearly as i could estimate in my frenzied condition , the direction from which i had come .
suddenly i heard a sound or rather , a regular succession of sounds .
in another instant they had resolved themselves into a series of sharp , metallic clicks .
this time there was no doubt .
it was the guide .
and then i shouted , yelled , screamed , even shrieked with joy as i beheld in the vaulted arches above the faint and glimmering effulgence which i knew to be the reflected light of an approaching torch .
i ran to meet the flare , and before i could completely understand what had occurred , was lying upon the ground at the feet of the guide , embracing his boots and gibbering , despite my boasted reserve , in a most meaningless and idiotic manner , pouring out my terrible story , and at the same time overwhelming my auditor with protestations of gratitude .
at length , i awoke to something like my normal consciousness .
the guide had noted my absence upon the arrival of the party at the entrance of the cave , and had , from his own intuitive sense of direction , proceeded to make a thorough canvass of just ahead of where he had last spoken to me , locating my whereabouts after a quest of about four hours .
by the time he had related this to me , i , emboldened by his torch and his company , began to reflect upon the strange beast which i had wounded but a short distance back in the darkness , and suggested that we ascertain , by the flashlight aid , what manner of creature was my victim .
accordingly i retraced my steps , this time with a courage born of companionship , to the scene of my terrible experience .
soon we descried a white object upon the floor , an object whiter even than the gleaming limestone itself .
cautiously advancing , we gave vent to a simultaneous ejaculation of wonderment , for of all the unnatural monsters either of us had in our lifetimes beheld , this was in surpassing degree the strangest .
it appeared to be an anthropoid ape of large proportions , escaped , perhaps , from some itinerant menagerie .
its hair was , a thing due no doubt to the bleaching action of a long existence within the inky confines of the cave , but it was also surprisingly thin , being indeed largely absent save on the head , where it was of such length and abundance that it fell over the shoulders in considerable profusion .
the face was turned away from us , as the creature lay almost directly upon it .
the inclination of the limbs was very singular , explaining , however , the alternation in their use which i had before noted , whereby the beast used sometimes all four , and on other occasions but two for its progress .
from the tips of the fingers or toes , long claws extended .
the hands or feet were not prehensile , a fact that i ascribed to that long residence in the cave which , as i before mentioned , seemed evident from the and almost unearthly whiteness so characteristic of the whole anatomy .
no tail seemed to be present .
the respiration had now grown very feeble , and the guide had drawn his pistol with the evident intent of despatching the creature , when a sudden sound emitted by the latter caused the weapon to fall unused .
the sound was of a nature difficult to describe .
it was not like the normal note of any known species of simian , and i wonder if this unnatural quality were not the result of a long continued and complete silence , broken by the sensations produced by the advent of the light , a thing which the beast could not have seen since its first entrance into the cave .
the sound , which i might feebly attempt to classify as a kind of chattering , was faintly continued .
all at once a fleeting spasm of energy seemed to pass through the frame of the beast .
the paws went through a convulsive motion , and the limbs contracted .
with a jerk , the white body rolled over so that its face was turned in our direction .
for a moment i was so struck with horror at the eyes thus revealed that i noted nothing else .
they were black , those eyes , deep jetty black , in hideous contrast to the snow white hair and flesh .
like those of other cave denizens , they were deeply sunken in their orbits , and were entirely destitute of iris .
as i looked more closely , i saw that they were set in a face less prognathous than that of the average ape , and infinitely less hairy .
the nose was quite distinct .
as we gazed upon the uncanny sight presented to our vision , the thick lips opened , and several sounds issued from them , after which the thing relaxed in death .
the guide clutched my coat sleeve and trembled so violently that the light shook fitfully , casting weird moving shadows on the walls .
i made no motion , but stood rigidly still , my horrified eyes fixed upon the floor ahead .
the fear left , and wonder , awe , compassion , and reverence succeeded in its place , for the sounds uttered by the stricken figure that lay stretched out on the limestone had told us the awesome truth .
the creature i had killed , the strange beast of the unfathomed cave , was , or had at one time been a ! ! !
my memories are very confused .
there is even much doubt as to where they begin ; for at times i feel appalling vistas of years stretching behind me , while at other times it seems as if the present moment were an isolated point in a grey , formless infinity .
i am not even certain how i am communicating this message .
while i know i am speaking , i have a vague impression that some strange and perhaps terrible mediation will be needed to bear what i say to the points where i wish to be heard .
my identity , too , is bewilderingly cloudy .
i seem to have suffered a great shock perhaps from some utterly monstrous outgrowth of my cycles of unique , incredible experience .
these cycles of experience , of course , all stem from that book .
i remember when i found it in a dimly lighted place near the black , oily river where the mists always swirl .
that place was very old , and the shelves full of rotting volumes reached back endlessly through windowless inner rooms and alcoves .
there were , besides , great formless heaps of books on the floor and in crude bins ; and it was in one of these heaps that i found the thing .
i never learned its title , for the early pages were missing ; but it fell open toward the end and gave me a glimpse of something which sent my senses reeling .
there was a formula a sort of list of things to say and do which i recognized as something black and forbidden ; something which i had read of before in furtive paragraphs of mixed abhorrence and fascination penned by those strange ancient delvers into the universe guarded secrets whose decaying texts i loved to absorb .
it was a key a guide to certain gateways and transitions of which mystics have dreamed and whispered since the race was young , and which lead to freedoms and discoveries beyond the three dimensions and realms of life and matter that we know .
not for centuries had any man recalled its vital substance or known where to find it , but this book was very old indeed .
no , but the hand of some half crazed monk , had traced these ominous latin phrases in uncials of awesome antiquity .
i remember how the old man leered and tittered , and made a curious sign with his hand when i bore it away .
he had refused to take pay for it , and only long afterwards did i guess why .
as i hurried home through those narrow , winding , waterfront streets i had a frightful impression of being stealthily followed by softly padding feet .
the centuried , tottering houses on both sides seemed alive with a fresh and morbid malignity as if some hitherto closed channel of evil understanding had abruptly been opened .
i felt that those walls and gables of mildewed brick and fungoid plaster and timber with eyelike , windows that leered could hardly desist from advancing and crushing me yet i had read only the least fragment of that blasphemous rune before closing the book and bringing it away .
i remember how i read the book at last , and locked in the attic room that i had long devoted to strange searchings .
the great house was very still , for i had not gone up till after midnight .
i think i had a family then though the details are very uncertain and i know there were many servants .
just what the year was i can not say ; for since then i have known many ages and dimensions , and have had all my notions of time dissolved and refashioned .
it was by the light of candles that i read i recall the relentless dripping of the wax and there were chimes that came every now and then from distant belfries .
i seemed to keep track of those chimes with a peculiar intentness , as if i feared to hear some very remote , intruding note among them .
then came the first scratching and fumbling at the dormer window that looked out high above the other roofs of the city .
it came as i droned aloud the ninth verse of that primal lay , and i knew amidst my shudders what it meant .
for he who passes the gateways always wins a shadow , and never again can he be alone .
i had evoked and the book was indeed all i had suspected .
that night i passed the gateway to a vortex of twisted time and vision , and when morning found me in the attic room i saw in the walls and shelves and fittings that which i had never seen before .
nor could i ever after see the world as i had known it .
mixed with the present scene was always a little of the past and a little of the future , and every object loomed alien in the new perspective brought by my widened sight .
from then on i walked in a fantastic dream of unknown and shapes ; and with each new gateway crossed , the less plainly could i recognise the things of the narrow sphere to which i had so long been bound .
what i saw about me , none else saw ; and i grew doubly silent and aloof lest i be thought mad .
dogs had a fear of me , for they felt the outside shadow which never left my side .
but still i read more in hidden , forgotten books and scrolls to which my new vision led me and pushed through fresh gateways of space and being and toward the core of the unknown cosmos .
i remember the night i made the five concentric circles of fire on the floor , and stood in the innermost one chanting that monstrous litany the messenger from tartary had brought .
the walls melted away , and i was swept by a black wind through gulfs of fathomless grey with the pinnacles of unknown mountains miles below me .
after a while there was utter blackness , and then the light of myriad stars forming strange , alien constellations .
finally i saw a plain far below me , and discerned on it the twisted towers of a city built in no fashion i had ever known or read or dreamed of .
as i floated closer to that city i saw a great square building of stone in an open space , and felt a hideous fear clutching at me .
i screamed and struggled , and after a blankness was again in my attic room sprawled flat over the five phosphorescent circles on the floor .
in that night wandering there was no more of strangeness than in many a former night wandering ; but there was more of terror because i knew i was closer to those outside gulfs and worlds than i had ever been before .
thereafter i was more cautious with my incantations , for i had no wish to be cut off from my body and from the earth in unknown abysses whence i could never return
it is said that in ulthar , which lies beyond the river skai , no man may kill a cat ; and this i can verily believe as i gaze upon him who sitteth purring before the fire .
for the cat is cryptic , and close to strange things which men can not see .
he is the soul of antique aegyptus , and bearer of tales from forgotten cities in meroe and ophir .
he is the kin of the jungle lords , and heir to the secrets of hoary and sinister africa .
the sphinx is his cousin , and he speaks her language ; but he is more ancient than the sphinx , and remembers that which she hath forgotten .
in ulthar , before ever the burgesses forbade the killing of cats , there dwelt an old cotter and his wife who delighted to trap and slay the cats of their neighbors .
why they did this i know not ; save that many hate the voice of the cat in the night , and take it ill that cats should run stealthily about yards and gardens at twilight .
but whatever the reason , this old man and woman took pleasure in trapping and slaying every cat which came near to their hovel ; and from some of the sounds heard after dark , many villagers fancied that the manner of slaying was exceedingly peculiar .
but the villagers did not discuss such things with the old man and his wife ; because of the habitual expression on the withered faces of the two , and because their cottage was so small and so darkly hidden under spreading oaks at the back of a neglected yard .
in truth , much as the owners of cats hated these odd folk , they feared them more ; and instead of berating them as brutal assassins , merely took care that no cherished pet or mouser should stray toward the remote hovel under the dark trees .
when through some unavoidable oversight a cat was missed , and sounds heard after dark , the loser would lament impotently ; or console himself by thanking fate that it was not one of his children who had thus vanished .
for the people of ulthar were simple , and knew not whence it is all cats first came .
one day a caravan of strange wanderers from the south entered the narrow cobbled streets of ulthar .
dark wanderers they were , and unlike the other roving folk who passed through the village twice every year .
in the they told fortunes for silver , and bought gay beads from the merchants .
what was the land of these wanderers none could tell ; but it was seen that they were given to strange prayers , and that they had painted on the sides of their wagons strange figures with human bodies and the heads of cats , hawks , rams and lions .
and the leader of the caravan wore a headdress with two horns and a curious disk betwixt the horns .
there was in this singular caravan a little boy with no father or mother , but only a tiny black kitten to cherish .
the plague had not been kind to him , yet had left him this small furry thing to mitigate his sorrow ; and when one is very young , one can find great relief in the lively antics of a black kitten .
so the boy whom the dark people called menes smiled more often than he wept as he sat playing with his graceful kitten on the steps of an oddly painted wagon .
on the third morning of the wanderers ' stay in ulthar , menes could not find his kitten ; and as he sobbed aloud in the certain villagers told him of the old man and his wife , and of sounds heard in the night .
and when he heard these things his sobbing gave place to meditation , and finally to prayer .
he stretched out his arms toward the sun and prayed in a tongue no villager could understand ; though indeed the villagers did not try very hard to understand , since their attention was mostly taken up by the sky and the odd shapes the clouds were assuming .
it was very peculiar , but as the little boy uttered his petition there seemed to form overhead the shadowy , nebulous figures of exotic things ; of hybrid creatures crowned with disks .
nature is full of such illusions to impress the imaginative .
that night the wanderers left ulthar , and were never seen again .
and the householders were troubled when they noticed that in all the village there was not a cat to be found .
from each hearth the familiar cat had vanished ; cats large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white .
old kranon , the burgomaster , swore that the dark folk had taken the cats away in revenge for the killing of menes ' kitten ; and cursed the caravan and the little boy .
but nith , the lean notary , declared that the old cotter and his wife were more likely persons to suspect ; for their hatred of cats was notorious and increasingly bold .
still , no one durst complain to the sinister couple ; even when little atal , the innkeeper son , vowed that he had at twilight seen all the cats of ulthar in that accursed yard under the trees , pacing very slowly and solemnly in a circle around the cottage , two abreast , as if in performance of some rite of beasts .
the villagers did not know how much to believe from so small a boy ; and though they feared that the evil pair had charmed the cats to their death , they preferred not to chide the old cotter till they met him outside his dark and repellent yard .
so ulthar went to sleep in vain anger ; and when the people awakened at dawn behold !
every cat was back at his accustomed hearth !
large and small , black , grey , striped , yellow and white , none was missing .
very sleek and fat did the cats appear , and sonorous with purring content .
the citizens talked with one another of the affair , and marveled not a little .
old kranon again insisted that it was the dark folk who had taken them , since cats did not return alive from the cottage of the ancient man and his wife .
but all agreed on one thing that the refusal of all the cats to eat their portions of meat or drink their saucers of milk was exceedingly curious .
and for two whole days the sleek , lazy cats of ulthar would touch no food , but only doze by the fire or in the sun .
it was fully a week before the villagers noticed that no lights were appearing at dusk in the windows of the cottage under the trees .
then the lean nith remarked that no one had seen the old man or his wife since the night the cats were away .
in another week the burgomaster decided to overcome his fears and call at the strangely silent dwelling as a matter of duty , though in so doing he was careful to take with him shang the blacksmith and thul the cutter of stone as witnesses .
and when they had broken down the frail door they found only this two cleanly picked human skeletons on the earthen floor , and a number of singular beetles crawling in the shadowy corners .
there was subsequently much talk among the burgesses of ulthar .
zath , the coroner , disputed at length with nith , the lean notary ; and kranon and shang and thul were overwhelmed with questions .
even little atal , the innkeeper son , was closely questioned and given a sweetmeat as reward .
they talked of the old cotter and his wife , of the caravan of dark wanderers , of small menes and his black kitten , of the prayer of menes and of the sky during that prayer , of the doings of the cats on the night the caravan left , and of what was later found in the cottage under the dark trees in the repellent yard .
and in the end the burgesses passed that remarkable law which is told of by traders in hatheg and discussed by travelers in nir ; namely , that in ulthar no man may kill a cat .
of the pleasures and pains of opium much has been written .
the ecstasies and horrors of de quincey and the paradis artificiels of baudelaire are preserved and interpreted with an art which makes them immortal , and the world knows well the beauty , the terror and the mystery of those obscure realms into which the inspired dreamer is transported .
but much as has been told , no man has yet dared intimate the nature of the phantasms thus unfolded to the mind , or hint at the direction of the roads along whose ornate and exotic course the partaker of the drug is so irresistibly borne .
de quincey was drawn back into asia , that teeming land of nebulous shadows whose hideous antiquity is so impressive that the vast age of the race and name overpowers the sense of youth in the individual , but farther than that he dared not go .
those who have gone farther seldom returned , and even when they have , they have been either silent or quite mad .
i took opium but once in the year of the plague , when doctors sought to deaden the agonies they could not cure .
there was an overdose my physician was worn out with horror and exertion and i travelled very far indeed .
in the end i returned and lived , but my nights are filled with strange memories , nor have i ever permitted a doctor to give me opium again .
the pain and pounding in my head had been quite unendurable when the drug was administered , of the future i had no heed ; to escape , whether by cure , unconsciousness , or death , was all that concerned me .
i was partly delirious , so that it is hard to place the exact moment of transition , but i think the effect must have begun shortly before the pounding ceased to be painful .
as i have said , there was an overdose ; so my reactions were probably far from normal .
the sensation of falling , curiously dissociated from the idea of gravity or direction , was paramount ; though there was subsidiary impression of unseen throngs in incalculable profusion , throngs of infinitely diverse nature , but all more or less related to me .
sometimes it seemed less as though i were falling , than as though the universe or the ages were falling past me .
suddenly my pain ceased , and i began to associate the pounding with an external rather than internal force .
the falling had ceased also , giving place to a sensation of uneasy , temporary rest ; and when i listened closely , i fancied the pounding was that of the vast , inscrutable sea as its sinister , colossal breakers lacerated some desolate shore after a storm of titanic magnitude .
then i opened my eyes .
for a moment my surroundings seemed confused , like a projected image hopelessly out of focus , but gradually i realised my solitary presence in a strange and beautiful room lighted by many windows .
of the exact nature of the apartment i could form no idea , for my thoughts were still far from settled , but i noticed rugs and draperies , elaborately fashioned tables , chairs , ottomans , and divans , and delicate vases and ornaments which conveyed a suggestion of the exotic without being actually alien .
these things i noticed , yet they were not long uppermost in my mind .
slowly but inexorably crawling upon my consciousness and rising above every other impression , came a dizzying fear of the unknown ; a fear all the greater because i could not analyse it , and seeming to concern a stealthily approaching menace ; not death , but some nameless , unheard of thing inexpressibly more ghastly and abhorrent .
presently i realised that the direct symbol and excitant of my fear was the hideous pounding whose incessant reverberations throbbed maddeningly against my exhausted brain .
it seemed to come from a point outside and below the edifice in which i stood , and to associate itself with the most terrifying mental images .
i felt that some horrible scene or object lurked beyond the walls , and shrank from glancing through the arched , latticed windows that opened so bewilderingly on every hand .
perceiving shutters attached to these windows , i closed them all , averting my eyes from the exterior as i did so .
then , employing a flint and steel which i found on one of the small tables , i lit the many candles reposing about the walls in arabesque sconces .
the added sense of security brought by closed shutters and artificial light calmed my nerves to some degree , but i could not shut out the monotonous pounding .
now that i was calmer , the sound became as fascinating as it was fearful , and i felt a contradictory desire to seek out its source despite my still powerful shrinking .
opening a portiere at the side of the room nearest the pounding , i beheld a small and richly draped corridor ending in a cavern door and large oriel window .
to this window i was irresistibly drawn , though my apprehensions seemed almost equally bent on holding me back .
as i approached it i could see a chaotic whirl of waters in the distance .
then , as i attained it and glanced out on all sides , the stupendous picture of my surroundings burst upon me with full and devastating force .
i beheld such a sight as i had never beheld before , and which no living person can have seen save in the delirium of fever or the inferno of opium .
the building stood on a narrow point of land or what was now a narrow point of land fully three hundred feet above what must lately have been a seething vortex of mad waters .
on either side of the house there fell a newly precipice of red earth , whilst ahead of me the hideous waves were still rolling in frightfully , eating away the land with ghastly monotony and deliberation .
out a mile or more there rose and fell menacing breakers at least fifty feet in height , and on the far horizon ghoulish black clouds of grotesque contour were resting and brooding like unwholesome vultures .
the waves were dark and purplish , almost black , and clutched at the yielding red mud of the bank as if with uncouth , greedy hands .
i could not but feel that some noxious marine mind had declared a war of extermination upon all the solid ground , perhaps abetted by the angry sky .
recovering at length from the stupor into which this unnatural spectacle had thrown me , i realized that my actual physical danger was acute .
even whilst i gazed , the bank had lost many feet , and it could not be long before the house would fall undermined into the awful pit of lashing waves .
accordingly i hastened to the opposite side of the edifice , and finding a door , emerged at once , locking it after me with a curious key which had hung inside .
i now beheld more of the strange region about me , and marked a singular division which seemed to exist in the hostile ocean and firmament .
on each side of the jutting promontory different conditions held sway .
at my left as i faced inland was a gently heaving sea with great green waves rolling peacefully in under a brightly shining sun .
something about that sun nature and position made me shudder , but i could not then tell , and can not tell now , what it was .
at my right also was the sea , but it was blue , calm , and only gently undulating , while the sky above it was darker and the bank more nearly white than reddish .
i now turned my attention to the land , and found occasion for fresh surprise ; for the vegetation resembled nothing i had ever seen or read about .
it was apparently tropical or at least a conclusion borne out by the intense heat of the air .
sometimes i thought i could trace strange analogies with the flora of my native land , fancying that the plants and shrubs might assume such forms under a radical change of climate ; but the gigantic and omnipresent palm trees were plainly foreign .
the house i had just left was very small hardly more than a cottage but its material was evidently marble , and its architecture was weird and composite , involving a quaint fusion of western and eastern forms .
at the corners were corinthian columns , but the red tile roof was like that of a chinese pagoda .
from the door inland there stretched a path of singularly white sand , about four feet wide , and lined on either side with stately palms and unidentifiable flowering shrubs and plants .
it lay toward the side of the promontory where the sea was blue and the bank rather whitish .
down this path i felt impelled to flee , as if pursued by some malignant spirit from the pounding ocean .
at first it was slightly uphill , then i reached a gentle crest .
behind me i saw the scene i had left ; the entire point with the cottage and the black water , with the green sea on one side and the blue sea on the other , and a curse unnamed and unnamable lowering over all .
i never saw it again , and often wonder after this last look i strode ahead and surveyed the inland panorama before me .
the path , as i have intimated , ran along the shore as one went inland .
ahead and to the left i now viewed a magnificent valley comprising thousands of acres , and covered with a swaying growth of tropical grass higher than my head .
almost at the limit of vision was a colossal palm tree which seemed to fascinate and beckon me .
by this time wonder and escape from the imperilled peninsula had largely dissipated my fear , but as i paused and sank fatigued to the path , idly digging with my hands into the warm , sand , a new and acute sense of danger seized me .
some terror in the swishing tall grass seemed added to that of the diabolically pounding sea , and i started up crying aloud and disjointedly , tiger ?
tiger ?
is it tiger ?
beast ?
beast ?
is it a beast that i am afraid of ?
my mind wandered back to an ancient and classical story of tigers which i had read ; i strove to recall the author , but had difficulty .
then in the midst of my fear i remembered that the tale was by rudyard kipling ; nor did the grotesqueness of deeming him an ancient author occur to me ; i wished for the volume containing this story , and had almost started back toward the doomed cottage to procure it when my better sense and the lure of the palm prevented me .
whether or not i could have resisted the backward beckoning without the of the vast palm tree , i do not know .
this attraction was now dominant , and i left the path and crawled on hands and knees down the valley slope despite my fear of the grass and of the serpents it might contain .
i resolved to fight for life and reason as long as possible against all menaces of sea or land , though i sometimes feared defeat as the maddening swish of the uncanny grasses joined the still audible and irritating pounding of the distant breakers .
i would frequently pause and put my hands to my ears for relief , but could never quite shut out the detestable sound .
it was , as it seemed to me , only after ages that i finally dragged myself to the beckoning palm tree and lay quiet beneath its protecting shade .
there now ensued a series of incidents which transported me to the opposite extremes of ecstasy and horror ; incidents which i tremble to recall and dare not seek to interpret .
no sooner had i crawled beneath the overhanging foliage of the palm , than there dropped from its branches a young child of such beauty as i never beheld before .
though ragged and dusty , this being bore the features of a faun or demigod , and seemed almost to diffuse a radiance in the dense shadow of the tree .
it smiled and extended its hand , but before i could arise and speak i heard in the upper air the exquisite melody of singing ; notes high and low blent with a sublime and ethereal harmoniousness .
the sun had by this time sunk below the horizon , and in the twilight i saw an aureole of lambent light encircled the child head .
then in a tone of silver it addressed me it is the end .
they have come down through the gloaming from the stars .
now all is over , and beyond the arinurian streams we shall dwell blissfully in
as the child spoke , i beheld a soft radiance through the leaves of the palm tree , and rising , greeted a pair whom i knew to be the chief singers among those i had heard .
a god and goddess they must have been , for such beauty is not mortal ; and they took my hands , saying , come , child , you have heard the voices , and all is well .
in teloe beyond the milky way and the arinurian streams are cities all of amber and chalcedony .
and upon their domes of many facets glisten the images of strange and beautiful stars .
under the ivory bridges of teloe flow rivers of liquid gold bearing bound for blossomy cytharion of the seven suns .
and in teloe and cytharion abide only youth , beauty , and pleasure , nor are any sounds heard , save of laughter , song , and the lute .
only the gods dwell in teloe of the golden rivers , but among them shalt thou dwell .
as i listened , enchanted , i suddenly became aware of a change in my surroundings .
the palm tree , so lately overshadowing my exhausted form , was now some distance to my left and considerably below me .
i was obviously floating in the atmosphere ; companioned not only by the strange child and the radiant pair , but by a constantly increasing throng of , youths and maidens with hair and joyful countenance .
we slowly ascended together , as if borne on a fragrant breeze which blew not from the earth but from the golden nebulae , and the child whispered in my ear that i must look always upward to the pathways of light , and never backward to the sphere i had just left .
the youths and maidens now chanted mellifluous choriambics to the accompaniment of lutes , and i felt enveloped in a peace and happiness more profound than any i had in life imagined , when the intrusion of a single sound altered my destiny and shattered my soul .
through the ravishing strains of the singers and the lutanists , as if in mocking , daemoniac concord , throbbed from gulfs below the damnable , the detestable pounding of that hideous ocean .
as those black breakers beat their message into my ears i forgot the words of the child and looked back , down upon the doomed scene from which i thought i had escaped .
down through the aether i saw the accursed earth slowly turning , ever turning , with angry and tempestuous seas gnawing at wild desolate shores and dashing foam against the tottering towers of deserted cities .
and under a ghastly moon there gleamed sights i can never describe , sights i can never forget ; deserts of corpselike clay and jungles of ruin and decadence where once stretched the populous plains and villages of my native land , and maelstroms of frothing ocean where once rose the mighty temples of my forefathers .
around the northern pole steamed a morass of noisome growths and miasmal vapours , hissing before the onslaught of the waves that curled and fretted from the shuddering deep .
then a rending report clave the night , and athwart the desert of deserts appeared a smoking rift .
still the black ocean foamed and gnawed , eating away the desert on either side as the rift in the center widened and widened .
there was now no land left but the desert , and still the fuming ocean ate and ate .
all at once i thought even the pounding sea seemed afraid of something , afraid of dark gods of the inner earth that are greater than the evil god of waters , but even if it was it could not turn back ; and the desert had suffered too much from those nightmare waves to help them now .
so the ocean ate the last of the land and poured into the smoking gulf , thereby giving up all it had ever conquered .
from the lands it flowed again , uncovering death and decay ; and from its ancient and immemorial bed it trickled loathsomely , uncovering nighted secrets of the years when time was young and the gods unborn .
above the waves rose weedy remembered spires .
the moon laid pale lilies of light on dead london , and paris stood up from its damp grave to be sanctified with .
then rose spires and monoliths that were weedy but not remembered ; terrible spires and monoliths of lands that men never knew were lands .
there was not any pounding now , but only the unearthly roaring and hissing of waters tumbling into the rift .
the smoke of that rift had changed to steam , and almost hid the world as it grew denser and denser .
it seared my face and hands , and when i looked to see how it affected my companions i found they had all disappeared .
then very suddenly it ended , and i knew no more till i awaked upon a bed of convalescence .
as the cloud of steam from the plutonic gulf finally concealed the entire surface from my sight , all the firmament shrieked at a sudden agony of mad reverberations which shook the trembling aether .
in one delirious flash and burst it happened ; one blinding , deafening holocaust of fire , smoke , and thunder that dissolved the wan moon as it sped outward to the void .
and when the smoke cleared away , and i sought to look upon the earth , i beheld against the background of cold , humorous stars only the dying sun and the pale mournful planets searching for their sister .
writing on what my doctor tells me is my deathbed , my most hideous fear is that the man is wrong .
i suppose i shall seem to be buried next week , but
in london there is a man who screams when the church bells ring .
he lives all alone with his streaked cat in gray inn , and people call him harmlessly mad .
his room is filled with books of the tamest and most puerile kind , and hour after hour he tries to lose himself in their feeble pages .
all he seeks from life is not to think .
for some reason thought is very horrible to him , and anything which stirs the imagination he flees as a plague .
he is very thin and grey and wrinkled , but there are those who declare he is not nearly so old as he looks .
fear has its grisly claws upon him , and a sound will make him start with staring eyes and forehead .
friends and companions he shuns , for he wishes to answer no questions .
those who once knew him as scholar and aesthete say it is very pitiful to see him now .
he dropped them all years ago , and no one feels sure whether he left the country or merely sank from sight in some hidden byway .
it is a decade now since he moved into gray inn , and of where he had been he would say nothing till the night young williams bought the necronomicon .
williams was a dreamer , and only , and when he moved into the ancient house he felt a strangeness and a breath of cosmic wind about the grey wizened man in the next room .
he forced his friendship where old friends dared not force theirs , and marvelled at the fright that sat upon this gaunt , haggard watcher and listener .
for that the man always watched and listened no one could doubt .
he watched and listened with his mind more than with his eyes and ears , and strove every moment to drown something in his ceaseless poring over gay , insipid novels .
and when the church bells rang he would stop his ears and scream , and the grey cat that dwelt with him would howl in unison till the last peal died reverberantly away .
but try as williams would , he could not make his neighbour speak of anything profound or hidden .
the old man would not live up to his aspect and manner , but would feign a smile and a light tone and prattle feverishly and frantically of cheerful trifles ; his voice every moment rising and thickening till at last it would split in a piping and incoherent falsetto .
that his learning was deep and thorough , his most trivial remarks made abundantly clear ; and williams was not surprised to hear that he had been to harrow and oxford .
later it developed that he was none other than lord northam , of whose ancient hereditary castle on the yorkshire coast so many odd things were told ; but when williams tried to talk of the castle , and of its reputed roman origin , he refused to admit that there was anything unusual about it .
he even tittered shrilly when the subject of the supposed , hewn out of the solid crag that frowns on the north sea , was brought up .
so matters went till that night when williams brought home the infamous necronomicon of the mad arab abdul alhazred .
he had known of the dreaded volume since his sixteenth year , when his dawning love of the bizarre had led him to ask queer questions of a bent old bookseller in chandos street ; and he had always wondered why men paled when they spoke of it .
the old bookseller had told him that only five copies were known to have survived the shocked edicts of the priests and lawgivers against it and that all of these were locked up with frightened care by custodians who had ventured to begin a reading of the hateful .
but now , at last , he had not only found an accessible copy but had made it his own at a ludicrously low figure .
it was at a jew shop in the squalid precincts of clare market , where he had often bought strange things before , and he almost fancied the gnarled old levite smiled amidst tangles of beard as the great discovery was made .
the bulky leather cover with the brass clasp had been so prominently visible , and the price was so absurdly slight .
the one glimpse he had had of the title was enough to send him into transports , and some of the diagrams set in the vague latin text excited the tensest and most disquieting recollections in his brain .
he felt it was highly necessary to get the ponderous thing home and begin deciphering it , and bore it out of the shop with such precipitate haste that the old jew chuckled disturbingly behind him .
but when at last it was safe in his room he found the combination of and debased idiom too much for his powers as a linguist , and reluctantly called on his strange , frightened friend for help with the twisted , mediaeval latin .
lord northam was simpering inanities to his streaked cat , and started violently when the young man entered .
then he saw the volume and shuddered wildly , and fainted altogether when williams uttered the title .
it was when he regained his senses that he told his story ; told his fantastic figment of madness in frantic whispers , lest his friend be not quick to burn the accursed book and give wide scattering to its ashes .
there must , lord northam whispered , have been something wrong at the start ; but it would never have come to a head if he had not explored too far .
he was the nineteenth baron of a line whose beginnings went uncomfortably far back into the past unbelievably far , if vague tradition could be heeded , for there were family tales of a descent from times , when a certain lunaeus gabinius capito , military tribune in the third augustan legion then stationed at lindum in roman britain , had been summarily expelled from his command for participation in certain rites unconnected with any known religion .
gabinius had , the rumour ran , come upon a cliffside cavern where strange folk met together and made the elder sign in the dark ; strange folk whom the britons knew not save in fear , and who were the last to survive from a great land in the west that had sunk , leaving only the islands with the roths and circles and shrines of which stonehenge was the greatest .
there was no certainty , of course , in the legend that gabinius had built an impregnable fortress over the forbidden cave and founded a line which pict and saxon , dane and norman were powerless to obliterate ; or in the tacit assumption that from this line sprang the bold companion and lieutenant of the black prince whom edward third created baron of northam .
these things were not certain , yet they were often told ; and in truth the stonework of northam keep did look alarmingly like the masonry of hadrian wall .
as a child lord northam had had peculiar dreams when sleeping in the older parts of the castle , and had acquired a constant habit of looking back through his memory for scenes and patterns and impressions which formed no part of his waking experience .
he became a dreamer who found life tame and unsatisfying ; a searcher for strange realms and relationships once familiar , yet lying nowhere in the visible regions of earth .
filled with a feeling that our tangible world is only an atom in a fabric vast and ominous , and that unknown demesnes press on and permeate the sphere of the known at every point , northam in youth and young manhood drained in turn the founts of formal religion and occult mystery .
nowhere , however , could he find ease and content ; and as he grew older the staleness and limitations of life became more and more maddening to him .
during the he dabbled in satanism , and at all times he devoured avidly any doctrine or theory which seemed to promise escape from the close vistas of science and the dully unvarying laws of nature .
books like ignatius donnelly commercial account of atlantis he absorbed with zest , and a dozen obscure precursors of charles fort enthralled him with their vagaries .
he would travel leagues to follow up a furtive village tale of abnormal wonder , and once went into the desert of araby to seek a nameless city of faint report , which no man has ever beheld .
there rose within him the tantalising faith that somewhere an easy gate existed , which if one found would admit him freely to those outer deeps whose echoes rattled so dimly at the back of his memory .
it might be in the visible world , yet it might be only in his mind and soul .
perhaps he held within his own brain that cryptic link which would awaken him to elder and future lives in forgotten dimensions ; which would bind him to the stars , and to the infinities and eternities beyond them .
written on december , .
published june in the scot there is in the land of mnar a vast still lake that is fed by no stream , and out of which no stream flows .
ten thousand years ago there stood by its shore the mighty city of sarnath , but sarnath stands there no more .
it is told that in the immemorial years when the world was young , before ever the men of sarnath came to the land of mnar , another city stood beside the lake ; the gray stone city of ib , which was old as the lake itself , and peopled with beings not pleasing to behold .
very odd and ugly were these beings , as indeed are most beings of a world yet inchoate and rudely fashioned .
it is written on the brick cylinders of kadatheron that the beings of ib were in hue as green as the lake and the mists that rise above it ; that they had bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears , and were without voice .
it is also written that they descended one night from the moon in a mist ; they and the vast still lake and gray stone city ib .
however this may be , it is certain that they worshipped a stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great ; before which they danced horribly when the moon was gibbous .
and it is written in the papyrus of ilarnek , that they one day discovered fire , and thereafter kindled flames on many ceremonial occasions .
but not much is written of these beings , because they lived in very ancient times , and man is young , and knows but little of the very ancient living things .
after many eons men came to the land of mnar , dark shepherd folk with their fleecy flocks , who built thraa , ilarnek , and kadatheron on the winding river ai .
and certain tribes , more hardy than the rest , pushed on to the border of the lake and built sarnath at a spot where precious metals were found in the earth .
not far from the gray city of ib did the wandering tribes lay the first stones of sarnath , and at the beings of ib they marveled greatly .
but with their marveling was mixed hate , for they thought it not meet that beings of such aspect should walk about the world of men at dusk .
nor did they like the strange sculptures upon the gray monoliths of ib , for why those sculptures lingered so late in the world , even until the coming men , none can tell ; unless it was because the land of mnar is very still , and remote from most other lands , both of waking and of dream .
as the men of sarnath beheld more of the beings of ib their hate grew , and it was not less because they found the beings weak , and soft as jelly to the touch of stones and arrows .
so one day the young warriors , the slingers and the spearmen and the bowmen , marched against ib and slew all the inhabitants thereof , pushing the queer bodies into the lake with long spears , because they did not wish to touch them .
and because they did not like the gray sculptured monoliths of ib they cast these also into the lake ; wondering from the greatness of the labor how ever the stones were brought from afar , as they must have been , since there is naught like them in the land of mnar or in the lands adjacent .
thus of the very ancient city of ib was nothing spared , save the sea green stone idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the .
this the young warriors took back with them as a symbol of conquest over the old gods and beings of th , and as a sign of leadership in mnar .
but on the night after it was set up in the temple , a terrible thing must have happened , for weird lights were seen over the lake , and in the morning the people found the idol gone and the lying dead , as from some fear unspeakable .
and before he died , had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite with coarse shaky strokes the sign of .
after there were many in sarnath but never was the stone idol found .
and many centuries came and went , wherein sarnath prospered exceedingly , so that only priests and old women remembered what had scrawled upon the altar of chrysolite .
betwixt sarnath and the city of ilarnek arose a caravan route , and the precious metals from the earth were exchanged for other metals and rare cloths and jewels and books and tools for artificers and all things of luxury that are known to the people who dwell along the winding river ai and beyond .
so sarnath waxed mighty and learned and beautiful , and sent forth conquering armies to subdue the neighboring cities ; and in time there sate upon a throne in sarnath the kings of all the land of mnar and of many lands adjacent .
the wonder of the world and the pride of all mankind was sarnath the magnificent .
of polished marble were its walls , in height three hundred cubits and in breadth , so that chariots might pass each other as men drove them along the top .
for full five hundred stadia did they run , being open only on the side toward the lake where a green stone kept back the waves that rose oddly once a year at the festival of the destroying of ib .
in sarnath were fifty streets from the lake to the gates of the caravans , and fifty more intersecting them .
with onyx were they paved , save those whereon the horses and camels and elephants trod , which were paved with granite .
and the gates of sarnath were as many as the landward ends of the streets , each of bronze , and flanked by the figures of lions and elephants carven from some stone no longer known among men .
the houses of sarnath were of glazed brick and chalcedony , each having its walled garden and crystal lakelet .
with strange art were they builded , for no other city had houses like them ; and travelers from thraa and ilarnek and kadatheron marveled at the shining domes wherewith they were surmounted .
but more marvelous still were the palaces and the temples , and the gardens made by zokkar the olden king .
there were many palaces , the last of which were mightier than any in thraa or ilarnek or kadatheron .
so high were they that one within might sometimes fancy himself beneath only the sky ; yet when lighted with torches dipt in the oil of dother their walls showed vast paintings of kings and armies , of a splendor at once inspiring and stupefying to the beholder .
many were the pillars of the palaces , all of tinted marble , and carven into designs of surpassing beauty .
and in most of the palaces the floors were mosaics of beryl and lapis lazuli and sardonyx and carbuncle and other choice materials , so disposed that the beholder might fancy himself walking over beds of the rarest flowers .
and there were likewise fountains , which cast scented waters about in pleasing jets arranged with cunning art .
outshining all others was the palace of the kings of mnar and of the lands adjacent .
on a pair of golden crouching lions rested the throne , many steps above the gleaming floor .
and it was wrought of one piece of ivory , though no man lives who knows whence so vast a piece could have come .
in that palace there were also many galleries , and many amphitheaters where lions and men and elephants battled at the pleasure of the kings .
sometimes the amphitheaters were flooded with water conveyed from the lake in mighty aqueducts , and then were enacted stirring , or combats betwixt swimmers and deadly marine things .
lofty and amazing were the seventeen temples of sarnath , fashioned of a bright stone not known elsewhere .
a full thousand cubits high stood the greatest among them , wherein the high priests dwelt with a magnificence scarce less than that of the kings .
on the ground were halls as vast and splendid as those of the palaces ; where gathered throngs in worship of and tamash and lobon , the chief gods of sarnath , whose shrines were as the thrones of monarchs .
not like the eikons of other gods were those of and tamash and lobon .
for so close to life were they that one might swear the graceful bearded gods themselves sate on the ivory thrones .
and up unending steps of zircon was the , wherefrom the looked out over the city and the plains and the lake by day ; and at the cryptic moon and significant stars and planets , and their reflections in the lake , at night .
here was done the very secret and ancient rite in detestation of bokrug , the water lizard , and here rested the altar of chrysolite which bore the doom scrawl of .
wonderful likewise were the gardens made by zokkar the olden king .
in the center of sarnath they lay , covering a great space and encircled by a high wall .
and they were surmounted by a mighty dome of glass , through which shone the sun and moon and planets when it was clear , and from which were hung fulgent images of the sun and moon and stars and planets when it was not clear .
in summer the gardens were cooled with fresh odorous breezes skilfully wafted by fans , and in winter they were heated with concealed fires , so that in those gardens it was always spring .
there ran little streams over bright pebbles , dividing meads of green and gardens of many hues , and spanned by a multitude of bridges .
many were the waterfalls in their courses , and many were the hued lakelets into which they expanded .
over the streams and lakelets rode white swans , whilst the music of rare birds chimed in with the melody of the waters .
in ordered terraces rose the green banks , adorned here and there with bowers of vines and sweet blossoms , and seats and benches of marble and porphyry .
and there were many small shrines and temples where one might rest or pray to small gods .
each year there was celebrated in sarnath the feast of the destroying of ib , at which time wine , song , dancing , and merriment of every kind abounded .
great honors were then paid to the shades of those who had annihilated the odd ancient beings , and the memory of those beings and of their elder gods was derided by dancers and lutanists crowned with roses from the gardens of zokkar .
and the kings would look out over the lake and curse the bones of the dead that lay beneath it .
at first the liked not these festivals , for there had descended amongst them queer tales of how the eikon had vanished , and how had died from fear and left a warning .
and they said that from their high tower they sometimes saw lights beneath the waters of the lake .
but as many years passed without calamity even the priests laughed and cursed and joined in the orgies of the feasters .
indeed , had they not themselves , in their high tower , often performed the very ancient and secret rite in detestation of bokrug , the ?
and a thousand years of riches and delight passed over sarnath , wonder of the world .
gorgeous beyond thought was the feast of the thousandth year of the destroying of ib .
for a decade had it been talked of in the land of mnar , and as it drew nigh there came to sarnath on horses and camels and elephants men from thraa , ilarnek , and kadetheron , and all the cities of mnar and the lands beyond .
before the marble walls on the appointed night were pitched the pavilions of princes and the tents of travelers .
within his reclined , the king , drunken with ancient wine from the vaults of conquered pnoth , and surrounded by feasting nobles and hurrying slaves .
there were eaten many strange delicacies at that feast ; peacocks from the distant hills of linplan , heels of camels from the bnazic desert , nuts and spices from sydathrian groves , and pearls from mtal dissolved in the vinegar of thraa .
of sauces there were an untold number , prepared by the subtlest cooks in all mnar , and suited to the palate of every feaster .
but most prized of all the viands were the great fishes from the lake , each of vast size , and served upon golden platters set with rubies and diamonds .
whilst the king and his nobles feasted within the palace , and viewed the crowning dish as it awaited them on golden platters , others feasted elsewhere .
in the tower of the great temple the priests held revels , and in pavilions without the walls the princes of neighboring lands made merry .
and it was the who first saw the shadows that descended from the gibbous moon into the lake , and the damnable green mists that arose from the lake to meet the moon and to shroud in a sinister haze the towers and the domes of fated sarnath .
thereafter those in the towers and without the walls beheld strange lights on the water , and saw that the gray rock akurion , which was wont to rear high above it near the shore , was almost submerged .
and fear grew vaguely yet swiftly , so that the princes of ilarnek and of far rokol took down and folded their tents and pavilions and departed , though they scarce knew the reason for their departing .
then , close to the hour of midnight , all the bronze gates of sarnath burst open and emptied forth a frenzied throng that blackened the plain , so that all the visiting princes and travelers fled away in fright .
for on the faces of this throng was writ a madness born of horror unendurable , and on their tongues were words so terrible that no hearer paused for proof .
men whose eyes were wild with fear shrieked aloud of the sight within the king , where through the windows were seen no longer the forms of and his nobles and slaves , but a horde of indescribable green voiceless things with bulging eyes , pouting , flabby lips , and curious ears ; things which danced horribly , bearing in their paws golden platters set with rubies and diamonds and containing uncouth flames .
and the princes and travelers , as they fled from the doomed city of sarnath on horses and camels and elephants , looked again upon the lake and saw the gray rock akurion was quite submerged .
through all the land of mnar and the land adjacent spread the tales of those who had fled from sarnath , and caravans sought that accursed city and its precious metals no more .
it was long ere any travelers went thither , and even then only the brave and adventurous young men of yellow hair and blue eyes , who are no kin to the men of mnar .
these men indeed went to the lake to view sarnath ; but though they found the vast still lake itself , and the gray rock akurion which rears high above it near the shore , they beheld not the wonder of the world and pride of all mankind .
where once had risen walls of three hundred cubits and towers yet higher , now stretched only the marshy shore , and where once had dwelt fifty million of men now crawled the detestable .
not even the mines of precious metal remained .
had come to sarnath .
but half buried in the rushes was spied a curious green idol ; an exceedingly ancient idol chiseled in the likeness of bokrug , the great .
that idol , enshrined in the high temple at ilarnek , was subsequently worshipped beneath the gibbous moon throughout the land of mnar .
three times randolph carter dreamed of the marvelous city , and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it .
all golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset , with walls , temples , colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble , silver basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens , and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows ; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles .
it was a fever of the gods , a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals .
mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain ; and as carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost vanished memory , the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had been an awesome and momentous place .
he knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme ; though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it , or whether in dream or in waking , he could not tell .
vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth , when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days , and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetic to the eager sound of lutes and song , unclosing fiery gates toward further and surprising marvels .
but each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dream tyrannous gods ; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot , or descend the wide marmoreal fights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning .
when for the third time he awakened with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed , he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown kadath , in the cold waste where no man treads .
but the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting , nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream , and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests of nasht and , whose with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world .
it seemed , however , that his prayers must have been adversely heard , for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city ; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights , and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods .
at length , sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs , nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind , carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before , and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown kadath , veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars , holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the great ones .
in light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests nasht and .
and the priests shook their heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul .
they pointed out that the great ones had shown already their wish , and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas .
they reminded him , too , that not only had no man ever been to kadath , but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie ; whether it be in the dreamlands around our own world , or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of fomalhaut or aldebaran .
if in our dreamland , it might conceivably be reached , but only three human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands , and of that three , two had come back quite mad .
there were , in such voyages , incalculable local dangers ; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe , where no dreams reach ; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinity the boundless daemon sultan azathoth , whose name no lips dare speak aloud , and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable , unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled , maddening beating of vile drums and the thin , monotonous whine of accursed flutes ; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly , awkwardly , and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods , the blind , voiceless , tenebrous , mindless other gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
of these things was carter warned by the priests nasht and in the cavern of flame , but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown kadath in the cold waste , wherever that might be , and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city .
he knew that his journey would be strange and long , and that the great ones would be against it ; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him .
so asking a formal blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course , he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the gate of deeper slumber and set out through the enchanted wood .
in the tunnels of that twisted wood , whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi , dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs ; who know many obscure secrets of the dream world and a few of the waking world , since the wood at two places touches the lands of men , though it would be disastrous to say where .
certain unexplained rumours , events , and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access , and it is well that they can not travel far outside the world of dreams .
but over the nearer parts of the dream world they pass freely , flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love .
most of them live in burrows , but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees ; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat , either physical or spiritual , for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out .
carter , however , had no fear ; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them ; having found through their help the splendid city of celephais in beyond the tanarian hills , where reigns half the year the great king kuranes , a man he had known by another name in life .
kuranes was the one soul who had been to the and returned free from madness .
threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks , carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs , and listened now and then for responses .
he remembered one particular village of the creatures was in the centre of the wood , where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a cleaning tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten , and toward this spot he hastened .
he traced his way by the grotesque fungi , which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed .
finally the great light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight .
this was the nearest of the great ring of stones , and carter knew he was close to the zoog village .
renewing his fluttering sound , he waited patiently ; and was at last rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him .
it was the zoogs , for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small , slippery brown outlines .
out they swarmed , from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree , till the whole region was alive with them .
some of the wilder ones brushed carter unpleasantly , and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear ; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders .
the council of sages , recognizing the visitor , offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others , which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon ; and as carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began .
the zoogs did not , unfortunately , know where the peak of kadath lies , nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dream world or in another .
rumours of the great ones came equally from all points ; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys , since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath .
then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing by the others ; and said that in ulthar , beyond the river skai , there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old pnakotic manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal gnophkehs overcame olathoe and slew all the heroes of the land of lomar .
those manuscripts he said , told much of the gods , and besides , in ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods , and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight .
he had failed , though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly .
so randolph carter thanked the zoogs , who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of wine to take with him , and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side , where the rushing skai flows down from the slopes of lerion , and hatheg and nir and ulthar dot the plain .
behind him , furtive and unseen , crept several of the curious zoogs ; for they wished to learn what might befall him , and bear back the legend to their people .
the vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village , and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat , standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers .
there he would turn sharply aside , for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor ; and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide .
remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks , and what it was possibly set up for , the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring ; for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead , and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberately .
carter detoured at the proper place , and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs .
he had known they would follow him , so he was not disturbed ; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures .
it was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood , and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning .
over fertile plains rolling down to the skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys , and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land .
once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water , and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind .
at another house , where people were stirring , he asked questions about the gods , and whether they danced often upon lerion ; but the farmer and his wife would only make the elder sign and tell him the way to nir and ulthar .
at noon he walked through the one broad high street of nir , which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction ; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the skai , into whose central piece the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it years before .
once on the other side , the frequent presence of cats ( who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs ) revealed the near neighborhood of ulthar ; for in ulthar , according to an ancient and significant law , no man may kill a cat .
very pleasant were the suburbs of ulthar , with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms ; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself , with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough .
carter , the cats being somewhat dispersed by the zoogs , picked his way directly to the modest temple of the elder ones where the priests and old records were said to be ; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stone which crowns ulthar highest hill he sought out the patriarch atal , who had been up the forbidden peak in the stony desert and had come down again alive .
atal , seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple , was fully three centuries old ; but still very keen of mind and memory .
from him carter learned many things about the gods , but mainly that they are indeed only earth gods , ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere .
they might , atal said , heed a man prayer if in good humour ; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop kadath in the cold waste .
it was lucky that no man knew where kadath towers , for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave .
atal companion banni the wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of .
with unknown kadath , if ever found , matters would be much worse ; for although earth gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal , they are protected by the other gods from outside , whom it is better not to discuss .
at least twice in the world history the other gods set their seal upon earth primal granite ; once in antediluvian times , as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the pnakotic manuscripts too ancient to be read , and once on when barzai the wise tried to see earth gods dancing by moonlight .
so , atal said , it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers .
carter , though disappointed by atal discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the pnakotic manuscripts and the seven cryptical books of hsan , did not wholly despair .
first he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace , thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods ' aid ; but atal could tell him nothing .
probably , atal said , the place belonged to his especial dream world and not to the general land of vision that many know ; and conceivably it might be on another planet .
in that case earth gods could not guide him if they would .
but this was not likely , since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the great ones wished to hide from him .
then carter did a wicked thing , offering his guileless host so many draughts of the which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative .
robbed of his reserve , poor atal babbled freely of forbidden things ; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain ngranek , on the isle of oriab in the southern sea , and hinting that it may be a likeness which earth gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain .
and he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange , so that one might easily recognize them , and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods .
now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to carter .
it is known that in disguise the younger among the great ones often espouse the daughters of men , so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands kadath the peasants must all bear their blood .
this being so , the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on ngranek and mark the features ; then , having noted them with care , to search for such features among living men .
where they are plainest and thickest , there must the gods dwell nearest ; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands kadath .
much of the great ones might be learnt in such regions , and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker .
they might not know their parentage , for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly ; a thing which carter realized even as he sought to scale kadath .
but they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows , and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in the dreamland that common folk would call them fools ; and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of kadath , or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret .
and more , one might in certain cases seize some child of a god as hostage ; or even capture some young god himself , disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his bride .
atal , however , did not know how to find ngranek on its isle of oriab ; and recommended that carter follow the singing skai under its bridges down to the southern sea ; where no burgess of ulthar has ever been , but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and carts .
there is a great city there , , but in ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore .
the traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human , or nearly so , but the rowers are never beheld ; and it is not thought wholesome in ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers can not be exhibited .
by the time he had given this information atal was very drowsy , and carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest .
as he turned to go , he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him , and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit .
then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto , and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard , in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priest conversation .
he recalled , too , the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside .
and because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens , he stooped and petted the sleek cats of ulthar as they licked their chops , and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no farther .
it was sunset now , so carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town .
and as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond , all mellow and magical in the slanted light , he swore that ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always , were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one onward toward unknown perils .
then twilight fell , and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic , and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows .
and sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above , and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the skai .
with the night came song , and carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tesselated courts of simple ulthar .
and there might have been sweetness even in the voices of ulthar many cats , but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting .
some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moon dark side , whither the cats leap from tall housetops , but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in carter lap to purr and play , and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant , drowsy herbs .
in the morning carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for dylath leen with the spun wool of ulthar and the cabbages of ulthar busy farms .
and for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the skai ; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns , and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmen songs came from the placid river .
the country was very beautiful , with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills .
on the seventh day a blur of smoke rose on the horizon ahead , and then the tall black towers of , which is built mostly of basalt .
with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the giant causeway , and its streets are dark and uninviting .
there are many dismal near the myriad wharves , and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth .
carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of ngranek on the isle of oriab , and found that they knew of it well .
ships came from baharna on that island , one being due to return thither in only a month , and ngranek is but two days ' from that port .
but few had seen the stone face of the god , because it is on a very difficult side of ngranek , which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava .
once the gods were angered with men on that side , and spoke of the matter to the other gods .
it was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in sea taverns , because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys .
one of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore , and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock .
the mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide , and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste .
and their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the six kingdoms .
but worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers .
those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable , and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded , yet to give no glimpse of its crew .
it was not fair to the of , or to the grocers and butchers , either ; for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard .
the merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from parg across the river .
that was all they ever took , those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers ; never anything from the butchers and grocers , but only gold and the fat black men of parg whom they bought by the pound .
and the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described .
only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old bear them .
dylath leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere , but no mine in all barth dreamland was known to produce their like .
of these things cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst carter waited patiently for the ship from baharna , which might bear him to the isle whereon carven ngranek towers lofty and barren .
meanwhile he did not fall to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset .
of these things , however , he learned nothing ; though he once thought that a certain old merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of .
this man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of leng , which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar .
he was even rumoured to have dealt with that not to be described , which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery .
that such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted , but carter soon found that it was no use questioning him .
then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt wale and the tall lighthouse , silent and alien , and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town .
uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront , and after a while the dark wide mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped steathily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers .
carter observed them closely , and disliked them more the longer he looked at them .
then he saw them drive the stout black men of parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley , and wondered in what lands or if in any lands at all those fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve .
and on the third evening of that galley stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him , smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of carter quest .
he appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling ; and although the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful , carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked .
he bade him therefore be his guest in locked chambers above , and drew out the last of the zoogs ' to loosen his tongue .
the strange merchant drank heavily , but smirked unchanged by the draught .
then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own , and carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby , grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended .
he offered his wine to his host , and though carter took only the least sip , he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles .
all the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly , and as carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth .
carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent like awning on the deck of a ship , with the marvellous coasts of the southern sea flying by in unnatural swiftness .
he was not chained , but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby , and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches .
he saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a of earth a in ancient kingsport had often discoursed in the old days , and recognized the templed terraces of zak , abode of forgotten dreams ; the spires of infamous thalarion , that of a thousand wonders where the eidolon lathi reigns ; the charnel gardens of zura , land of pleasures unattained , and the twin headlands of crystal , meeting above in a resplendent arch , which guard the harbour of , blessed land of fancy .
past all these gorgeous lands the malodourous ship flew unwholesomely , urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below .
and before the day was done carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the basalt pillars of the west , beyond which simple folk say splendid cathuria lies , but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earth dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon sultan azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the other gods , blind , voiceless , tenebrous , and mindless , with their soul and messenger nyarlathotep .
meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent , though carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest .
it is understood in the land of dream that the other gods have many agents moving among men ; and all these agents , whether wholly human or slightly less than human , are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
so carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans , hearing of his daring search for the great ones in their castle of kadath , had decided to take him away and deliver him to nyarlathotep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize .
what might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside , carter could not guess ; nor could he imagine at what hellish they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward .
he knew , however , that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon azathoth in the formless central void .
at the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates .
then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around .
but when they gave carter a portion , he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it ; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him .
and again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath , and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derived .
it was dark when the galley passed betwixt the basalt pillars of the west and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead .
and the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars , and the deck grew damp , and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink .
then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken , and carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and into planetary space .
never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether , leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass , and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity .
these are the nameless larvae of the other gods , and like them are blind and without mind , and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts .
but that offensive galley did not aim as far as carter had feared , for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon .
the moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it , and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably .
the ship made for the edge , and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from earth , and which no fully human person , save perhaps the dreamer , has ever beheld .
the close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to carter , and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there .
the dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no suitable or wholesome gods , and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to be some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution .
and what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been , carter steadily refused to conjecture .
when the ship rounded the edge , and sailed over those lands unseen by man , there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life , and carter saw many low , broad , round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi .
he noticed that these cottages had no windows , and thought that their shape suggested the huts of esquimaux .
then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea , and knew that the voyage was once more to be by water or at least through some liquid .
the galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound , and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to carter .
they now slid along at great speed , once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form , but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and even though the sun shone scorchingly in it .
there presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a coast , and carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city .
the way they leaned and bent , the manner in which they were clustered , and the fact that they had no windows at all , was very disturbing to the prisoner ; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban .
as the coast drew nearer , and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger , he saw upon the jagged hills many forests , some of whose trees he recognized as akin to that solitary in the enchanted wood of earth , from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their curious wine .
carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead , and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them .
for they were not men at all , or even approximately men , but great slippery things which could expand and contract at will , and whose principal shape though it often changed was that of a sort of toad without any eyes , but with a curious vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt , vague snout .
these objects were waddling busily about the wharves , moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength , and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their forepaws .
and now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves , which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in ; only these herds , being without turbans or shoes or clothing , did not seem so very human after all .
some of the slaves the fatter ones , whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentally were unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into the low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans .
once a van was hitched and driven off , and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that carter gasped , even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place .
now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley , followed by a great crew of the slippery as officers , navigators , and rowers .
and carter saw that the almost human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength , such as steering and cooking , fetching and carrying , and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded .
these creatures must have been convenient on earth , for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned , and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations .
but most of them , unless lean or , were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things .
occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated ; some very like these , some not so similar , and some not similar at all .
and he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays .
when the galley landed at a quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of wiggled out of the hatches , and two of them seized carter and dragged him ashore .
the smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling , and carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows .
at length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness .
it was , apparently , all one to the whether it were light or dark .
the odour of the place was intolerable , and when carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions .
it was circular , and about twenty feet across .
from then on time ceased to exist .
at intervals food was pushed in , but carter would not touch it .
what his fate would be , he did not know ; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinity other gods , the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
finally , after an unguessed span of hours or days , the great stone door swung wide again , and carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the streets of that fearsome city .
it was night on the moon , and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches .
in a detestable square a sort of procession was formed ; ten of the and almost human , eleven on either side , and one each before and behind .
carter was placed in the middle of the line ; five ahead and five behind , and one on either side of him .
certain of the produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds .
to that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi , soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city .
that on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited , carter could not doubt ; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over .
the whining of those impious flutes was shocking , and he would have given worlds for some even sound ; but these had no voices , and the slaves did not talk .
then through that darkness there did come a normal sound .
it rolled from the higher hills , and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus .
it was the midnight yell of the cat , and carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats , and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally , springing from high housetops .
verily , it is to the moon dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows , and here amidst that column of foetid things carter heard their homely , friendly cry , and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home .
now much of the speech of cats was known to randolph carter , and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable .
but that he need not have done , for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer , and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions .
the call of the clan had been given , and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it .
the flutes stopped , and there were shrieks in the night .
dying screamed , and cats spit and yowled and roared , but the made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi .
it was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted , and carter had never before seen so many cats .
black , grey , and white ; yellow , tiger , and mixed ; common , persian , and marix ; thibetan , angora , and egyptian ; all were there in the fury of battle , and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of bubastis .
they would leap seven strong at the throat of an or the pink tentacled snout of a and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain , where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine .
carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave , but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders .
then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors , and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray .
at last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes , and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene .
the great shining disc of the earth , thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it , had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape ; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array .
circle on circle they reached , and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly .
of the dead slaves and there were not many signs , but carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the warriors .
carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats , and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate .
he had not been unmarked in ulthar when he passed through , and the sleek old cats had remembered how he patted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten .
and they recalled , too , how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn , and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left .
the grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled , for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognized the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dream .
a yowl now came from the farther peak , and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation .
it was one of the army outposts , stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earth cats fear ; the very large and peculiar cats from saturn , who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moon dark side .
they are leagued by treaty with the evil , and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats ; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter .
after a brief consultation of generals , the cats rose and assumed a closer formation , crowding protectingly around carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland .
the old advised carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers , and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed .
he also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired , and carter decided on the city of whence the black galley had set out ; for he wished to sail thence for oriab and the carven crest ngranek , and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys , if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off .
then , upon a signal , the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst ; while in a black cave on an unhallowed summit of the still vainly waited the crawling chaos nyarlathotep .
the leap of the cats through space was very swift ; and being surrounded by his companions carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss .
before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at , and the stealthy , friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams .
the old leader from ulthar was the last to leave , and as carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow .
when dawn came , carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving .
there was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward oriab , and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways .
most of the townsfolk believed him ; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the merchants .
if aught of evil ever befalls through such traffick , it will not be his fault .
in about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black wale and tall lighthouse , and carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men , with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes .
her cargo was the fragrant resin of oriab inner groves , and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of baharna , and the strange little figures carved from ngranek ancient lava .
for this they were paid in the wool of ulthar and the iridescent textiles of hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in parg .
carter made arrangements with the captain to go to baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days .
and during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of ngranek , and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon ; but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava gatherers and in baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it .
the captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face , for the wrong side of ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister , and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the .
but the captain did not wish to say just what a might be like , since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them .
then carter asked that captain about unknown kadath in the cold waste , and the marvellous sunset city , but of these the good man could truly tell nothing .
carter sailed out of one early morning when the tide turned , and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town .
and for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts , and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying .
but on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of water was stronger , and soon passed from sight of any land .
on the fifth day the sailors were nervous , but the captain apologized for their fears , saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory , and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it .
