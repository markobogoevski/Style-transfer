this , my last boon , give me , for such kindness must relieve me , that you aptly will suppose what pageantry , what feats , what shows , what minstrelsy , and pretty din , the regent made in mytilene to greet the king .
so he thrived , that he is promised to be wived to fair marina , but in no wise till he had done his sacrifice , as dian bade whereto being bound , the interim , pray you , all confound .

to perform thy just command , i here confess myself the king of tyre , who , frighted from my country , did wed at pentapolis the fair thaisa .
at sea in childbed died she , but brought forth a call marina , who , o goddess , wears yet thy silver livery .
she at tarsus was nursed with cleon , who at fourteen years he sought to murder but her better stars brought her to mytilene , whose shore riding , her fortunes brought the maid aboard us , where , by her own most clear remembrance , she made known herself my daughter .
voice and favour !
you are , you are o royal pericles !
faints what means the nun ?
she dies !
help , gentlemen !
noble sir , if you have told diana altar true , this is your wife .
reverend appearer , no , i threw her overboard with these very arms .

is most certain .
look to the lady , o , she but .
early in blustering morn this lady was thrown upon this shore .
i oped the coffin , found there rich jewels , recover her , and placed her here in diana temple .
may we see them ?
great sir , they shall be brought you to my house , whither i invite you .
look , thaisa is recovered .
o , let me look !
if he be none of mine , my sanctity will to my sense bend no licentious ear , but curb it , spite of seeing .
o , my lord , are you not pericles ?
like him you spake , like him you are did you not name a tempest , a birth , and death ?
the voice of dead thaisa !
that thaisa am i , supposed dead and drown .
immortal dian !
now i know you better .
when we with tears parted pentapolis , the king my father gave you such a ring .
shows a ring this , this no more , you gods !
your present kindness makes my past miseries sports you shall do well , that on the touching of her lips i may melt and no more be seen .
o , come , be buried a second time within these arms .
my heart leaps to be gone into my mother bosom .
kneels to thaisa look , who kneels here !
flesh of thy flesh , thaisa , thy burden at the sea , and call marina for she was yielded there .
blest , and mine own !
hail , madam , and my queen !
i know you not .
you have heard me say , when i did fly from tyre , i left behind an ancient substitute can you remember what i call the man ?
i have named him oft .
was helicanus then .
still confirmation embrace him , dear thaisa , this is he .
now do i long to hear how you were found , how possibly preserved , and who to thank , besides the gods , for this great miracle .
lord cerimon , my lord , this man , through whom the gods have shown their power , that can from first to last resolve you .
reverend sir , the gods can have no mortal officer more like a god than you .
will you deliver how this dead queen ?
i will , my lord .
beseech you , first go with me to my house , where shall be shown you all was found with her , how she came placed here in the temple , no needful thing omitted .
pure dian , bless thee for thy vision !
i will offer to thee .
thaisa , this prince , the of your daughter , shall marry her at pentapolis .
and now , this ornament makes me look dismal will i clip to form , and what this fourteen years no razor touch , to grace thy , i beautify .
lord cerimon hath letters of good credit , sir , my father dead .
heavens make a star of him !
yet there , my queen , we celebrate their nuptials , and ourselves will in that kingdom spend our following days our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign .
lord cerimon , we do our longing stay to hear the rest untold sir , lead the way .
exeunt enter gower in antiochus and his daughter you have heard of monstrous lust the due and just reward in pericles , his queen and daughter , seen , although assail with fortune fierce and keen , virtue preserved from fell destruction blast , led on by heaven , and crown with joy at last in helicanus may you well descry a figure of truth , of faith , of loyalty in reverend cerimon there well appears the worth that learned charity aye wears for wicked cleon and his wife , when fame had spread their cursed deed , and honour name of pericles , to rage the city turn , that him and his they in his palace burn , the gods for murder seemed so content to punish them , although not done , but meant .
so , on your patience evermore attending , new joy wait on you !
here our play has ending .
exit act i scene london .
king richard ii palace .
enter king richard ii , john of gaunt , with other nobles and attendants old john of gaunt , lancaster , hast thou , according to thy oath and band , brought hither henry hereford thy bold son , here to make good the boisterous late appeal , which then our leisure would not let us hear , against the duke of norfolk , thomas mowbray ?
i have , my liege .
tell me , moreover , hast thou sounded him , if he appeal the duke on ancient malice , or worthily , as a good subject should , on some known ground of treachery in him ?
as near as i could sift him on that argument , on some apparent danger seen in him aim at your highness , no inveterate malice .
then call them to our presence , face to face , and frowning brow to brow , ourselves will hear the accuser and the accused freely speak are they both , and full of ire , in rage deaf as the sea , hasty as fire .
enter henry bolingbroke and thomas mowbray many years of happy days befal my gracious sovereign , my most loving liege !
each day still better other happiness , until the heavens , envying earth good hap , add an immortal title to your crown !
we thank you both yet one but flatters us , as well appeareth by the cause you come , namely to appeal each other of high treason .
cousin of hereford , what dost thou object against the duke of norfolk , thomas mowbray ?
first , heaven be the record to my speech !
in the devotion of a subject love , tendering the precious safety of my prince , and free from other misbegotten hate , come i appellant to this princely presence .
now , thomas mowbray , do i turn to thee , and mark my greeting well , for what i speak my body shall make good upon this earth , or my divine soul answer it in heaven .
thou art a traitor and a miscreant , too good to be so and too bad to live , since the more fair and crystal is the sky , the uglier seem the clouds that in it fly .
once more , the more to aggravate the note , with a foul traitor name stuff i thy throat , and wish , so please my sovereign , ere i move , what my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove .
let not my cold words here accuse my zeal is not the trial of a woman war , the bitter clamour of two eager tongues , can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain , the blood is hot that must be cool for this yet can i not of such tame patience boast as to be hush and nought at all to say first , the fair reverence of your highness curbs me from giving reins and spurs to my free speech , which else would post until it had return these terms of treason doubled down his throat .
setting aside his high blood royalty , and let him be no kinsman to my liege , i do defy him , and i spit at him , call him a slanderous coward and a villain which to maintain i would allow him odds , and meet him , were i tied to run afoot even to the frozen ridges of the alps , or any other ground inhabitable , where ever englishman durst set his foot .
mean time let this defend my loyalty , by all my hopes , most falsely doth he lie .
pale trembling coward , there i throw my gage , disclaiming here the kindred of the king , and lay aside my high blood royalty , which fear , not reverence , makes thee to except .
if guilty dread have left thee so much strength as to take up mine honour pawn , then stoop by that and all the rites of knighthood else , will i make good against thee , arm to arm , what i have spoke , or thou canst worse devise .
i take it up , and by that sword i swear which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder , i answer thee in any fair degree , or chivalrous design of knightly trial and when i mount , alive may i not light , if i be traitor or unjustly fight !
what doth our cousin lay to mowbray charge ?
it must be great that can inherit us so much as of a thought of ill in him .
look , what i speak , my life shall prove it true , that mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles in name of lendings for your highness ' soldiers , the which he hath detain for lewd employments , like a false traitor and injurious villain .
besides i say and will in battle prove , or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge that ever was survey by english eye , that all the treasons for these eighteen years complotted and contrived in this land fetch from false mowbray their first head and spring .
further i say and further will maintain upon his bad life to make all this good , that he did plot the duke of gloucester death , suggest his adversaries , and consequently , like a traitor coward , sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood which blood , like sacrificing abel , cries , even from the tongueless caverns of the earth , to me for justice and rough chastisement , and , by the glorious worth of my descent , this arm shall do it , or this life be spent .
how high a pitch his resolution soars !
thomas of norfolk , what thou to this ?
o , let my sovereign turn away his face and bid his ears a little while be deaf , till i have told this slander of his blood , how god and good men hate so foul a liar .
mowbray , impartial are our eyes and ears were he my brother , nay , my kingdom heir , as he is but my father brother son , now , by my sceptre awe , i make a vow , such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood should nothing privilege him , nor partialize the unstooping firmness of my upright soul he is our subject , mowbray , so art thou free speech and fearless i to thee allow .
then , bolingbroke , as low as to thy heart , through the false passage of thy throat , thou liest .
three parts of that receipt i had for calais disbursed i duly to his highness ' soldiers , the other part reserved i by consent , for that my sovereign liege was in my debt upon remainder of a dear account , since last i went to france to fetch his queen now swallow down that lie .
for gloucester death , i slew him not , but to my own disgrace neglected my sworn duty in that case .
for you , my noble lord of lancaster , the honourable father to my foe once did i lay an ambush for your life , a trespass that doth vex my grieved soul but ere i last received the sacrament i did confess it , and exactly begg your grace pardon , and i hope i had it .
this is my fault as for the rest appeall , it issues from the rancour of a villain , a recreant and most degenerate traitor which in myself i boldly will defend , and interchangeably hurl down my gage upon this overweening traitor foot , to prove myself a loyal gentleman even in the best blood chamber in his bosom .
in haste whereof , most heartily i pray your highness to assign our trial day .
gentlemen , be ruled by me , let purge this choler without letting blood this we prescribe , though no physician , deep malice makes too deep incision , forget , forgive , conclude and be agreed , our doctors say this is no month to bleed .
good uncle , let this end where it begun , we calm the duke of norfolk , you your son .
to be a shall become my age throw down , my son , the duke of norfolk gage .
and , norfolk , throw down his .
when , harry , when ?
obedience bids i should not bid again .
norfolk , throw down , we bid , there is no boot .
myself i throw , dread sovereign , at thy foot .
my life thou shalt command , but not my shame the one my duty owes , but my fair name , despite of death that lives upon my grave , to dark dishonour use thou shalt not have .
i am disgraced , impeach and baffled here , pierced to the soul with slander venom spear , the which no balm can cure but his which breathed this poison .
rage must be withstood give me his gage lions make leopards tame .
yea , but not change his spots take but my shame .
and i resign my gage .
my dear dear lord , the purest treasure mortal times afford is spotless reputation that away , men are but gilded loam or painted clay .
a jewel in a chest is a bold spirit in a loyal breast .
mine honour is my life , both grow in one take honour from me , and my life is done then , dear my liege , mine honour let me try , in that i live and for that will i die .
cousin , throw up your gage , do you begin .
o , god defend my soul from such deep sin !
shall i seem in my father sight ?
or with pale impeach my height before this dastard ?
ere my tongue shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong , or sound so base a parle , my teeth shall tear the slavish motive of recanting fear , and spit it bleeding in his high disgrace , where shame doth harbour , even in mowbray face .
exit john of gaunt we were not born to sue , but to command , which since we can not do to make you friends , be ready , as your lives shall answer it , at coventry , upon saint lambert day there shall your swords and lances arbitrate the swelling difference of your settled hate since we can not atone you , we shall see justice design the victor chivalry .
lord marshal , command our officers at arms be ready to direct these home alarms .
exeunt scene ii .
the duke of lancaster palace .
enter john of gaunt with duchess alas , the part i had in woodstock blood doth more solicit me than your exclaims , to stir against the butchers of his life !
but since correction lieth in those hands which made the fault that we can not correct , put we our quarrel to the will of heaven , who , when they see the hours ripe on earth , will rain hot vengeance on offenders ' heads .
finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur ?
hath love in thy old blood no living fire ?
edward seven sons , whereof thyself art one , were as seven vials of his sacred blood , or seven fair branches springing from one root some of those seven are dried by nature course , some of those branches by the destinies cut , but thomas , my dear lord , my life , my gloucester , one vial full of edward sacred blood , one flourishing branch of his most royal root , is crack , and all the precious liquor spilt , is hack down , and his summer leaves all faded , by envy hand and murder bloody axe .
ah , gaunt , his blood was thine !
that bed , that womb , that metal , that , that fashion thee made him a man , and though thou livest and breathest , yet art thou slain in him thou dost consent in some large measure to thy father death , in that thou seest thy wretched brother die , who was the model of thy father life .
call it not patience , gaunt , it is despair in suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter , thou showest the naked pathway to thy life , teaching stern murder how to butcher thee that which in mean men we intitle patience is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts .
what shall i say ?
to safeguard thine own life , the best way is to venge my gloucester death .
god is the quarrel , for god substitute , his deputy anointed in his sight , hath caused his death the which if wrongfully , let heaven revenge , for i may never lift an angry arm against his minister .
where then , alas , may i complain myself ?
to god , the widow champion and defence .
why , then , i will .
farewell , old gaunt .
thou goest to coventry , there to behold our cousin hereford and fell mowbray fight o , sit my husband wrongs on hereford spear , that it may enter butcher mowbray breast !
or , if misfortune miss the first career , be mowbray sins so heavy in his bosom , they may break his foaming courser back , and throw the rider headlong in the lists , a caitiff recreant to my cousin hereford !
farewell , old gaunt thy sometimes brother wife with her companion grief must end her life .
sister , farewell , i must to coventry as much good stay with thee as go with me !
yet one word more grief boundeth where it falls , not with the empty hollowness , but weight i take my leave before i have begun , for sorrow ends not when it seemeth done .
commend me to thy brother , edmund york .
lo , this is all nay , yet depart not so , though this be all , do not so quickly go , i shall remember more .
bid him ah , what ? with all good speed at plashy visit me .
alack , and what shall good old york there see but empty lodgings and unfurnish walls , unpeopled offices , untrodden stones ?
and what hear there for welcome but my groans ?
therefore commend me , let him not come there , to seek out sorrow that dwells every where .
desolate , desolate , will i hence and die the last leave of thee takes my weeping eye .
exeunt scene iii .
the lists at coventry .
enter the lord marshal and the duke of aumerle my lord aumerle , is harry hereford arm ?
yea , at all points , and longs to enter in .
the duke of norfolk , sprightfully and bold , stays but the summons of the appellant trumpet .
why , then , the champions are prepared , and stay for nothing but his majesty approach .
the trumpets sound , and king richard enters with his nobles , john of gaunt , bushy , bagot , green , and others .
when they are set , enter thomas mowbray in arms , defendant , with a herald marshal , demand of yonder champion the cause of his arrival here in arms ask him his name and orderly proceed to swear him in the justice of his cause .
in god name and the king , say who thou art and why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms , against what man thou comest , and what thy quarrel speak truly , on thy knighthood and thy oath , as so defend thee heaven and thy valour !
my name is thomas mowbray , duke of norfolk , who hither come engaged by my oath which god defend a knight should violate ! both to defend my loyalty and truth to god , my king and my succeeding issue , against the duke of hereford that appeals me and , by the grace of god and this mine arm , to prove him , in defending of myself , a traitor to my god , my king , and me and as i truly fight , defend me heaven !
the trumpets sound .
enter henry bolingbroke , appellant , in armour , with a herald marshal , ask yonder knight in arms , both who he is and why he cometh hither thus plated in habiliments of war , and formally , according to our law , depose him in the justice of his cause .
what is thy name ?
and wherefore comest thou hither , before king richard in his royal lists ?
against whom comest thou ?
and what thy quarrel ?
speak like a true knight , so defend thee heaven !
harry of hereford , lancaster and derby am i , who ready here do stand in arms , to prove , by god grace and my body valour , in lists , on thomas mowbray , duke of norfolk , that he is a traitor , foul and dangerous , to god of heaven , king richard and to me , and as i truly fight , defend me heaven !
on pain of death , no person be so bold or as to touch the lists , except the marshal and such officers appointed to direct these fair designs .
lord marshal , let me kiss my sovereign hand , and bow my knee before his majesty for mowbray and myself are like two men that vow a long and weary pilgrimage , then let us take a ceremonious leave and loving farewell of our several friends .
the appellant in all duty greets your highness , and craves to kiss your hand and take his leave .
we will descend and fold him in our arms .
cousin of hereford , as thy cause is right , so be thy fortune in this royal fight !
farewell , my blood , which if thou shed , lament we may , but not revenge thee dead .
o let no noble eye profane a tear for me , if i be gored with mowbray spear as confident as is the falcon flight against a bird , do i with mowbray fight .
my loving lord , i take my leave of you , of you , my noble cousin , lord aumerle , not sick , although i have to do with death , but lusty , young , and cheerly drawing breath .
lo , as at english feasts , so i regreet the daintiest last , to make the end most sweet o thou , the earthly author of my blood , whose youthful spirit , in me regenerate , doth with a twofold vigour lift me up to reach at victory above my head , add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers , and with thy blessings steel my lance point , that it may enter mowbray waxen coat , and furbish new the name of john a gaunt , even in the lusty havior of his son .
god in thy good cause make thee prosperous !
be swift like lightning in the execution , and let thy blows , doubly redoubled , fall like amazing thunder on the casque of thy adverse pernicious enemy rouse up thy youthful blood , be valiant and live .
mine innocency and saint george to thrive !
however god or fortune cast my lot , there lives or dies , true to king richard throne , a loyal , just and upright gentleman never did captive with a freer heart cast off his chains of bondage and embrace his golden uncontroll enfranchisement , more than my dancing soul doth celebrate this feast of battle with mine adversary .
most mighty liege , and my companion peers , take from my mouth the wish of happy years as gentle and as jocund as to jest go i to fight truth hath a quiet breast .
farewell , my lord securely i espy virtue with valour couched in thine eye .
order the trial , marshal , and begin .
harry of hereford , lancaster and derby , receive thy lance , and god defend the right !
strong as a tower in hope , i cry amen .
go bear this lance to thomas , duke of norfolk .
harry of hereford , lancaster and derby , stands here for god , his sovereign and himself , on pain to be found false and recreant , to prove the duke of norfolk , thomas mowbray , a traitor to his god , his king and him , and dares him to set forward to the fight .
here standeth thomas mowbray , duke of norfolk , on pain to be found false and recreant , both to defend himself and to approve henry of hereford , lancaster , and derby , to god , his sovereign and to him disloyal , courageously and with a free desire attending but the signal to begin .
sound , trumpets , and set forward , combatants .
a charge sounded stay , the king hath thrown his warder down .
let them lay by their helmets and their spears , and both return back to their chairs again withdraw with us and let the trumpets sound while we return these dukes what we decree .
a long flourish draw near , and list what with our council we have done .
for that our kingdom earth should not be soil with that dear blood which it hath fostered , and for our eyes do hate the dire aspect of civil wounds plough up with neighbours ' sword , and for we think the pride of and ambitious thoughts , with envy , set on you to wake our peace , which in our country cradle draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep , which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums , with harsh resounding trumpets ' dreadful bray , and grating shock of wrathful iron arms , might from our quiet confines fright fair peace and make us wade even in our kindred blood , therefore , we banish you our territories you , cousin hereford , upon pain of life , till twice five summers have enrich our fields shall not regreet our fair dominions , but tread the stranger paths of banishment .
your will be done this must my comfort be , sun that warms you here shall shine on me , and those his golden beams to you here lent shall point on me and gild my banishment .
norfolk , for thee remains a heavier doom , which i with some unwillingness pronounce the sly slow hours shall not determinate the dateless limit of thy dear exile , the hopeless word of to return ' breathe i against thee , upon pain of life .
a heavy sentence , my most sovereign liege , and all unlook for from your highness ' mouth a dearer merit , not so deep a maim as to be cast forth in the common air , have i deserved at your highness ' hands .
the language i have learn these forty years , my native english , now i must forego and now my tongue use is to me no more than an unstringed viol or a harp , or like a cunning instrument cased up , or , being open , put into his hands that knows no touch to tune the harmony within my mouth you have engaol my tongue , doubly portcullis with my teeth and lips , and dull unfeeling barren ignorance is made my gaoler to attend on me .
i am too old to fawn upon a nurse , too far in years to be a pupil now what is thy sentence then but speechless death , which robs my tongue from breathing native breath ?
it boots thee not to be compassionate after our sentence plaining comes too late .
then thus i turn me from my country light , to dwell in solemn shades of endless night .
return again , and take an oath with thee .
lay on our royal sword your banish hands , swear by the duty that you owe to god our part therein we banish with yourselves to keep the oath that we administer you never shall , so help you truth and god !
embrace each other love in banishment , nor never look upon each other face , nor never write , regreet , nor reconcile this louring tempest of your hate , nor never by advised purpose meet to plot , contrive , or complot any ill us , our state , our subjects , or our land .
i swear .
and i , to keep all this .
norfolk , so far as to mine enemy by this time , had the king permitted us , one of our souls had wander in the air .
banish this frail sepulchre of our flesh , as now our flesh is banish from this land confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm , since thou hast far to go , bear not along the clogging burthen of a guilty soul .
no , bolingbroke if ever i were traitor , my name be blotted from the book of life , and i from heaven banish as from hence !
but what thou art , god , thou , and i do know , and all too soon , i fear , the king shall rue .
farewell , my liege .
now no way can i stray , save back to england , all the world my way .
exit uncle , even in the glasses of thine eyes i see thy grieved heart thy sad aspect hath from the number of his banish years pluck four away .
to henry bolingbroke six frozen winter spent , return with welcome home from banishment .
how long a time lies in one little word !
four lagging winters and four wanton springs end in a word such is the breath of kings .
i thank my liege , that in regard of me he shortens four years of my son exile but little vantage shall i reap thereby , for , ere the six years that he hath to spend can change their moons and bring their times about my lamp and light shall be extinct with age and endless night , my inch of taper will be burnt and done , and blindfold death not let me see my son .
why uncle , thou hast many years to live .
but not a minute , king , that thou canst give shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow , and pluck nights from me , but not lend a morrow , thou canst help time to furrow me with age , but stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage , thy word is current with him for my death , but dead , thy kingdom can not buy my breath .
thy son is banish upon good advice , whereto thy tongue a gave why at our justice thou then to lour ?
things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour .
you urged me as a judge , but i had rather you would have bid me argue like a father .
o , had it been a stranger , not my child , to smooth his fault i should have been more mild a partial slander sought i to avoid , and in the sentence my own life destroy .
alas , i look when some of you should say , i was too strict to make mine own away , but you gave leave to my unwilling tongue against my will to do myself this wrong .
cousin , farewell , and , uncle , bid him so six years we banish him , and he shall go .
flourish .
exeunt king richard ii and train cousin , farewell what presence must not know , from where you do remain let paper show .
my lord , no leave take i , for i will ride , as far as land will let me , by your side .
o , to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words , that thou no greeting to thy friends ?
i have too few to take my leave of you , when the tongue office should be prodigal to breathe the abundant dolour of the heart .
thy grief is but thy absence for a time .
joy absent , grief is present for that time .
what is six winters ?
they are quickly gone .
to men in joy , but grief makes one hour ten .
call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure .
my heart will sigh when i miscall it so , which finds it an inforced pilgrimage .
the sullen passage of thy weary steps esteem as foil wherein thou art to set the precious jewel of thy home return .
nay , rather , every tedious stride i make will but remember me what a deal of world i wander from the jewels that i love .
must i not serve a long apprenticehood to foreign passages , and in the end , having my freedom , boast of nothing else but that i was a journeyman to grief ?
all places that the eye of heaven visits are to a wise man ports and happy havens .
teach thy necessity to reason thus , there is no virtue like necessity .
think not the king did banish thee , but thou the king .
woe doth the heavier sit , where it perceives it is but faintly borne .
go , say i sent thee forth to purchase honour and not the king exiled thee , or suppose devouring pestilence hangs in our air and thou art flying to a fresher clime look , what thy soul holds dear , imagine it to lie that way thou , not whence thou comest suppose the singing birds musicians , the grass whereon thou the presence strew , the flowers fair ladies , and thy steps no more than a delightful measure or a dance , for gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite the man that mocks at it and sets it light .
o , who can hold a fire in his hand by thinking on the frosty caucasus ?
or cloy the hungry edge of appetite by bare imagination of a feast ?
or wallow naked in december snow by thinking on fantastic summer heat ?
o , no !
the apprehension of the good gives but the greater feeling to the worse fell sorrow tooth doth never rankle more than when he bites , but lanceth not the sore .
come , come , my son , i bring thee on thy way had i thy youth and cause , i would not stay .
then , england ground , farewell , sweet soil , adieu , my mother , and my nurse , that bears me yet !
i wander , boast of this i can , though banish , yet a trueborn englishman .
exeunt scene iv .
the court .
enter king richard ii , with bagot and green at one door , and the duke of aumerle at another we did observe .
cousin aumerle , how far brought you high hereford on his way ?
i brought high hereford , if you call him so , but to the next highway , and there i left him .
and say , what store of parting tears were shed ?
faith , none for me , except the wind , which then blew bitterly against our faces , awaked the sleeping rheum , and so by chance did grace our hollow parting with a tear .
what said our cousin when you parted with him ?
' and , for my heart disdained that my tongue should so profane the word , that taught me craft to counterfeit oppression of such grief that words seem buried in my sorrow grave .
marry , would the word ' have lengthen hours and added years to his short banishment , he should have had a volume of farewells , but since it would not , he had none of me .
he is our cousin , cousin , but is doubt , when time shall call him home from banishment , whether our kinsman come to see his friends .
ourself and bushy , bagot here and green observed his courtship to the common people , how he did seem to dive into their hearts with humble and familiar courtesy , what reverence he did throw away on slaves , wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles and patient underbearing of his fortune , as to banish their affects with him .
off goes his bonnet to an , a brace of draymen bid god speed him well and had the tribute of his supple knee , with , my countrymen , my loving friends , ' as were our england in reversion his , and he our subjects ' next degree in hope .
well , he is gone , and with him go these thoughts .
now for the rebels which stand out in ireland , expedient manage must be made , my liege , ere further leisure yield them further means for their advantage and your highness ' loss .
we will ourself in person to this war and , for our coffers , with too great a court and liberal largess , are grown somewhat light , we are inforced to farm our royal realm , the revenue whereof shall furnish us for our affairs in hand if that come short , our substitutes at home shall have blank charters , whereto , when they shall know what men are rich , they shall subscribe them for large sums of gold and send them after to supply our wants , for we will make for ireland presently .
enter bushy bushy , what news ?
old john of gaunt is grievous sick , my lord , suddenly taken , and hath sent post haste to entreat your majesty to visit him .
where lies he ?
at ely house .
now put it , god , in the physician mind to help him to his grave immediately !
the lining of his coffers shall make coats to deck our soldiers for these irish wars .
come , gentlemen , let all go visit him pray god we may make haste , and come too late !
amen .
exeunt act ii scene ely house .
enter john of gaunt sick , with the duke of york , and c will the king come , that i may breathe my last in wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth ?
vex not yourself , nor strive not with your breath , for all in vain comes counsel to his ear .
o , but they say the tongues of dying men enforce attention like deep harmony where words are scarce , they are seldom spent in vain , for they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain .
he that no more must say is listen more than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose , more are men ends mark than their lives before the setting sun , and music at the close , as the last taste of sweets , is sweetest last , writ in remembrance more than things long past though richard my life counsel would not hear , my death sad tale may yet undeaf his ear .
no , it is stopp with other flattering sounds , as praises , of whose taste the wise are fond , lascivious metres , to whose venom sound the open ear of youth doth always listen , report of fashions in proud italy , whose manners still our tardy apish nation limps after in base imitation .
where doth the world thrust forth a vanity so it be new , there no respect how vile that is not quickly buzzed into his ears ?
then all too late comes counsel to be heard , where will doth mutiny with wit regard .
direct not him whose way himself will choose is breath thou , and that breath wilt thou lose .
methinks i am a prophet new inspired and thus expiring do foretell of him his rash fierce blaze of riot can not last , for violent fires soon burn out themselves , small showers last long , but sudden storms are short , he tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes , with eager feeding food doth choke the feeder light vanity , insatiate cormorant , consuming means , soon preys upon itself .
this royal throne of kings , this scepter isle , this earth of majesty , this seat of mars , this other eden , , this fortress built by nature for herself against infection and the hand of war , this happy breed of men , this little world , this precious stone set in the silver sea , which serves it in the office of a wall , or as a moat defensive to a house , against the envy of less happier lands , this blessed plot , this earth , this realm , this england , this nurse , this teeming womb of royal kings , fear by their breed and famous by their birth , renowned for their deeds as far from home , for christian service and true chivalry , as is the sepulchre in stubborn jewry , of the world ransom , blessed mary son , this land of such dear souls , this dear dear land , dear for her reputation through the world , is now leased out , i die pronouncing it , like to a tenement or pelting farm england , bound in with the triumphant sea whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege of watery neptune , is now bound in with shame , with inky blots and rotten parchment bonds that england , that was wont to conquer others , hath made a shameful conquest of itself .
ah , would the scandal vanish with my life , how happy then were my ensuing death !
enter king richard ii and queen , duke of aumerle , bushy , green , bagot , lord ross , and lord willoughby the king is come deal mildly with his youth , for young hot colts being raged do rage the more .
how fares our noble uncle , lancaster ?
what comfort , man ?
how with aged gaunt ?
o how that name befits my composition !
old gaunt indeed , and gaunt in being old within me grief hath kept a tedious fast , and who abstains from meat that is not gaunt ?
for sleeping england long time have i watch , watching breeds leanness , leanness is all gaunt the pleasure that some fathers feed upon , is my strict fast , i mean , my children looks , and therein fasting , hast thou made me gaunt gaunt am i for the grave , gaunt as a grave , whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones .
can sick men play so nicely with their names ?
no , misery makes sport to mock itself since thou dost seek to kill my name in me , i mock my name , great king , to flatter thee .
should dying men flatter with those that live ?
no , no , men living flatter those that die .
thou , now , thou flatterest me .
o , no !
thou diest , though i the sicker be .
i am in health , i breathe , and see thee now he that made me knows i see thee ill , ill in myself to see , and in thee seeing thy is no lesser than thy land wherein thou liest in reputation sick , and thou , too careless patient as thou art , thy anointed body to the cure of those physicians that first wounded thee a thousand flatterers sit within thy crown , whose compass is no bigger than thy head , and yet , incaged in so small a verge , the waste is no whit lesser than thy land .
o , had thy grandsire with a prophet eye seen how his son son should destroy his sons , from forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame , deposing thee before thou wert possess , which art possess now to depose thyself .
why , cousin , wert thou regent of the world , it were a shame to let this land by lease , but for thy world enjoying but this land , is it not more than shame to shame it so ?
landlord of england art thou now , not king thy state of law is bondslave to the law , and thou a lunatic fool , presuming on an ague privilege , darest with thy frozen admonition make pale our cheek , chasing the royal blood with fury from his native residence .
now , by my seat right royal majesty , wert thou not brother to great edward son , this tongue that runs so roundly in thy head should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders .
o , spare me not , my brother edward son , for that i was his father edward son , that blood already , like the pelican , hast thou tapp out and drunkenly caroused my brother gloucester , plain soul , whom fair befal in heaven happy souls !
may be a precedent and witness good that thou not spilling edward blood join with the present sickness that i have , and thy unkindness be like crooked age , to crop at once a too long wither flower .
live in thy shame , but die not shame with thee !
these words hereafter thy tormentors be !
convey me to my bed , then to my grave love they to live that love and honour have .
exit , borne off by his attendants and let them die that age and sullens have , for both hast thou , and both become the grave .
i do beseech your majesty , impute his words to wayward sickliness and age in him he loves you , on my life , and holds you dear as harry duke of hereford , were he here .
right , you say true as hereford love , so his , as theirs , so mine , and all be as it is .
enter northumberland my liege , old gaunt commends him to your majesty .
what says he ?
nay , nothing , all is said his tongue is now a stringless instrument , words , life and all , old lancaster hath spent .
be york the next that must be bankrupt so !
though death be poor , it ends a mortal woe .
the ripest fruit first falls , and so doth he , his time is spent , our pilgrimage must be .
so much for that .
now for our irish wars we must supplant those rough kerns , which live like venom where no venom else but only they have privilege to live .
and for these great affairs do ask some charge , towards our assistance we do seize to us the plate , corn , revenues and moveables , whereof our uncle gaunt did stand possess .
how long shall i be patient ?
ah , how long shall tender duty make me suffer wrong ?
not gloucester death , nor hereford banishment not gaunt rebukes , nor england private wrongs , nor the prevention of poor bolingbroke about his marriage , nor my own disgrace , have ever made me sour my patient cheek , or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign face .
i am the last of noble edward sons , of whom thy father , prince of wales , was first in war was never lion raged more fierce , in peace was never gentle lamb more mild , than was that young and princely gentleman .
his face thou hast , for even so look he , accomplish with the number of thy hours , but when he frown , it was against the french and not against his friends , his noble hand did will what he did spend and spent not that which his triumphant father hand had won , his hands were guilty of no kindred blood , but bloody with the enemies of his kin .
o richard !
york is too far gone with grief , or else he never would compare between .
why , uncle , what the matter ?
o my liege , pardon me , if you please , if n ot , i , pleased not to be pardon , am content withal .
seek you to seize and gripe into your hands the royalties and rights of banish hereford ?
is not gaunt dead , and doth not hereford live ?
was not gaunt just , and is not harry true ?
did not the one deserve to have an heir ?
is not his heir a son ?
take hereford rights away , and take from time his charters and his customary rights , let not then ensue , be not thyself , for how art thou a king but by fair sequence and succession ?
now , afore god god forbid i say true ! if you do wrongfully seize hereford rights , call in the letters patent that he hath by his to sue his livery , and deny his offer homage , you pluck a thousand dangers on your head , you lose a thousand hearts and prick my tender patience , to those thoughts which honour and allegiance can not think .
think what you will , we seize into our hands his plate , his goods , his money and his lands .
i not be by the while my liege , farewell what will ensue hereof , there none can tell , but by bad courses may be understood that their events can never fall out good .
exit go , bushy , to the earl of wiltshire straight bid him repair to us to ely house to see this business .
next we will for ireland , and is time , i trow and we create , in absence of ourself , our uncle york lord governor of england , for he is just and always loved us well .
come on , our queen must we part , be merry , for our time of stay is short flourish .
exeunt king richard ii , queen , duke of aumerle , bushy , green , and bagot well , lords , the duke of lancaster is dead .
and living too , for now his son is duke .
barely in title , not in revenue .
richly in both , if justice had her right .
my heart is great , but it must break with silence , be disburden with a liberal tongue .
nay , speak thy mind , and let him speak more that speaks thy words again to do thee harm !
tends that thou wouldst speak to the duke of hereford ?
if it be so , out with it boldly , man , quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him .
no good at all that i can do for him , unless you call it good to pity him , bereft and gelded of his patrimony .
now , afore god , is shame such wrongs are borne in him , a royal prince , and many moe of noble blood in this declining land .
the king is not himself , but basely led by flatterers , and what they will inform , merely in hate , any of us all , that will the king severely prosecute us , our lives , our children , and our heirs .
the commons hath he pill with grievous taxes , and quite lost their hearts the nobles hath he fined for ancient quarrels , and quite lost their hearts .
and daily new exactions are devised , as blanks , benevolences , and i wot not what but what , o ' god name , doth become of this ?
wars have not wasted it , for warr he hath not , but basely yielded upon compromise that which his noble ancestors achieved with blows more hath he spent in peace than they in wars .
the earl of wiltshire hath the realm in farm .
the king grown bankrupt , like a broken man .
reproach and dissolution hangeth over him .
he hath not money for these irish wars , his burthenous taxations notwithstanding , but by the robbing of the banish duke .
his noble kinsman most degenerate king !
but , lords , we hear this fearful tempest sing , yet see no shelter to avoid the storm , we see the wind sit sore upon our sails , and yet we strike not , but securely perish .
we see the very wreck that we must suffer , and unavoided is the danger now , for suffering so the causes of our wreck .
not so , even through the hollow eyes of death i spy life peering , but i dare not say how near the tidings of our comfort is .
nay , let us share thy thoughts , as thou dost ours .
be confident to speak , northumberland we three are but thyself , and , speaking so , thy words are but as thoughts , therefore , be bold .
then thus i have from port le blanc , a bay in brittany , received intelligence that harry duke of hereford , rainold lord cobham , that late broke from the duke of exeter , his brother , archbishop late of canterbury , sir thomas erpingham , sir john ramston , sir john norbery , sir robert waterton and francis quoint , all these well furnish by the duke of bretagne with eight tall ships , three thousand men of war , are making hither with all due expedience and shortly mean to touch our northern shore perhaps they had ere this , but that they stay the first departing of the king for ireland .
if then we shall shake off our slavish yoke , imp out our drooping country broken wing , redeem from broking pawn the blemish crown , wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre gilt and make high majesty look like itself , away with me in post to ravenspurgh , but if you faint , as fearing to do so , stay and be secret , and myself will go .
to horse , to horse !
urge doubts to them that fear .
hold out my horse , and i will first be there .
exeunt scene ii .
the palace .
enter queen , bushy , and bagot madam , your majesty is too much sad you promised , when you parted with the king , to lay aside heaviness and entertain a cheerful disposition .
to please the king i did , to please myself i can not do it , yet i know no cause why i should welcome such a guest as grief , save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest as my sweet richard yet again , methinks , some unborn sorrow , ripe in fortune womb , is coming towards me , and my inward soul with nothing trembles at some thing it grieves , more than with parting from my lord the king .
each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows , which shows like grief itself , but is not so , for sorrow eye , glazed with blinding tears , divides one thing entire to many objects , like perspectives , which rightly gazed upon show nothing but confusion , eyed awry distinguish form so your sweet majesty , looking awry upon your lord departure , find shapes of grief , more than himself , to wail , which , look on as it is , is nought but shadows of what it is not .
then , queen , more than your lord departure weep not more not seen , or if it be , is with false sorrow eye , which for things true weeps things imaginary .
it may be so , but yet my inward soul persuades me it is otherwise it be , i can not but be sad , so heavy sad as , though on thinking on no thought i think , makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink .
is nothing but conceit , my gracious lady .
is nothing less conceit is still derived from some forefather grief , mine is not so , for nothing had begot my something grief , or something hath the nothing that i grieve is in reversion that i do possess , but what it is , that is not yet known , what i can not name , is nameless woe , i wot .
enter green god save your majesty !
and well met , gentlemen i hope the king is not yet shipp for ireland .
why hopest thou so ?
is better hope he is , for his designs crave haste , his haste good hope then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp ?
that he , our hope , might have retired his power , and driven into despair an enemy hope , who strongly hath set footing in this land the banish bolingbroke repeals himself , and with uplifted arms is safe arrived at ravenspurgh .
now god in heaven forbid !
ah , madam , is too true and that is worse , the lord northumberland , his son young henry percy , the lords of ross , beaumond , and willoughby , with all their powerful friends , are fled to him .
why have you not proclaim northumberland and all the rest revolted faction traitors ?
we have whereupon the earl of worcester hath broke his staff , resign his stewardship , and all the household servants fled with him to bolingbroke .
so , green , thou art the midwife to my woe , and bolingbroke my sorrow dismal heir now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy , and i , a gasping mother , have woe to woe , sorrow to sorrow join .
despair not , madam .
who shall hinder me ?
i will despair , and be at enmity with cozening hope he is a flatterer , a parasite , a keeper back of death , who gently would dissolve the bands of life , which false hope lingers in extremity .
enter duke of york here comes the duke of york .
with signs of war about his aged neck o , full of careful business are his looks !
uncle , for god sake , speak comfortable words .
should i do so , i should belie my thoughts comfort in heaven , and we are on the earth , where nothing lives but crosses , cares and grief .
your husband , he is gone to save far off , whilst others come to make him lose at home here am i left to underprop his land , who , weak with age , can not support myself now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made , now shall he try his friends that flatter him .
enter a servant my lord , your son was gone before i came .
he was ?
why , so !
go all which way it will !
the nobles they are fled , the commons they are cold , and will , i fear , revolt on hereford side .
sirrah , get thee to plashy , to my sister gloucester , bid her send me presently a thousand pound hold , take my ring .
my lord , i had forgot to tell your lordship , , as i came by , i called there , but i shall grieve you to report the rest .
what , knave ?
an hour before i came , the duchess died .
god for his mercy !
what a tide of woes comes rushing on this woeful land at once !
i know not what to do i would to god , so my untruth had not provoked him to it , the king had cut off my head with my brother .
what , are there no posts dispatch for ireland ?
how shall we do for money for these wars ?
come , sister , cousin , i would say pray , pardon me .
go , fellow , get thee home , provide some carts and bring away the armour that is there .
exit servant gentlemen , will you go muster men ?
if i know how or which way to order these affairs thus thrust disorderly into my hands , never believe me .
both are my kinsmen the one is my sovereign , whom both my oath and duty bids defend , the other again is my kinsman , whom the king hath wrong , whom conscience and my kindred bids to right .
well , somewhat we must do .
come , cousin , i dispose of you .
gentlemen , go , muster up your men , and meet me presently at berkeley .
i should to plashy too , but time will not permit all is uneven , and every thing is left at six and seven .
exeunt duke of york and queen the wind sits fair for news to go to ireland , but none returns .
for us to levy power proportionable to the enemy is all unpossible .
besides , our nearness to the king in love is near the hate of those love not the king .
and that the wavering commons for their love lies in their purses , and whoso empties them by so much fills their hearts with deadly hate .
wherein the king stands generally condemn .
if judgement lie in them , then so do we , because we ever have been near the king .
well , i will for refuge straight to bristol castle the earl of wiltshire is already there .
thither will i with you , for little office the hateful commons will perform for us , except like curs to tear us all to pieces .
will you go along with us ?
no , i will to ireland to his majesty .
farewell if heart presages be not vain , we three here art that shall meet again .
that as york thrives to beat back bolingbroke .
alas , poor duke !
the task he undertakes is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry where one on his side fights , thousands will fly .
farewell at once , for once , for all , and ever .
well , we may meet again .
i fear me , never .
exeunt scene iii .
wilds in gloucestershire .
enter henry bolingbroke and northumberland , with forces how far is it , my lord , to berkeley now ?
believe me , noble lord , i am a stranger here in gloucestershire these high wild hills and rough uneven ways draws out our miles , and makes them wearisome , and yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar , making the hard way sweet and delectable .
but i bethink me what a weary way from ravenspurgh to cotswold will be found in ross and willoughby , wanting your company , which , i protest , hath very much beguiled the tediousness and process of my travel but theirs is sweetened with the hope to have the present benefit which i possess , and hope to joy is little less in joy than hope enjoy by this the weary lords shall make their way seem short , as mine hath done by sight of what i have , your noble company .
of much less value is my company than your good words .
but who comes here ?
enter henry percy it is my son , young harry percy , sent from my brother worcester , whencesoever .
harry , how fares your uncle ?
i had thought , my lord , to have learn his health of you .
why , is he not with the queen ?
no , my good lord , he hath forsook the court , broken his staff of office and dispersed the household of the king .
what was his reason ?
he was not so resolved when last we spake together .
because your lordship was proclaimed traitor .
but he , my lord , is gone to ravenspurgh , to offer service to the duke of hereford , and sent me over by berkeley , to discover what power the duke of york had levied there , then with directions to repair to ravenspurgh .
have you forgot the duke of hereford , boy ?
no , my good lord , for that is not forgot which i did remember to my knowledge , i never in my life did look on him .
then learn to know him now , this is the duke .
my gracious lord , i tender you my service , such as it is , being tender , raw and young which elder days shall ripen and confirm to more approved service and desert .
i thank thee , gentle percy , and be sure i count myself in nothing else so happy as in a soul remembering my good friends , and , as my fortune ripens with thy love , it shall be still thy true love recompense my heart this covenant makes , my hand thus seals it .
how far is it to berkeley ?
and what stir keeps good old york there with his men of war ?
there stands the castle , by yon tuft of trees , mann with three hundred men , as i have heard , and in it are the lords of york , berkeley , and seymour , none else of name and noble estimate .
enter lord ross and lord willoughby here come the lords of ross and willoughby , bloody with spurring , with haste .
welcome , my lords .
i wot your love pursues a banish traitor all my treasury is yet but unfelt thanks , which more enrich shall be your love and labour recompense .
your presence makes us rich , most noble lord .
and far surmounts our labour to attain it .
evermore thanks , the exchequer of the poor , which , till my infant fortune comes to years , stands for my bounty .
but who comes here ?
enter lord berkeley it is my lord of berkeley , as i guess .
my lord of hereford , my message is to you .
my lord , my answer is to lancaster , and i am come to seek that name in england , and i must find that title in your tongue , before i make reply to aught you say .
mistake me not , my lord , is not my meaning to raze one title of your honour out to you , my lord , i come , what lord you will , from the most gracious regent of this land , the duke of york , to know what pricks you on to take advantage of the absent time and fright our native peace with arms .
enter duke of york attended i shall not need transport my words by you , here comes his grace in person .
my noble uncle !
kneels show me thy humble heart , and not thy knee , whose duty is deceiveable and false .
my gracious uncle tut , tut !
grace me no grace , nor uncle me no uncle i am no traitor uncle , and that word . '
in an ungracious mouth is but profane .
why have those banish and forbidden legs dared once to touch a dust of england ground ?
but then more ? '
why have they dared to march so many miles upon her peaceful bosom , frighting her villages with war and ostentation of despised arms ?
comest thou because the anointed king is hence ?
why , foolish boy , the king is left behind , and in my loyal bosom lies his power .
were i but now the lord of such hot youth as when brave gaunt , thy father , and myself rescued the black prince , that young mars of men , from forth the ranks of many thousand french , o , then how quickly should this arm of mine .
now prisoner to the palsy , chastise thee and minister correction to thy fault !
my gracious uncle , let me know my fault on what condition stands it and wherein ?
even in condition of the worst degree , in gross rebellion and detested treason thou art a banish man , and here art come before the expiration of thy time , in braving arms against thy sovereign .
as i was banish , i was banish hereford , but as i come , i come for lancaster .
and , noble uncle , i beseech your grace look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye you are my father , for methinks in you i see old gaunt alive , o , then , my father , will you permit that i shall stand condemn a wandering vagabond , my rights and royalties pluck from my arms perforce and given away to upstart unthrifts ?
wherefore was i born ?
if that my cousin king be king of england , it must be granted i am duke of lancaster .
you have a son , aumerle , my noble cousin , had you first died , and he been thus trod down , he should have found his uncle gaunt a father , to rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay .
i am denied to sue my livery here , and yet my give me leave my father goods are all distrain and sold , and these and all are all amiss employ .
what would you have me do ?
i am a subject , and i challenge law attorneys are denied me , and therefore , personally i lay my claim to my inheritance of free descent .
the noble duke hath been too much abused .
it stands your grace upon to do him right .
base men by his endowments are made great .
my lords of england , let me tell you this i have had feeling of my cousin wrongs and laboured all i could to do him right , but in this kind to come , in braving arms , be his own carver and cut out his way , to find out right with wrong , it may not be , and you that do abet him in this kind cherish rebellion and are rebels all .
the noble duke hath sworn his coming is but for his own , and for the right of that we all have strongly sworn to give him aid , and let him see joy that breaks that oath !
well , well , i see the issue of these arms i can not mend it , i must needs confess , because my power is weak and all ill left but if i could , by him that gave me life , i would attach you all and make you stoop unto the sovereign mercy of the king , but since i can not , be it known to you i do remain as neuter .
so , fare you well , unless you please to enter in the castle and there repose you for this night .
an offer , uncle , that we will accept but we must win your grace to go with us to bristol castle , which they say is held by bushy , bagot and their complices , the caterpillars of the commonwealth , which i have sworn to weed and pluck away .
it may be i will go with you but yet i pause , for i am loath to break our country laws .
nor friends nor foes , to me welcome you are things past redress are now with me past care .
exeunt scene iv .
a camp in wales .
enter earl of salisbury and a welsh captain my lord of salisbury , we have stay ten days , and hardly kept our countrymen together , and yet we hear no tidings from the king , therefore we will disperse ourselves farewell .
stay yet another day , thou trusty welshman the king reposeth all his confidence in thee .
is thought the king is dead , we will not stay .
the in our country are all wither and meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven , the moon looks bloody on the earth and prophets whisper fearful change , rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap , the one in fear to lose what they enjoy , the other to enjoy by rage and war these signs forerun the death or fall of kings .
farewell our countrymen are gone and fled , as well assured richard their king is dead .
exit ah , richard , with the eyes of heavy mind i see thy glory like a shooting star fall to the base earth from the firmament .
thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west , witnessing storms to come , woe and unrest thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes , and crossly to thy good all fortune goes .
exit act iii scene bristol .
before the castle .
enter henry bolingbroke , duke of york , northumberland , lord ross , henry percy , lord willoughby , with bushy and green , prisoners bring forth these men .
bushy and green , i will not vex your souls since presently your souls must part your bodies with too much urging your pernicious lives , for no charity , yet , to wash your blood from off my hands , here in the view of men i will unfold some causes of your deaths .
you have misled a prince , a royal king , a happy gentleman in blood and lineaments , by you unhappied and disfigured clean you have in manner with your sinful hours made a divorce betwixt his queen and him , broke the possession of a royal bed and stain the beauty of a fair queen cheeks with tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs .
myself , a prince by fortune of my birth , near to the king in blood , and near in love till you did make him misinterpret me , have stoop my neck under your injuries , and sigh my english breath in foreign clouds , eating the bitter bread of banishment , whilst you have fed upon my signories , dispark my parks and fell my forest woods , from my own windows torn my household coat , razed out my imprese , leaving me no sign , save men opinions and my living blood , to show the world i am a gentleman .
this and much more , much more than twice all this , condemns you to the death .
see them deliver over to execution and the hand of death .
more welcome is the stroke of death to me than bolingbroke to england .
lords , farewell .
my comfort is that heaven will take our souls and plague injustice with the pains of hell .
my lord northumberland , see them dispatch .
exeunt northumberland and others , with the prisoners uncle , you say the queen is at your house , for god sake , fairly let her be entreated tell her i send to her my kind commends , take special care my greetings be deliver .
a gentleman of mine i have dispatch with letters of your love to her at large .
thank , gentle uncle .
come , lords , away .
to fight with glendower and his complices awhile to work , and after holiday .
exeunt scene ii .
the coast of wales .
a castle in view .
drums , flourish and colours .
enter king richard ii , the bishop of carlisle , duke of aumerle , and soldiers barkloughly castle call they this at hand ?
yea , my lord .
how brooks your grace the air , after your late tossing on the breaking seas ?
needs must i like it well i weep for joy to stand upon my kingdom once again .
dear earth , i do salute thee with my hand , though rebels wound thee with their horses ' hoofs as a mother with her child plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting , so , weeping , smiling , greet i thee , my earth , and do thee favours with my royal hands .
feed not thy sovereign foe , my gentle earth , nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense , but let thy spiders , that suck up thy venom , and toads lie in their way , doing annoyance to the treacherous feet which with usurping steps do trample thee yield stinging nettles to mine enemies , and when they from thy bosom pluck a flower , guard it , i pray thee , with a lurking adder whose double tongue may with a mortal touch throw death upon thy sovereign enemies .
mock not my senseless conjuration , lords this earth shall have a feeling and these stones prove armed soldiers , ere her native king shall falter under foul rebellion arms .
fear not , my lord that power that made you king hath power to keep you king in spite of all .
the means that heaven yields must be embraced , and not neglected , else , if heaven would , and we will not , heaven offer we refuse , the proffer means of succor and redress .
he means , my lord , that we are too remiss , whilst bolingbroke , through our security , grows strong and great in substance and in power .
discomfortable cousin !
thou not that when the searching eye of heaven is hid , behind the globe , that lights the lower world , then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen in murders and in outrage , boldly here , but when from under this terrestrial ball he fires the proud tops of the eastern pines and darts his light through every guilty hole , then murders , treasons and detested sins , the cloak of night being pluck from off their backs , stand bare and naked , trembling at themselves ?
so when this thief , this traitor , bolingbroke , who all this while hath revell in the night whilst we were wandering with the antipodes , shall see us rising in our throne , the east , his treasons will sit blushing in his face , not able to endure the sight of day , but tremble at his sin .
not all the water in the rough rude sea can wash the balm off from an anointed king , the breath of worldly men can not depose the deputy elected by the lord for every man that bolingbroke hath press to lift shrewd steel against our golden crown , god for his richard hath in heavenly pay a glorious angel then , if angels fight , weak men must fall , for heaven still guards the right .
enter earl of salisbury welcome , my lord how far off lies your power ?
nor near nor farther off , my gracious lord , than this weak arm discomfort guides my tongue and bids me speak of nothing but despair .
one day too late , i fear me , noble lord , hath clouded all thy happy days on earth o , call back yesterday , bid time return , and thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men !
, , unhappy day , too late , thy joys , friends , fortune and thy state for all the welshmen , hearing thou wert dead .
are gone to bolingbroke , dispersed and fled .
comfort , my liege , why looks your grace so pale ?
but now the blood of twenty thousand men did triumph in my face , and they are fled , and , till so much blood thither come again , have i not reason to look pale and dead ?
all souls that will be safe fly from my side , for time hath set a blot upon my pride .
comfort , my liege , remember who you are .
i had forgot myself , am i not king ?
awake , thou coward majesty !
thou sleepest .
is not the king name twenty thousand names ?
arm , arm , my name !
a puny subject strikes at thy great glory .
look not to the ground , ye favourites of a king are we not high ?
high be our thoughts i know my uncle york hath power enough to serve our turn .
but who comes here ?
enter sir stephen scroop more health and happiness betide my liege than can my tongue deliver him !
mine ear is open and my heart prepared , the worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold .
say , is my kingdom lost ?
why , was my care and what loss is it to be rid of care ?
strives bolingbroke to be as great as we ?
greater he shall not be , if he serve god , we serve him too and be his fellow so revolt our subjects ?
that we can not mend , they break their faith to god as well as us cry woe , destruction , ruin and decay the worst is death , and death will have his day .
glad am i that your highness is so arm to bear the tidings of calamity .
like an unseasonable stormy day , which makes the silver rivers drown their shores , as if the world were all dissolved to tears , so high above his limits swells the rage of bolingbroke , covering your fearful land with hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel .
have arm their thin and hairless scalps against thy majesty , boys , with women voices , strive to speak big and clap their female joints in stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown the very beadsmen learn to bend their bows of yew against thy state , yea , manage rusty bills against thy seat both young and old rebel , and all goes worse than i have power to tell .
too well , too well thou a tale so where is the earl of wiltshire ?
where is bagot ?
what is become of bushy ?
where is green ?
that they have let the dangerous enemy measure our confines with such peaceful steps ?
if we prevail , their heads shall pay for it i warrant they have made peace with bolingbroke .
peace have they made with him indeed , my lord .
o villains , vipers , damn without redemption !
dogs , easily won to fawn on any man !
snakes , in my warm , that sting my heart !
three judases , each one thrice worse than judas !
would they make peace ?
terrible hell make war upon their spotted souls for this offence !
sweet love , i see , changing his property , turns to the sourest and most deadly hate again uncurse their souls , their peace is made with heads , and not with hands , those whom you curse have felt the worst of death destroying wound and lie full low , graved in the hollow ground .
is bushy , green , and the earl of wiltshire dead ?
ay , all of them at bristol lost their heads .
where is the duke my father with his power ?
no matter where , of comfort no man speak let talk of graves , of worms , and epitaphs , make dust our paper and with rainy eyes write sorrow on the bosom of the earth , let choose executors and talk of wills and yet not so , for what can we bequeath save our deposed bodies to the ground ?
our lands , our lives and all are bolingbroke , and nothing can we call our own but death and that small model of the barren earth which serves as paste and cover to our bones .
for god sake , let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings , how some have been deposed , some slain in war , some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed , some poison by their wives some sleeping kill , all murder for within the hollow crown that rounds the mortal temples of a king keeps death his court and there the antic sits , scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp , allowing him a breath , a little scene , to monarchize , be fear and kill with looks , infusing him with self and vain conceit , as if this flesh which walls about our life , were brass impregnable , and humour thus comes at the last and with a little pin bores through his castle wall , and farewell king !
cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood with solemn reverence throw away respect , tradition , form and ceremonious duty , for you have but mistook me all this while i live with bread like you , feel want , taste grief , need friends subjected thus , how can you say to me , i am a king ?
my lord , wise men sit and wail their woes , but presently prevent the ways to wail .
to fear the foe , since fear oppresseth strength , gives in your weakness strength unto your foe , and so your follies fight against yourself .
fear and be slain , no worse can come to fight and fight and die is death destroying death , where fearing dying pays death servile breath .
my father hath a power , inquire of him and learn to make a body of a limb .
thou chidest me well proud bolingbroke , i come to change blows with thee for our day of doom .
this ague fit of fear is , an easy task it is to win our own .
say , scroop , where lies our uncle with his power ?
speak sweetly , man , although thy looks be sour .
men judge by the complexion of the sky the state and inclination of the day so may you by my dull and heavy eye , my tongue hath but a heavier tale to say .
i play the torturer , by small and small to lengthen out the worst that must be spoken your uncle york is join with bolingbroke , and all your northern castles yielded up , and all your southern gentlemen in arms upon his party .
thou hast said enough .
beshrew thee , cousin , which didst lead me forth to duke of aumerle of that sweet way i was in to despair !
what say you now ?
what comfort have we now ?
by heaven , i hate him everlastingly that bids me be of comfort any more .
go to flint castle there i pine away , a king , woe slave , shall kingly woe obey .
that power i have , discharge , and let them go to ear the land that hath some hope to grow , for i have none let no man speak again to alter this , for counsel is but vain .
my liege , one word .
he does me double wrong that wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue .
discharge my followers let them hence away , from richard night to bolingbroke fair day .
exeunt scene iii .
wales .
before flint castle .
enter , with drum and colours , henry bolingbroke , duke of york , northumberland , attendants , and forces so that by this intelligence we learn the welshmen are dispersed , and salisbury is gone to meet the king , who lately landed with some few private friends upon this coast .
the news is very fair and good , my lord richard not far from hence hath hid his head .
it would beseem the lord northumberland to say richard ' alack the heavy day when such a sacred king should hide his head .
your grace mistakes , only to be brief left i his title out .
the time hath been , would you have been so brief with him , he would have been so brief with you , to shorten you , for taking so the head , your whole head length .
mistake not , uncle , further than you should .
take not , good cousin , further than you should .
lest you mistake the heavens are our heads .
i know it , uncle , and oppose not myself against their will .
but who comes here ?
enter henry percy welcome , harry what , will not this castle yield ?
the castle royally is mann , my lord , against thy entrance .
royally !
why , it contains no king ?
yes , my good lord , it doth contain a king , king richard lies within the limits of yon lime and stone and with him are the lord aumerle , lord salisbury , sir stephen scroop , besides a clergyman of holy reverence , who , i can not learn .
o , belike it is the bishop of carlisle .
noble lords , go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle , through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley into his ruin ears , and thus deliver henry bolingbroke on both his knees doth kiss king richard hand and sends allegiance and true faith of heart to his most royal person , hither come even at his feet to lay my arms and power , provided that my banishment repeal and lands restored again be freely granted if not , i use the advantage of my power and lay the summer dust with showers of blood rain from the wounds of slaughter englishmen the which , how far off from the mind of bolingbroke it is , such crimson tempest should bedrench the fresh green lap of fair king richard land , my stooping duty tenderly shall show .
go , signify as much , while here we march upon the grassy carpet of this plain .
let march without the noise of threatening drum , that from this castle tatter battlements our fair appointments may be well perused .
methinks king richard and myself should meet with no less terror than the elements of fire and water , when their thundering shock at meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven .
be he the fire , i be the yielding water the rage be his , whilst on the earth i rain my waters , on the earth , and not on him .
march on , and mark king richard how he looks .
parle without , and answer within .
then a flourish .
enter on the walls , king richard ii , the bishop of carlisle , duke of aumerle , sir stephen scroop , and earl of salisbury see , see , king richard doth himself appear , as doth the blushing discontented sun from out the fiery portal of the east , when he perceives the envious clouds are bent to dim his glory and to stain the track of his bright passage to the occident .
yet looks he like a king behold , his eye , as bright as is the eagle , lightens forth controlling majesty alack , alack , for woe , that any harm should stain so fair a show !
we are amazed , and thus long have we stood to watch the fearful bending of thy knee , to northumberland because we thought ourself thy lawful king and if we be , how dare thy joints forget to pay their awful duty to our presence ?
if we be not , show us the hand of god that hath dismissed us from our stewardship , for well we know , no hand of blood and bone can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre , unless he do profane , steal , or usurp .
and though you think that all , as you have done , have torn their souls by turning them from us , and we are barren and bereft of friends , yet know , my master , god omnipotent , is mustering in his clouds on our behalf armies of pestilence , and they shall strike your children yet unborn and unbegot , that lift your vassal hands against my head and threat the glory of my precious crown .
tell bolingbroke for yond methinks he stands that every stride he makes upon my land is dangerous treason he is come to open the purple testament of bleeding war , but ere the crown he looks for live in peace , ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers ' sons shall ill become the flower of england face , change the complexion of her peace to scarlet indignation and bedew her pastures ' grass with faithful english blood .
the king of heaven forbid our lord the king should so with civil and uncivil arms be rush upon !
thy thrice noble cousin harry bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand , and by the honourable tomb he swears , that stands upon your royal grandsire bones , and by the royalties of both your bloods , currents that spring from one most gracious head , and by the buried hand of warlike gaunt , and by the worth and honour of himself , comprising all that may be sworn or said , his coming hither hath no further scope than for his lineal royalties and to beg enfranchisement immediate on his kn ees which on thy royal party granted once , his glittering arms he will commend to rust , his barbed steeds to stables , and his heart to faithful service of your majesty .
this swears he , as he is a prince , is just , and , as i am a gentleman , i credit him .
northumberland , say thus the king returns his noble cousin is right welcome hither , and all the number of his fair demands shall be accomplish without contradiction with all the gracious utterance thou hast speak to his gentle hearing kind commends .
we do debase ourselves , cousin , do we not , to duke of aumerle to look so poorly and to speak so fair ?
shall we call back northumberland , and send defiance to the traitor , and so die ?
no , good my lord , let fight with gentle words till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords .
o god , o god !
that this tongue of mine , that laid the sentence of dread banishment on yon proud man , should take it off again with words of sooth !
o that i were as great as is my grief , or lesser than my name !
or that i could forget what i have been , or not remember what i must be now !
thou , proud heart ?
i give thee scope to beat , since foes have scope to beat both thee and me .
northumberland comes back from bolingbroke .
what must the king do now ?
must he submit ?
the king shall do it must he be deposed ?
the king shall be contented must he lose the name of king ?
o ' god name , let it go i give my jewels for a set of beads , my gorgeous palace for a hermitage , my gay apparel for an almsman gown , my figured goblets for a dish of wood , my sceptre for a palmer walking staff , my subjects for a pair of carved saints and my large kingdom for a little grave , a little little grave , an obscure grave , or i be buried in the king highway , some way of common trade , where subjects ' feet may hourly trample on their sovereign head , for on my heart they tread now whilst i live , and buried once , why not upon my head ?
aumerle , thou , my cousin !
we make foul weather with despised tears , our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn , and make a dearth in this revolting land .
or shall we play the wantons with our woes , and make some pretty match with shedding tears ?
as thus , to drop them still upon one place , till they have fretted us a pair of graves within the earth , and , therein laid , there lies two kinsmen digg their graves with weeping eyes .
would not this ill do well ?
well , well , i see i talk but idly , and you laugh at me .
most mighty prince , my lord northumberland , what says king bolingbroke ?
will his majesty give richard leave to live till richard die ?
you make a leg , and bolingbroke says ay .
my lord , in the base court he doth attend to speak with you , may it please you to come down .
down , down i come , like glistering phaethon , wanting the manage of unruly jades .
in the base court ?
base court , where kings grow base , to come at traitors ' calls and do them grace .
in the base court ?
come down ?
down , court !
down , king !
for shriek where mounting larks should sing .
exeunt from above what says his majesty ?
sorrow and grief of heart makes him speak fondly , like a frantic man yet he is come .
enter king richard and his attendants below stand all apart , and show fair duty to his majesty .
he kneels down my gracious lord , fair cousin , you debase your princely knee to make the base earth proud with kissing it me rather had my heart might feel your love than my unpleased eye see your courtesy .
up , cousin , up , your heart is up , i know , thus high at least , although your knee be low .
my gracious lord , i come but for mine own .
your own is yours , and i am yours , and all .
so far be mine , my most redoubted lord , as my true service shall deserve your love .
well you deserve they well deserve to have , that know the and surest way to get .
uncle , give me your hands nay , dry your eyes , tears show their love , but want their remedies .
cousin , i am too young to be your father , though you are old enough to be my heir .
what you will have , i give , and willing too , for do we must what force will have us do .
set on towards london , cousin , is it so ?
yea , my good lord .
then i must not say no .
flourish .
exeunt scene iv .
langley .
the duke of york garden .
enter the queen and two ladies what sport shall we devise here in this garden , to drive away the heavy thought of care ?
madam , we play at bowls .
make me think the world is full of rubs , and that my fortune rubs against the bias .
madam , we dance .
my legs can keep no measure in delight , when my poor heart no measure keeps in grief therefore , no dancing , girl , some other sport .
madam , we tell tales .
of sorrow or of joy ?
of either , madam .
of neither , girl for of joy , being altogether wanting , it doth remember me the more of sorrow , or if of grief , being altogether had , it adds more sorrow to my want of joy for what i have i need not to repeat , and what i want it boots not to complain .
madam , i sing .
is well that thou hast cause but thou shouldst please me better , wouldst thou weep .
i could weep , madam , would it do you good .
and i could sing , would weeping do me good , and never borrow any tear of thee .
enter a gardener , and two servants but stay , here come the gardeners let step into the shadow of these trees .
my wretchedness unto a row of pins , they talk of state , for every one doth so against a change , woe is forerun with woe .
queen and ladies retire go , bind thou up yon dangling apricocks , which , like unruly children , make their sire stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight give some supportance to the bending twigs .
go thou , and like an executioner , cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays , that look too lofty in our commonwealth all must be even in our government .
you thus employ , i will go root away the noisome weeds , which without profit suck the soil fertility from wholesome flowers .
why should we in the compass of a pale keep law and form and due proportion , showing , as in a model , our firm estate , when our garden , the whole land , is full of weeds , her fairest flowers choked up , her all upturned , her hedges ruin , her knots disorder and her wholesome herbs swarming with caterpillars ?
hold thy peace he that hath suffer this disorder spring hath now himself met with the fall of leaf the weeds which his leaves did shelter , that seem in eating him to hold him up , are pluck up root and all by bolingbroke , i mean the earl of wiltshire , bushy , green .
what , are they dead ?
they are , and bolingbroke hath seized the wasteful king .
o , what pity is it that he had not so trimm and dress his land as we this garden !
we at time of year do wound the bark , the skin of our , lest , being in sap and blood , with too much riches it confound itself had he done so to great and growing men , they might have lived to bear and he to taste their fruits of duty superfluous branches we lop away , that bearing boughs may live had he done so , himself had borne the crown , which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down .
what , think you then the king shall be deposed ?
depress he is already , and deposed is doubt he will be letters came last night to a dear friend of the good duke of york , that tell black tidings .
o , i am press to death through want of speaking !
coming forward thou , old adam likeness , set to dress this garden , how dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news ?
what eve , what serpent , hath suggested thee to make a second fall of cursed man ?
why dost thou say king richard is deposed ?
darest thou , thou little better thing than earth , divine his downfall ?
say , where , when , and how , camest thou by this ill tidings ?
speak , thou wretch .
pardon me , madam little joy have i to breathe this news , yet what i say is true .
king richard , he is in the mighty hold of bolingbroke their fortunes both are weigh in your lord scale is nothing but himself , and some few vanities that make him light , but in the balance of great bolingbroke , besides himself , are all the english peers , and with that odds he weighs king richard down .
post you to london , and you will find it so , i speak no more than every one doth know .
nimble mischance , that art so light of foot , doth not thy embassage belong to me , and am i last that knows it ?
o , thou to serve me last , that i may longest keep thy sorrow in my breast .
come , ladies , go , to meet at london london king in woe .
what , was i born to this , that my sad look should grace the triumph of great bolingbroke ?
gardener , for telling me these news of woe , pray god the plants thou may never grow .
exeunt queen and ladies poor queen !
so that thy state might be no worse , i would my skill were subject to thy curse .
here did she fall a tear , here in this place i set a bank of rue , sour herb of grace rue , even for ruth , here shortly shall be seen , in the remembrance of a weeping queen .
exeunt act iv scene westminster hall .
enter , as to the parliament , henry bolingbroke , duke of aumerle , northumberland , henry percy , lord fitzwater , duke of surrey , the bishop of carlisle , the abbot of westminster , and another lord , herald , officers , and bagot call forth bagot .
now , bagot , freely speak thy mind , what thou dost know of noble gloucester death , who wrought it with the king , and who perform the bloody office of his timeless end .
then set before my face the lord aumerle .
cousin , stand forth , and look upon that man .
my lord aumerle , i know your daring tongue scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver .
in that dead time when gloucester death was plotted , i heard you say , not my arm of length , that reacheth from the restful english court as far as calais , to mine uncle head ? '
amongst much other talk , that very time , i heard you say that you had rather refuse the offer of an hundred thousand crowns than bolingbroke return to england , adding withal how blest this land would be in this your cousin death .
princes and noble lords , what answer shall i make to this base man ?
shall i so much dishonour my fair stars , on equal terms to give him chastisement ?
either i must , or have mine honour soil with the attainder of his slanderous lips .
there is my gage , the manual seal of death , that marks thee out for hell i say , thou liest , and will maintain what thou hast said is false in thy , though being all too base to stain the temper of my knightly sword .
bagot , forbear , thou shalt not take it up .
excepting one , i would he were the best in all this presence that hath moved me so .
if that thy valour stand on sympathy , there is my gage , aumerle , in gage to thine by that fair sun which shows me where thou , i heard thee say , and vauntingly thou spakest it that thou wert cause of noble gloucester death .
if thou it twenty times , thou liest , and i will turn thy falsehood to thy heart , where it was forged , with my rapier point .
thou darest not , coward , live to see that day .
now by my soul , i would it were this hour .
fitzwater , thou art damn to hell for this .
aumerle , thou liest , his honour is as true in this appeal as thou art all unjust , and that thou art so , there i throw my gage , to prove it on thee to the extremest point of mortal breathing seize it , if thou darest .
an if i do not , may my hands rot off and never brandish more revengeful steel over the glittering helmet of my foe !
i task the earth to the like , forsworn aumerle , and spur thee on with full as many lies as may be holloa in thy treacherous ear from sun to sun there is my honour pawn , engage it to the trial , if thou darest .
who sets me else ?
by heaven , i throw at all i have a thousand spirits in one breast , to answer twenty thousand such as you .
my lord fitzwater , i do remember well the very time aumerle and you did talk .
is very true you were in presence then , and you can witness with me this is true .
as false , by heaven , as heaven itself is true .
surrey , thou liest .
dishonourable boy !
that lie shall lie so heavy on my sword , that it shall render vengeance and revenge till thou the and that lie do lie in earth as quiet as thy father skull in proof whereof , there is my honour pawn , engage it to the trial , if thou darest .
how fondly dost thou spur a forward horse !
if i dare eat , or drink , or breathe , or live , i dare meet surrey in a wilderness , and spit upon him , whilst i say he lies , and lies , and lies there is my bond of faith , to tie thee to my strong correction .
as i intend to thrive in this new world , aumerle is guilty of my true appeal besides , i heard the banish norfolk say that thou , aumerle , didst send two of thy men to execute the noble duke at calais .
some honest christian trust me with a gage that norfolk lies here do i throw down this , if he may be repeal , to try his honour .
these differences shall all rest under gage till norfolk be repeal repeal he shall be , and , though mine enemy , restored again to all his lands and signories when he return , against aumerle we will enforce his trial .
that honourable day shall be seen .
many a time hath banish norfolk fought for jesu christ in glorious christian field , streaming the ensign of the christian cross against black pagans , turks , and saracens and toil with works of war , retired himself to italy , and there at venice gave his body to that pleasant country earth , and his pure soul unto his captain christ , under whose colours he had fought so long .
why , bishop , is norfolk dead ?
as surely as i live , my lord .
sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom of good old abraham !
lords appellants , your differences shall all rest under gage till we assign you to your days of trial .
enter duke of york , attended great duke of lancaster , i come to thee from richard , who with willing soul adopts thee heir , and his high sceptre yields to the possession of thy royal hand ascend his throne , descending now from him , and long live henry , fourth of that name !
in god name , i ascend the regal throne .
marry .
god forbid !
worst in this royal presence may i speak , yet best beseeming me to speak the truth .
would god that any in this noble presence were enough noble to be upright judge of noble richard !
then true noblesse would learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong .
what subject can give sentence on his king ?
and who sits here that is not richard subject ?
thieves are not judged but they are by to hear , although apparent guilt be seen in them , and shall the figure of god majesty , his captain , steward , , anointed , crowned , planted many years , be judged by subject and inferior breath , and he himself not present ?
o , forfend it , god , that in a christian climate souls refined should show so heinous , black , obscene a deed !
i speak to subjects , and a subject speaks , stirr up by god , thus boldly for his king my lord of hereford here , whom you call king , is a foul traitor to proud hereford king and if you crown him , let me prophesy the blood of english shall manure the ground , and future ages groan for this foul act , peace shall go sleep with turks and infidels , and in this seat of peace tumultuous wars shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound , disorder , horror , fear and mutiny shall here inhabit , and this land be call the field of golgotha and dead men skulls .
o , if you raise this house against this house , it will the woefullest division prove that ever fell upon this cursed earth .
prevent it , resist it , let it not be so , lest child , child children , cry against you woe !
well have you argued , sir , and , for your pains , of capital treason we arrest you here .
my lord of westminster , be it your charge to keep him safely till his day of trial .
may it please you , lords , to grant the commons ' suit .
fetch hither richard , that in common view he may surrender , so we shall proceed without suspicion .
i will be his conduct .
exit lords , you that here are under our arrest , procure your sureties for your days of answer .
little are we beholding to your love , and little look for at your helping hands .
duke of york , with king richard ii , and officers bearing the regalia alack , why am i sent for to a king , before i have shook off the regal thoughts wherewith i reign ?
i hardly yet have learn to insinuate , flatter , bow , and bend my limbs give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me to this submission .
yet i well remember the favours of these men were they not mine ?
did they not sometime cry , hail ! '
to me ?
so judas did to christ but he , in twelve , found truth in all but one i , in twelve thousand , none .
god save the king !
will no man say amen ?
am i both priest and clerk ?
well then , amen .
god save the king !
although i be not he , and yet , amen , if heaven do think him me .
to do what service am i sent for hither ?
to do that office of thine own good will which tired majesty did make thee offer , the resignation of thy state and crown to henry bolingbroke .
give me the crown .
here , cousin , seize the crown , here cousin on this side my hand , and on that side yours .
now is this golden crown like a deep well that owes two buckets , filling one another , the emptier ever dancing in the air , the other down , unseen and full of water that bucket down and full of tears am i , drinking my griefs , whilst you mount up on high .
i thought you had been willing to resign .
my crown i am , but still my griefs are mine you may my glories and my state depose , but not my griefs , still am i king of those .
part of your cares you give me with your crown .
your cares set up do not pluck my cares down .
my care is loss of care , by old care done , your care is gain of care , by new care won the cares i give i have , though given away , they tend the crown , yet still with me they stay .
are you contented to resign the crown ?
ay , no , no , ay , for i must nothing be , therefore no no , for i resign to thee .
now mark me , how i will undo myself , i give this heavy weight from off my head and this unwieldy sceptre from my hand , the pride of kingly sway from out my heart , with mine own tears i wash away my balm , with mine own hands i give away my crown , with mine own tongue deny my sacred state , with mine own breath release all duty rites all pomp and majesty i do forswear , my manors , rents , revenues i forego , my acts , decrees , and statutes i deny god pardon all oaths that are broke to me !
god keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee !
make me , that nothing have , with nothing grieved , and thou with all pleased , that hast all achieved !
long mayst thou live in richard seat to sit , and soon lie richard in an earthly pit !
god save king harry , unking richard says , and send him many years of sunshine days !
what more remains ?
no more , but that you read these accusations and these grievous crimes committed by your person and your followers against the state and profit of this land , that , by confessing them , the souls of men may deem that you are worthily deposed .
must i do so ?
and must i ravel out my folly ?
gentle northumberland , if thy offences were upon record , would it not shame thee in so fair a troop to read a lecture of them ?
if thou wouldst , there shouldst thou find one heinous article , containing the deposing of a king and cracking the strong warrant of an oath , mark with a blot , damn in the book of heaven nay , all of you that stand and look upon , whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself , though some of you with pilate wash your hands showing an outward pity , yet you pilates have here deliver me to my sour cross , and water can not wash away your sin .
my lord , dispatch , read these articles .
mine eyes are full of tears , i can not see and yet salt water blinds them not so much but they can see a sort of traitors here .
nay , if i turn mine eyes upon myself , i find myself a traitor with the rest , for i have given here my soul consent to undeck the pompous body of a king , made glory base and sovereignty a slave , proud majesty a subject , state a peasant .
my lord , no lord of thine , thou haught insulting man , nor no man lord , i have no name , no title , no , not that name was given me at the font , but is usurp alack the heavy day , that i have worn so many winters out , and know not now what name to call myself !
o that i were a mockery king of snow , standing before the sun of bolingbroke , to melt myself away in !
good king , great king , and yet not greatly good , an if my word be sterling yet in england , let it command a mirror hither straight , that it may show me what a face i have , since it is bankrupt of his majesty .

attendant , with a glass give me the glass , and therein will i read .
no deeper wrinkles yet ?
hath sorrow struck so many blows upon this face of mine , and made no deeper wounds ?
o flattering glass , like to my followers in prosperity , thou dost beguile me !
was this face the face that every day under his household roof did keep ten thousand men ?
was this the face that , like the sun , did make beholders wink ?
was this the face that faced so many follies , and was at last by bolingbroke ?
a brittle glory shineth in this face as brittle as the glory is the face , dashes the glass against the ground for there it is , crack in a hundred shivers .
mark , silent king , the moral of this sport , how soon my sorrow hath destroy my face .
the shadow of your sorrow hath destroy the shadow or your face .
say that again .
the shadow of my sorrow !
ha !
let see is very true , my grief lies all within , and these external manners of laments are merely shadows to the unseen grief that swells with silence in the tortured soul , there lies the substance and i thank thee , king , for thy great bounty , that not only givest me cause to wail but teachest me the way how to lament the cause .
i beg one boon , and then be gone and trouble you no more .
shall i obtain it ?
name it , fair cousin .
cousin ' ?
i am greater than a king for when i was a king , my flatterers were then but subjects , being now a subject , i have a king here to my flatterer .
being so great , i have no need to beg .
yet ask .
and shall i have ?
you shall .
then give me leave to go .

enter king richard ii and guard but soft , but see , or rather do not see , my fair rose wither yet look up , behold , that you in pity may dissolve to dew , and wash him fresh again with tears .
ah , thou , the model where old troy did stand , thou map of honour , thou king richard tomb , and not king richard , thou most beauteous inn , why should grief be lodged in thee , when triumph is become an alehouse guest ?
join not with grief , fair woman , do not so , to make my end too sudden learn , good soul , to think our former state a happy dream , from which awaked , the truth of what we are shows us but this i am sworn brother , sweet , to grim necessity , and he and i will keep a league till death .
hie thee to france and cloister thee in some religious house our holy lives must win a new world crown , which our profane hours here have stricken down .
what , is my richard both in shape and mind transform and weaken ?
hath bolingbroke deposed thine intellect ?
hath he been in thy heart ?
the lion dying thrusteth forth his paw , and wounds the earth , if nothing else , with rage to be , and wilt thou , , take thy correction mildly , kiss the rod , and fawn on rage with base humility , which art a lion and a king of beasts ?
a king of beasts , indeed , if aught but beasts , i had been still a happy king of men .
good sometime queen , prepare thee hence for france think i am dead and that even here thou takest , as from my , thy last living leave .
in winter tedious nights sit by the fire with good old folks and let them tell thee tales of woeful ages long ago betid , and ere thou bid good night , to quit their griefs , tell thou the lamentable tale of me and send the hearers weeping to their beds for why , the senseless brands will sympathize the heavy accent of thy moving tongue and in compassion weep the fire out , and some will mourn in ashes , some , for the deposing of a rightful king .
enter northumberland and others my lord , the mind of bolingbroke is changed you must to pomfret , not unto the tower .
and , madam , there is order for you , with all swift speed you must away to france .
northumberland , thou ladder wherewithal the mounting bolingbroke ascends my throne , the time shall not be many hours of age more than it is ere foul sin gathering head shalt break into corruption thou shalt think , though he divide the realm and give thee half , it is too little , helping him to all , and he shall think that thou , which the way to plant unrightful kings , wilt know again , being so little urged , another way to pluck him headlong from the usurped throne .
the love of wicked men converts to fear , that fear to hate , and hate turns one or both to worthy danger and deserved death .
my guilt be on my head , and there an end .
take leave and part , for you must part forthwith .
doubly divorced !
bad men , you violate a twofold marriage , my crown and me , and then betwixt me and my married wife .
let me unkiss the oath thee and me , and yet not so , for with a kiss was made .
part us , northumberland , i toward the north , where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime , my wife to france from whence , set forth in pomp , she came adorned hither like sweet may , sent back like hallowmas or of day .
and must we be divided ?
must we part ?
ay , hand from hand , my love , and heart from heart .
banish us both and send the king with me .
that were some love but little policy .
then whither he goes , thither let me go .
so two , together weeping , make one woe .
weep thou for me in france , i for thee here , better far off than near , be the near .
go , count thy way with sighs , i mine with groans .
so longest way shall have the longest moans .
twice for one step i groan , the way being short , and piece the way out with a heavy heart .
come , come , in wooing sorrow let be brief , since , wedding it , there is such length in grief , one kiss shall stop our mouths , and dumbly part , thus give i mine , and thus take i thy heart .
give me mine own again , no good part to take on me to keep and kill thy heart .
so , now i have mine own again , be gone , that i might strive to kill it with a groan .
we make woe wanton with this fond delay once more , adieu , the rest let sorrow say .

where did i leave ?
at that sad stop , my lord , where rude misgovern hands from windows ' tops threw dust and rubbish on king richard head .
then , as i said , the duke , great bolingbroke , mounted upon a hot and fiery steed which his aspiring rider seem to know , with slow but stately pace kept on his course , whilst all tongues cried save thee , bolingbroke ! '
you would have thought the very windows spake , so many greedy looks of young and old through casements darted their desiring eyes upon his visage , and that all the walls with painted imagery had said at once preserve thee !
welcome , bolingbroke ! '
whilst he , from the one side to the other turning , bareheaded , lower than his proud steed neck , bespake them thus ' i thank you , countrymen ' and thus still doing , thus he pass along .
alack , poor richard !
where rode he the whilst ?
as in a theatre , the eyes of men , after a actor leaves the stage , are idly bent on him that enters next , thinking his prattle to be tedious , even so , or with much more contempt , men eyes did scowl on gentle richard , no man cried save him ! '
no joyful tongue gave him his welcome home but dust was thrown upon his sacred head which with such gentle sorrow he shook off , his face still combating with tears and smiles , the badges of his grief and patience , that had not god , for some strong purpose , steel the hearts of men , they must perforce have melted and barbarism itself have pitied him .
but heaven hath a hand in these events , to whose high will we bound our calm contents .
to bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now , whose state and honour i for aye allow .
here comes my son aumerle .

wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own ?
have we more sons ?
or are we like to have ?
is not my teeming date drunk up with time ?
and wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age , and rob me of a happy mother name ?
is he not like thee ?
is he not thine own ?
thou fond mad woman , wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy ?
a dozen of them here have the sacrament , and interchangeably set down their hands , to kill the king at oxford .
he shall be none , we keep him here then what is that to him ?
away , fond woman !
were he twenty times my son , i would appeach him .
hadst thou groan for him as i have done , thou wouldst be more pitiful .
but now i know thy mind , thou dost suspect that i have been disloyal to thy bed , and that he is a bastard , not thy son sweet york , sweet husband , be not of that mind he is as like thee as a man may be , not like to me , or any of my kin , and yet i love him .
make way , unruly woman !
exit after , aumerle !
mount thee upon his horse , spur post , and get before him to the king , and beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee .
i not be long behind , though i be old , i doubt not but to ride as fast as york and never will i rise up from the ground till bolingbroke have pardon thee .

is full three months since i did see him last , if any plague hang over us , is he .
i would to god , my lords , he might be found inquire at london , the taverns there , for there , they say , he daily doth frequent , with unrestrained loose companions , even such , they say , as stand in narrow lanes , and beat our watch , and rob our passengers , which he , young wanton and effeminate boy , takes on the point of honour to support so dissolute a crew .
my lord , some two days since i saw the prince , and told him of those triumphs held at oxford .
and what said the gallant ?
his answer was , he would unto the stews , and from the creature pluck a glove , and wear it as a favour , and with that he would unhorse the lustiest challenger .
as dissolute as desperate , yet through both i see some sparks of better hope , which elder years may happily bring forth .
but who comes here ?

peruse this writing here , and thou shalt know the treason that my haste forbids me show .

i tore it from the traitor bosom , king , fear , and not love , begets his penitence forget to pity him , lest thy pity prove a serpent that will sting thee to the heart .
o heinous , strong and bold conspiracy !
o loyal father of a treacherous son !
thou sheer , immaculate and silver fountain , from when this stream through muddy passages hath held his current and defiled himself !
thy overflow of good converts to bad , and thy abundant goodness shall excuse this deadly blot in thy digressing son .
so shall my virtue be his vice bawd , and he shall spend mine honour with his shame , as thriftless sons their scraping fathers ' gold .
mine honour lives when his dishonour dies , or my shamed life in his dishonour lies thou me in his life , giving him breath , the traitor lives , the true man put to death .

unto my mother prayers i bend my knee .
against them both my true joints bended be .
ill mayst thou thrive , if thou grant any grace !
pleads he in earnest ?
look upon his face , his eyes do drop no tears , his prayers are in jest , his words come from his mouth , ours from our breast he prays but faintly and would be denied , we pray with heart and soul and all beside his weary joints would gladly rise , i know , our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow his prayers are full of false hypocrisy , ours of true zeal and deep integrity .
our prayers do his , then let them have that mercy which true prayer ought to have .
good aunt , stand up .
nay , do not say , up , ' say , ' first , and afterwards up . '
and if i were thy nurse , thy tongue to teach , ' should be the first word of thy speech .

dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy ?
ah , my sour husband , my lord , that the word itself against the word !
speak ' as is current in our land , the chopping french we do not understand .
thine eye begins to speak , set thy tongue there , or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear , that hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce , pity may move thee ' to rehearse .
good aunt , stand up .
i do not sue to stand , pardon is all the suit i have in hand .
i pardon him , as god shall pardon me .
o happy vantage of a kneeling knee !
yet am i sick for fear speak it again , twice saying ' doth not pardon twain , but makes one pardon strong .
with all my heart i pardon him .
a god on earth thou art .
but for our trusty and the abbot , with all the rest of that consorted crew , destruction straight shall dog them at the heels .
good uncle , help to order several powers to oxford , or these traitors are they shall not live within this world , i swear , but i will have them , if i once know where .

exeunt scene pomfret castle .
enter king richard i have been studying how i may compare this prison where i live unto the world and for because the world is populous and here is not a creature but myself , i can not do it , yet i hammer it out .
my brain i prove the female to my soul , my soul the father , and these two beget a generation of thoughts , and these same thoughts people this little world , in humours like the people of this world , for no thought is contented .
the better sort , as thoughts of things divine , are intermix with scruples and do set the word itself against the word as thus , , little ones , ' and then again , is as hard to come as for a camel to thread the postern of a small needle eye . '
thoughts tending to ambition , they do plot unlikely wonders , how these vain weak nails may tear a passage through the flinty ribs of this hard world , my ragged prison walls , and , for they can not , die in their own pride .
thoughts tending to content flatter themselves that they are not the first of fortune slaves , nor shall not be the last , like silly beggars who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame , that many have and others must sit there , and in this thought they find a kind of ease , bearing their own misfortunes on the back of such as have before endured the like .
thus play i in one person many people , and none contented sometimes am i king , then treasons make me wish myself a beggar , and so i am then crushing penury persuades me i was better when a king , then am i king again and by and by think that i am unking by bolingbroke , and straight am nothing but i be , nor i nor any man that but man is with nothing shall be pleased , till he be eased with being nothing .
music do i hear ?
music ha , ha !
keep time how sour sweet music is , when time is broke and no proportion kept !
so is it in the music of men lives .
and here have i the daintiness of ear to cheque time broke in a disorder string , but for the concord of my state and time had not an ear to hear my true time broke .
i wasted time , and now doth time waste me , for now hath time made me his numbering clock my thoughts are minutes , and with sighs they jar their watches on unto mine eyes , the outward watch , whereto my finger , like a dial point , is pointing still , in cleansing them from tears .
now sir , the sound that tells what hour it is are clamorous groans , which strike upon my heart , which is the bell so sighs and tears and groans show minutes , times , and hours but my time runs posting on in bolingbroke proud joy , while i stand fooling here , his jack o ' the clock .
this music mads me , let it sound no more , for though it have holp madmen to their wits , in me it seems it will make wise men mad .
yet blessing on his heart that gives it me !
for is a sign of love , and love to richard is a strange brooch in this world .

thanks , noble peer , the cheapest of us is ten groats too dear .

and how comest thou hither , where no man never comes but that sad dog that brings me food to make misfortune live ?
i was a poor groom of thy stable , king , when thou wert king , who , travelling towards york , with much ado at length have gotten leave to look upon my sometimes royal master face .
o , how it yearn my heart when i beheld in london streets , that , when bolingbroke rode on roan barbary , that horse that thou so often hast bestrid , that horse that i so carefully have dress !
rode he on barbary ?
tell me , gentle friend , how went he under him ?
so proudly as if he disdain the ground .
so proud that bolingbroke was on his back !
that jade hath eat bread from my royal hand , this hand hath made him proud with clapping him .
would he not stumble ?
would he not fall down , since pride must have a fall , and break the neck of that proud man that did usurp his back ?
forgiveness , horse !
why do i rail on thee , since thou , created to be awed by man , wast born to bear ?
i was not made a horse , and yet i bear a burthen like an ass , spurr , gall and tired by jouncing bolingbroke .

now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths , our bruised arms hung up for monuments , our stern alarums changed to merry meetings , our dreadful marches to delightful measures .
war hath smooth his wrinkled front , and now , instead of mounting barded steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries , he capers nimbly in a lady chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute .
but i , that am not shaped for sportive tricks , nor made to court an amorous , i , that am rudely stamp , and want love majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph , i , that am curtail of this fair proportion , cheated of feature by dissembling nature , deformed , unfinish , sent before my time into this breathing world , scarce half made up , and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them , why , i , in this weak piping time of peace , have no delight to pass away the time , unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore , since i can not prove a lover , to entertain these fair days , i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days .
plots have i laid , inductions dangerous , by drunken prophecies , libels and dreams , to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle , false and treacherous , this day should clarence closely be mew up , about a prophecy , which says that ' g ' of edward heirs the murderer shall be .

enter clarence , guarded , and brakenbury brother , good day , what means this armed guard that waits upon your grace ?
his majesty tendering my person safety , hath appointed this conduct to convey me to the tower .
upon what cause ?
because my name is george .
alack , my lord , that fault is none of yours , he should , for that , commit your godfathers o , belike his majesty hath some intent that you shall be in the tower .
but what the matter , clarence ?
may i know ?
yea , richard , when i know , for i protest as yet i do not but , as i can learn , he hearkens after prophecies and dreams , and from the plucks the letter and says a wizard told him that by g his issue disinherited should be , and , for my name of george begins with g , it follows in his thought that i am he .
these , as i learn , and such like toys as these have moved his highness to commit me now .
why , this it is , when men are ruled by women is not the king that sends you to the tower my lady grey his wife , clarence , is she that tempers him to this extremity .
was it not she and that good man of worship , anthony woodville , her brother there , that made him send lord hastings to the tower , from whence this present day he is deliver ?
we are not safe , clarence , we are not safe .
by heaven , i think there no man is secure but the queen kindred and heralds that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore .
heard ye not what an humble suppliant lord hastings was to her for his delivery ?
humbly complaining to her deity got my lord chamberlain his liberty .
i tell you what , i think it is our way , if we will keep in favour with the king , to be her men and wear her livery the jealous widow and herself , since that our brother dubb them gentlewomen .
are mighty gossips in this monarchy .
i beseech your graces both to pardon me , his majesty hath straitly given in charge that no man shall have private conference , of what degree soever , with his brother .
even so , a please your worship , brakenbury , you may partake of any thing we say we speak no treason , man we say the king is wise and virtuous , and his noble queen well struck in years , fair , and not jealous , we say that shore wife hath a pretty foot , a cherry lip , a bonny eye , a passing pleasing tongue , and that the queen kindred are made how say you sir ?
can you deny all this ?
with this , my lord , myself have nought to do .
naught to do with mistress shore !
i tell thee , fellow , he that doth naught with her , excepting one , were best he do it secretly , alone .
what one , my lord ?
her husband , knave wouldst thou betray me ?
i beseech your grace to pardon me , and withal forbear your conference with the noble duke .
we know thy charge , brakenbury , and will obey .
we are the queen abjects , and must obey .
brother , farewell i will unto the king , and whatsoever you will employ me in , were it to call king edward widow sister , i will perform it to enfranchise you .
meantime , this deep disgrace in brotherhood touches me deeper than you can imagine .
i know it pleaseth neither of us well .
well , your imprisonment shall not be long , meantime , have patience .
i must perforce .
farewell .
exeunt clarence , brakenbury , and guard go , tread the path that thou shalt return .
simple , plain clarence !
i do love thee so , that i will shortly send thy soul to heaven , if heaven will take the present at our hands .
but who comes here ?
the hastings ?
enter hastings good time of day unto my gracious lord !
as much unto my good lord chamberlain !
well are you welcome to the open air .
how hath your lordship brook imprisonment ?
with patience , noble lord , as prisoners must but i shall live , my lord , to give them thanks that were the cause of my imprisonment .
no doubt , no doubt , and so shall clarence too , for they that were your enemies are his , and have prevail as much on him as you .
more pity that the eagle should be mew , while kites and buzzards prey at liberty .
what news abroad ?
no news so bad abroad as this at home , the king is sickly , weak and melancholy , and his physicians fear him mightily .
now , by saint paul , this news is bad indeed .
o , he hath kept an evil diet long , and overmuch consumed his royal person is very grievous to be thought upon .
what , is he in his bed ?
he is .
go you before , and i will follow you .
exit hastings he can not live , i hope , and must not die till george be pack with up to heaven .
i in , to urge his hatred more to clarence , with lies well steel with weighty arguments , and , if i fall not in my deep intent , clarence hath not another day to live which done , god take king edward to his mercy , and leave the world for me to bustle in !
for then i marry warwick youngest daughter .
what though i kill her husband and her father ?
the readiest way to make the wench amends is to become her husband and her father the which will i , not all so much for love as for another secret close intent , by marrying her which i must reach unto .
but yet i run before my horse to market clarence still breathes , edward still lives and reigns when they are gone , then must i count my gains .
exit scene ii .
the same .
another street .
enter the corpse of king henry the sixth , gentlemen with halberds to guard it , lady anne being the mourner set down , set down your honourable load , if honour may be shrouded in a hearse , whilst i awhile obsequiously lament the untimely fall of virtuous lancaster .
poor figure of a holy king !
pale ashes of the house of lancaster !
thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood !
be it lawful that i invocate thy ghost , to hear the lamentations of poor anne , wife to thy edward , to thy slaughter son , stabb by the selfsame hand that made these wounds !
lo , in these windows that let forth thy life , i pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes .
cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes !
cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it !
cursed the blood that let this blood from hence !
more direful hap betide that hated wretch , that makes us wretched by the death of thee , than i can wish to adders , spiders , toads , or any creeping venom thing that lives !
if ever he have child , abortive be it , prodigious , and untimely brought to light , whose ugly and unnatural aspect may fright the hopeful mother at the view , and that be heir to his unhappiness !
if ever he have wife , let her he made a miserable by the death of him as i am made by my poor lord and thee !
come , now towards chertsey with your holy load , taken from paul to be interred there , and still , as you are weary of the weight , rest you , whiles i lament king henry corse .
enter gloucester stay , you that bear the corse , and set it down .
what black magician conjures up this fiend , to stop devoted charitable deeds ?
villains , set down the corse , or , by saint paul , i make a corse of him that disobeys .
my lord , stand back , and let the coffin pass .
unmanner dog !
stand thou , when i command advance thy halbert higher than my breast , or , by saint paul , i strike thee to my foot , and spurn upon thee , beggar , for thy boldness .
what , do you tremble ?
are you all afraid ?
alas , i blame you not , for you are mortal , and mortal eyes can not endure the devil .
avaunt , thou dreadful minister of hell !
thou hadst but power over his mortal body , his soul thou canst not have , therefore be gone .
sweet saint , for charity , be not so curst .
foul devil , for god sake , hence , and trouble us not , for thou hast made the happy earth thy hell , fill it with cursing cries and deep exclaims .
if thou delight to view thy heinous deeds , behold this pattern of thy butcheries .
o , gentlemen , see , see !
dead henry wounds open their congeal mouths and bleed afresh !
blush , blush , thou lump of foul deformity , for is thy presence that exhales this blood from cold and empty veins , where no blood dwells , thy deed , inhuman and unnatural , provokes this deluge most unnatural .
o god , which this blood madest , revenge his death !
o earth , which this blood revenge his death !
either heaven with lightning strike the murderer dead , or earth , gape open wide and eat him quick , as thou dost swallow up this good king blood which his arm hath butchered !
lady , you know no rules of charity , which renders good for bad , blessings for curses .
villain , thou no law of god nor man no beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity .
but i know none , and therefore am no beast .
o wonderful , when devils tell the truth !
more wonderful , when angels are so angry .
vouchsafe , divine perfection of a woman , of these , to give me leave , by circumstance , but to acquit myself .
vouchsafe , defused infection of a man , for these known evils , but to give me leave , by circumstance , to curse thy cursed self .
fairer than tongue can name thee , let me have some patient leisure to excuse myself .
fouler than heart can think thee , thou canst make no excuse current , but to hang thyself .
by such despair , i should accuse myself .
and , by despairing , shouldst thou stand excused , for doing worthy vengeance on thyself , which didst unworthy slaughter upon others .
say that i slew them not ?
why , then they are not dead but dead they are , and devilish slave , by thee .
i did not kill your husband .
why , then he is alive .
nay , he is dead , and slain by edward hand .
in thy foul throat thou liest queen margaret saw thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood , the which thou once didst bend against her breast , but that thy brothers beat aside the point .
i was provoked by her slanderous tongue , which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders .
thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind .
which never dreamt on aught but butcheries didst thou not kill this king ?
i grant ye .
dost grant me , hedgehog ?
then , god grant me too thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed !
o , he was gentle , mild , and virtuous !
the fitter for the king of heaven , that hath him .
he is in heaven , where thou shalt never come .
let him thank me , that holp to send him thither , for he was fitter for that place than earth .
and thou unfit for any place but hell .
yes , one place else , if you will hear me name it .
some dungeon .
your .
i rest betide the chamber where thou liest !
so will it , madam till i lie with you .
i hope so .
i know so .
but , gentle lady anne , to leave this keen encounter of our wits , and fall somewhat into a slower method , is not the causer of the timeless deaths of these plantagenets , henry and edward , as blameful as the executioner ?
thou art the cause , and most accursed effect .
your beauty was the cause of that effect , your beauty which did haunt me in my sleep to undertake the death of all the world , so i might live one hour in your sweet bosom .
if i thought that , i tell thee , homicide , these nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks .
these eyes could never endure sweet beauty wreck , you should not blemish it , if i stood by as all the world is cheered by the sun , so i by that , it is my day , my life .
black night thy day , and death thy life !
curse not thyself , fair creature thou art both .
i would i were , to be revenged on thee .
it is a quarrel most unnatural , to be revenged on him that loveth you .
it is a quarrel just and reasonable , to be revenged on him that slew my husband .
he that bereft thee , lady , of thy husband , did it to help thee to a better husband .
his better doth not breathe upon the earth .
he lives that loves thee better than he could .
name him .
plantagenet .
why , that was he .
the selfsame name , but one of better nature .
where is he ?
here .
she spitteth at him why dost thou spit at me ?
would it were mortal poison , for thy sake !
never came poison from so sweet a place .
never hung poison on a fouler toad .
out of my sight !
thou dost infect my eyes .
thine eyes , sweet lady , have infected mine .
would they were basilisks , to strike thee dead !
i would they were , that i might die at once , for now they kill me with a living death .
those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears , shamed their aspect with store of childish drops these eyes that never shed remorseful tear , no , when my father york and edward wept , to hear the piteous moan that rutland made when clifford shook his sword at him , nor when thy warlike father , like a child , told the sad story of my father death , and twenty times made pause to sob and weep , that all the had wet their cheeks like trees bedash with rain in that sad time my manly eyes did scorn an humble tear , and what these sorrows could not thence exhale , thy beauty hath , and made them blind with weeping .
i never sued to friend nor enemy , my tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word , but now thy beauty is proposed my fee , my proud heart sues , and prompts my tongue to speak .
she looks scornfully at him teach not thy lips such scorn , for they were made for kissing , lady , not for such contempt .
if thy revengeful heart can not forgive , lo , here i lend thee this sword , which if thou please to hide in this true bosom .
and let the soul forth that adoreth thee , i lay it naked to the deadly stroke , and humbly beg the death upon my knee .
he lays his breast open she offers at it with his sword nay , do not pause , for i did kill king henry , but was thy beauty that provoked me .
nay , now dispatch , was i that stabb young edward , but was thy heavenly face that set me on .
here she lets fall the sword take up the sword again , or take up me .
arise , dissembler though i wish thy death , i will not be the executioner .
then bid me kill myself , and i will do it .
i have already .
tush , that was in thy rage speak it again , and , even with the word , that hand , which , for thy love , did kill thy love , shall , for thy love , kill a far truer love , to both their deaths thou shalt be accessary .
i would i knew thy heart .
is figured in my tongue .
i fear me both are false .
then never man was true .
well , well , put up your sword .
say , then , my peace is made .
that shall you know hereafter .
but shall i live in hope ?
all men , i hope , live so .
vouchsafe to wear this ring .
to take is not to give .
look , how this ring encompasseth finger .
even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart , wear both of them , for both of them are thine .
and if thy poor devoted suppliant may but beg one favour at thy gracious hand , thou dost confirm his happiness for ever .
what is it ?
that it would please thee leave these sad designs to him that hath more cause to be a mourner , and presently repair to crosby place , where , after i have solemnly interr at chertsey monastery this noble king , and wet his grave with my repentant tears , i will with all expedient duty see you for divers unknown reasons .
i beseech you , grant me this boon .
with all my heart , and much it joys me too , to see you are become so penitent .
tressel and berkeley , go along with me .
bid me farewell .
is more than you deserve , but since you teach me how to flatter you , imagine i have said farewell already .
exeunt lady anne , tressel , and berkeley sirs , take up the corse .
towards chertsey , noble lord ?
no , to , there attend my coining .
exeunt all but gloucester was ever woman in this humour woo ?
was ever woman in this humour won ?
i have her , but i will not keep her long .
what !
i , that kill her husband and his father , to take her in her heart extremest hate , with curses in her mouth , tears in her eyes , the bleeding witness of her hatred by , having god , her conscience , and these bars against me , and i nothing to back my suit at all , but the plain devil and dissembling looks , and yet to win her , all the world to nothing !
ha !
hath she forgot already that brave prince , edward , her lord , whom i , some three months since , stabb in my angry mood at tewksbury ?
a sweeter and a lovelier gentleman , framed in the prodigality of nature , young , valiant , wise , and , no doubt , right royal , the spacious world can not again afford and will she yet debase her eyes on me , that cropp the golden prime of this sweet prince , and made her widow to a woful bed ?
on me , whose all not equals edward moiety ?
on me , that halt and am unshapen thus ?
my dukedom to a beggarly denier , i do mistake my person all this while upon my life , she finds , although i can not , myself to be a marvellous proper man .
i be at charges for a , and entertain some score or two of tailors , to study fashions to adorn my body since i am crept in favour with myself , will maintain it with some little cost .
but first i turn yon fellow in his grave , and then return lamenting to my love .
shine out , fair sun , till i have bought a glass , that i may see my shadow as i pass .
exit scene iii .
the palace .
enter queen elizabeth , rivers , and grey have patience , madam there no doubt his majesty will soon recover his accustom health .
in that you brook it in , it makes him worse therefore , for god sake , entertain good comfort , and cheer his grace with quick and merry words .
if he were dead , what would betide of me ?
no other harm but loss of such a lord .
the loss of such a lord includes all harm .
the heavens have bless you with a goodly son , to be your comforter when he is gone .
oh , he is young and his minority is put unto the trust of richard gloucester , a man that loves not me , nor none of you .
is it concluded that he shall be protector ?
it is determined , not concluded yet but so it must be , if the king miscarry .
enter buckingham and derby here come the lords of buckingham and derby .
good time of day unto your royal grace !
god make your majesty joyful as you have been !
the countess richmond , good my lord of derby .
to your good prayers will scarcely say amen .
yet , derby , notwithstanding she your wife , and loves not me , be you , good lord , assured i hate not you for her proud arrogance .
i do beseech you , either not believe the envious slanders of her false accusers , or , if she be accused in true report , bear with her weakness , which , i think proceeds from wayward sickness , and no grounded malice .
saw you the king , my lord of derby ?
but now the duke of buckingham and i are come from visiting his majesty .
what likelihood of his amendment , lords ?
madam , good hope , his grace speaks cheerfully .
god grant him health !
did you confer with him ?
madam , we did he desires to make atonement betwixt the duke of gloucester and your brothers , and betwixt them and my lord chamberlain , and sent to warn them to his royal presence .
would all were well !
but that will never be i fear our happiness is at the highest .
enter gloucester , hastings , and dorset they do me wrong , and i will not endure it who are they that complain unto the king , that i , forsooth , am stern , and love them not ?
by holy paul , they love his grace but lightly that fill his ears with such dissentious rumours .
because i can not flatter and speak fair , smile in men faces , smooth , deceive and cog , duck with french nods and apish courtesy , i must be held a rancorous enemy .
can not a plain man live and think no harm , but thus his simple truth must be abused by silken , sly , insinuating jacks ?
to whom in all this presence speaks your grace ?
to thee , that hast nor honesty nor grace .
when have i injured thee ?
when done thee wrong ?
or thee ?
or thee ?
or any of your faction ?
a plague upon you all !
his royal person , whom god preserve better than you would wish ! can not be quiet scarce a , but you must trouble him with lewd complaints .
brother of gloucester , you mistake the matter .
the king , of his own royal disposition , and not provoked by any suitor else , aiming , belike , at your interior hatred , which in your outward actions shows itself against my kindred , brothers , and myself , makes him to send , that thereby he may gather the ground of your , and so remove it .
i can not tell the world is grown so bad , that wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch since every jack became a gentleman there many a gentle person made a jack .
come , come , we know your meaning , brother gloucester , you envy my advancement and my friends ' god grant we never may have need of you !
meantime , god grants that we have need of you your brother is imprison by your means , myself disgraced , and the nobility held in contempt , whilst many fair promotions are daily given to ennoble those that scarce , some two days since , were worth a noble .
by him that raised me to this careful height from that contented hap which i enjoy , i never did incense his majesty against the duke of clarence , but have been an earnest advocate to plead for him .
my lord , you do me shameful injury , falsely to draw me in these vile suspects .
you may deny that you were not the cause of my lord hastings ' late imprisonment .
she may , my lord , for she may , lord rivers !
why , who knows not so ?
she may do more , sir , than denying that she may help you to many fair preferments , and then deny her aiding hand therein , and lay those honours on your high deserts .
what may she not ?
she may , yea , marry , may she what , marry , may she ?
what , marry , may she !
marry with a king , a bachelor , a handsome stripling too i wis your grandam had a worser match .
my lord of gloucester , i have too long borne your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs by heaven , i will acquaint his majesty with those gross taunts i often have endured .
i had rather be a country than a great queen , with this condition , to be thus taunted , scorn , and baited at enter queen margaret , behind small joy have i in being england queen .
and lessen be that small , god , i beseech thee !
thy honour , state and seat is due to me .
what !
threat you me with telling of the king ?
tell him , and spare not look , what i have said i will avouch in presence of the king i dare adventure to be sent to the tower .
is time to speak , my pains are quite forgot .
out , devil !
i remember them too well thou slewest my husband henry in the tower , and edward , my poor son , at tewksbury .
ere you were queen , yea , or your husband king , i was a in his great affairs , a of his proud adversaries , a liberal rewarder of his friends to royalize his blood i spilt mine own .
yea , and much better blood than his or thine .
in all which time you and your husband grey were factious for the house of lancaster , and , rivers , so were you .
was not your husband in margaret battle at saint alban slain ?
let me put in your minds , if you forget , what you have been ere now , and what you are , withal , what i have been , and what i am .
a murderous villain , and so still thou art .
poor clarence did forsake his father , warwick , yea , and forswore himself , which jesu pardon ! which god revenge !
to fight on edward party for the crown , and for his meed , poor lord , he is mew up .
i would to god my heart were flint , like edward , or edward soft and pitiful , like mine i am too for this world .
hie thee to hell for shame , and leave the world , thou cacodemon !
there thy kingdom is .
my lord of gloucester , in those busy days which here you urge to prove us enemies , we follow then our lord , our lawful king so should we you , if you should be our king .
if i should be !
i had rather be a pedlar far be it from my heart , the thought of it !
as little joy , my lord , as you suppose you should enjoy , were you this country king , as little joy may you suppose in me .
that i enjoy , being the queen thereof .
a little joy enjoys the queen thereof , for i am she , and altogether joyless .
i can no longer hold me patient .
advancing hear me , you wrangling pirates , that fall out in sharing that which you have pill from me !
which of you trembles not that looks on me ?
if not , that , i being queen , you bow like subjects , yet that , by you deposed , you quake like rebels ?
o gentle villain , do not turn away !
foul wrinkled witch , what makest thou in my sight ?
but repetition of what thou hast marr , that will i make before i let thee go .
wert thou not banished on pain of death ?
i was , but i do find more pain in banishment than death can yield me here by my abode .
a husband and a son thou owest to me , and thou a kingdom , all of you allegiance the sorrow that i have , by right is yours , and all the pleasures you usurp are mine .
the curse my noble father laid on thee , when thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper and with thy scorns rivers from his eyes , and then , to dry them , gavest the duke a clout steep in the faultless blood of pretty rutland his curses , then from bitterness of soul denounced against thee , are all upon thee , and god , not we , hath plagued thy bloody deed .
so just is god , to right the innocent .
o , was the foulest deed to slay that babe , and the most merciless that was heard of !
tyrants themselves wept when it was reported .
no man but prophesied revenge for it .
northumberland , then present , wept to see it .
what were you snarling all before i came , ready to catch each other by the throat , and turn you all your hatred now on me ?
did york dread curse prevail so much with heaven ?
that henry death , my lovely edward death , their kingdom loss , my woful banishment , could all but answer for that peevish brat ?
can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven ?
why , then , give way , dull clouds , to my quick curses !
if not by war , by surfeit die your king , as ours by murder , to make him a king !
edward thy son , which now is prince of wales , for edward my son , which was prince of wales , die in his youth by like untimely violence !
thyself a queen , for me that was a queen , outlive thy glory , like my wretched self !
long mayst thou live to wail thy children loss , and see another , as i see thee now , deck in thy rights , as thou art stall in mine !
long die thy happy days before thy death , and , after many lengthen hours of grief , die neither mother , wife , nor england queen !
rivers and dorset , you were standers by , and so wast thou , lord hastings , when my son was stabb with bloody daggers god , i pray him , that none of you may live your natural age , but by some unlook accident cut off !
have done thy charm , thou hateful wither hag !
and leave out thee ?
stay , dog , for thou shalt hear me .
if heaven have any grievous plague in store exceeding those that i can wish upon thee , o , let them keep it till thy sins be ripe , and then hurl down their indignation on thee , the troubler of the poor world peace !
the worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul !
thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest , and take deep traitors for thy dearest friends !
no sleep close up that deadly eye of thine , unless it be whilst some tormenting dream affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils !
thou , abortive , rooting hog !
thou that wast seal in thy nativity the slave of nature and the son of hell !
thou slander of thy mother heavy womb !
thou loathed issue of thy father loins !
thou rag of honour !
thou detested margaret .
richard !
ha !
i call thee not .
i cry thee mercy then , for i had thought that thou hadst call me all these bitter names .
why , so i did , but look for no reply .
o , let me make the period to my curse !
is done by me , and ends in . '
thus have you breathed your curse against yourself .
poor painted queen , vain flourish of my fortune !
why thou sugar on that bottled spider , whose deadly web ensnareth thee about ?
fool , fool !
thou a knife to kill thyself .
the time will come when thou shalt wish for me to help thee curse that poisonous bunchback toad .
woman , end thy frantic curse , lest to thy harm thou move our patience .
foul shame upon you !
you have all moved mine .
were you well served , you would be taught your duty .
to serve me well , you all should do me duty , teach me to be your queen , and you my subjects o , serve me well , and teach yourselves that duty !
dispute not with her , she is lunatic .
peace , master marquess , you are malapert your stamp of honour is scarce current .
o , that your young nobility could judge what to lose it , and be miserable !
they that stand high have many blasts to shake them , and if they fall , they dash themselves to pieces .
good counsel , marry learn it , learn it , marquess .
it toucheth you , my lord , as much as me .
yea , and much more but i was born so high , our aery buildeth in the cedar top , and dallies with the wind and scorns the sun .
and turns the sun to shade , alas !
alas !
witness my son , now in the shade of death , whose bright beams thy cloudy wrath hath in eternal darkness folded up .
your aery buildeth in our aery nest .
o god , that seest it , do not suffer it !
as it was won with blood , lost be it so !
have done !
for shame , if not for charity .
urge neither charity nor shame to me uncharitably with me have you dealt , and shamefully by you my hopes are butcher .
my charity is outrage , life my shame and in that shame still live my sorrow rage .
have done , have done .
o princely buckingham i kiss thy hand , in sign of league and amity with thee now fair befal thee and thy noble house !
thy garments are not spotted with our blood , nor thou within the compass of my curse .
nor no one here , for curses never pass the lips of those that breathe them in the air .
i not believe but they ascend the sky , and there awake god peace .
o buckingham , take heed of yonder dog !
look , when he fawns , he bites , and when he bites , his venom tooth will rankle to the death have not to do with him , beware of him , sin , death , and hell have set their marks on him , and all their ministers attend on him .
what doth she say , my lord of buckingham ?
nothing that i respect , my gracious lord .
what , dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel ?
and soothe the devil that i warn thee from ?
o , but remember this another day , when he shall split thy very heart with sorrow , and say poor margaret was a prophetess !
live each of you the subjects to his hate , and he to yours , and all of you to god !
exit my hair doth stand on end to hear her curses .
and so doth mine i muse why she at liberty .
i can not blame her by god holy mother , she hath had too much wrong , and i repent my part thereof that i have done to her .
i never did her any , to my knowledge .
but you have all the vantage of her wrong .
i was too hot to do somebody good , that is too cold in thinking of it now .
marry , as for clarence , he is well repaid , he is frank up to fatting for his pains god pardon them that are the cause of it !
a virtuous and a conclusion , to pray for them that have done scathe to us .
so do i ever aside being .
for had i cursed now , i had cursed myself .
enter catesby madam , his majesty doth call for you , and for your grace , and you , my noble lords .
catesby , we come .
lords , will you go with us ?
madam , we will attend your grace .
exeunt all but gloucester i do the wrong , and first begin to brawl .
the secret mischiefs that i set abroach i lay unto the grievous charge of others .
clarence , whom i , indeed , have laid in darkness , i do beweep to many simple gulls namely , to hastings , derby , buckingham , and say it is the queen and her allies that stir the king against the duke my brother .
now , they believe it , and withal whet me to be revenged on rivers , vaughan , grey but then i sigh , and , with a piece of scripture , tell them that god bids us do good for evil and thus i clothe my naked villany with old odd ends stolen out of holy writ , and seem a saint , when most i play the devil .
enter two murderers but , soft !
here come my executioners .
how now , my hardy , stout resolved mates !
are you now going to dispatch this deed ?
we are , my lord , and come to have the warrant that we may be admitted where he is .
well thought upon , i have it here about me .
gives the warrant when you have done , repair to crosby place .
but , sirs , be sudden in the execution , withal obdurate , do not hear him plead , for clarence is , and perhaps may move your hearts to pity if you mark him .
tush !
fear not , my lord , we will not stand to prate , talkers are no good doers be assured we come to use our hands and not our tongues .
your eyes drop millstones , when fools ' eyes drop tears i like you , lads , about your business straight , go , go , dispatch .
we will , my noble lord .
exeunt scene iv .
london .
the tower .
enter clarence and brakenbury why looks your grace so heavily today ?
o , i have pass a miserable night , so full of ugly sights , of ghastly dreams , that , as i am a christian faithful man , i would not spend another such a night , though to buy a world of happy days , so full of dismal terror was the time !
what was your dream ?
i long to hear you tell it .
methoughts that i had broken from the tower , and was embark to cross to burgundy , and , in my company , my brother gloucester , who from my cabin tempted me to walk upon the hatches thence we looked toward england , and cited up a thousand fearful times , during the wars of york and lancaster that had us .
as we paced along upon the giddy footing of the hatches , methought that gloucester stumbled , and , in falling , struck me , that thought to stay him , overboard , into the tumbling billows of the main .
lord , lord !
methought , what pain it was to drown !
what dreadful noise of waters in mine ears !
what ugly sights of death within mine eyes !
methought i saw a thousand fearful wrecks , ten thousand men that fishes gnaw upon , wedges of gold , great anchors , heaps of pearl , inestimable stones , unvalued jewels , all scatter in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead men skulls , and , in those holes where eyes did once inhabit , there were crept , as in scorn of eyes , reflecting gems , which woo the slimy bottom of the deep , and mock the dead bones that lay scatter by .
had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon the secrets of the deep ?
methought i had , and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood kept in my soul , and would not let it forth to seek the empty , vast and wandering air , but smother it within my panting bulk , which almost burst to belch it in the sea .
awaked you not with this sore agony ?
o , no , my dream was lengthen after life , o , then began the tempest to my soul , who pass , methought , the melancholy flood , with that grim ferryman which poets write of , unto the kingdom of perpetual night .
the first that there did greet my stranger soul , was my great , renowned warwick , who cried aloud , scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence ? '
and so he vanish then came wandering by a shadow like an angel , with bright hair dabbled in blood , and he squeak out aloud , is come , false , fleeting , perjured clarence , that stabb me in the field by tewksbury , seize on him , furies , take him to your torments ! '
with that , methoughts , a legion of foul fiends environ me about , and howled in mine ears such hideous cries , that with the very noise i trembling waked , and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell , such terrible impression made the dream .
no marvel , my lord , though it affrighted you , i promise , i am afraid to hear you tell it .
o brakenbury , i have done those things , which now bear evidence against my soul , for edward sake , and see how he requites me !
o god !
if my deep prayers can not appease thee , but thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds , yet execute thy wrath in me alone , o , spare my guiltless wife and my poor children !
i pray thee , gentle keeper , stay by me , my soul is heavy , and i fain would sleep .
i will , my lord god give your grace good rest !
clarence sleeps sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours , makes the night morning , and the night .
princes have but their tides for their glories , an outward honour for an inward toil , and , for unfelt imagination , they often feel a world of restless cares so that , betwixt their tides and low names , there nothing differs but the outward fame .
enter the two murderers ho !
who here ?
in god name what are you , and how came you hither ?
i would speak with clarence , and i came hither on my legs .
yea , are you so brief ?
o sir , it is better to be brief than tedious .
show him our commission , talk no more .
brakenbury reads it i am , in this , commanded to deliver the noble duke of clarence to your hands i will not reason what is meant hereby , because i will be guiltless of the meaning .
here are the keys , there sits the duke asleep i to the king , and signify to him that thus i have resign my charge to you .
do so , it is a point of wisdom fare you well .
exit brakenbury what , shall we stab him as he sleeps ?
no , then he will say was done cowardly , when he wakes .
when he wakes !
why , fool , he shall never wake till the .
why , then he will say we stabbed him sleeping .
the urging of that word ' hath bred a kind of remorse in me .
what , art thou afraid ?
not to kill him , having a warrant for it , but to be damned for killing him , from which no warrant can defend us .
i thought thou hadst been resolute .
so i am , to let him live .
back to the duke of gloucester , tell him so .
i pray thee , stay a while i hope my holy humour will change , was wont to hold me but while one would tell twenty .
how dost thou feel thyself now ?
, some certain dregs of conscience are yet within me .
remember our reward , when the deed is done .
, he dies i had forgot the reward .
where is thy conscience now ?
in the duke of gloucester purse .
so when he opens his purse to give us our reward , thy conscience flies out .
let it go , there few or none will entertain it .
how if it come to thee again ?
i not meddle with it it is a dangerous thing it makes a man a coward a man can not steal , but it accuseth him , he can not swear , but it cheques him , he can not lie with his neighbour wife , but it detects him is a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man bosom , it fills one full of obstacles it made me once restore a purse of gold that i found , it beggars any man that keeps it it is turned out of all towns and cities for a dangerous thing , and every man that means to live well endeavours to trust to himself and to live without it .
, it is even now at my elbow , persuading me not to kill the duke .
take the devil in thy mind , and relieve him not he would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh .
tut , i am , he can not prevail with me , i warrant thee .
spoke like a tail fellow that respects his reputation .
come , shall we to this gear ?
take him over the costard with the hilts of thy sword , and then we will chop him in the in the next room .
o excellent devise !
make a sop of him .
hark !
he stirs shall i strike ?
no , first let reason with him .
where art thou , keeper ?
give me a cup of wine .
you shall have wine enough , my lord , anon .
in god name , what art thou ?
a man , as you are .
but not , as i am , royal .
nor you , as we are , loyal .
thy voice is thunder , but thy looks are humble .
my voice is now the king , my looks mine own .
how darkly and how deadly dost thou speak !
your eyes do menace me why look you pale ?
who sent you hither ?
wherefore do you come ?
to , to , to to murder me ?
ay , ay .
you scarcely have the hearts to tell me so , and therefore can not have the hearts to do it .
wherein , my friends , have i offended you ?
offended us you have not , but the king .
i shall be reconciled to him again .
never , my lord , therefore prepare to die .
are you call forth from out a world of men to slay the innocent ?
what is my offence ?
where are the evidence that do accuse me ?
what lawful quest have given their verdict up unto the frowning judge ?
or who pronounced the bitter sentence of poor clarence ' death ?
before i be convict by course of law , to threaten me with death is most unlawful .
i charge you , as you hope to have redemption by christ dear blood shed for our grievous sins , that you depart and lay no hands on me the deed you undertake is damnable .
what we will do , we do upon command .
and he that hath commanded is the king .
erroneous vassal !
the great king of kings hath in the tables of his law commanded that thou shalt do no murder and wilt thou , then , spurn at his edict and fulfil a man ?
take heed , for he holds vengeance in his hands , to hurl upon their heads that break his law .
and that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee , for false forswearing and for murder too thou didst receive the holy sacrament , to fight in quarrel of the house of lancaster .
and , like a traitor to the name of god , didst break that vow , and with thy treacherous blade the bowels of thy sovereign son .
whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend .
how canst thou urge god dreadful law to us , when thou hast broke it in so dear degree ?
alas !
for whose sake did i that ill deed ?
for edward , for my brother , for his sake why , sirs , he sends ye not to murder me for this for in this sin he is as deep as i .
if god will be revenged for this deed .
o , know you yet , he doth it publicly , take not the quarrel from his powerful arm , he needs no indirect nor lawless course to cut off those that have offended him .
who made thee , then , a bloody minister , when brave plantagenet , that princely novice , was struck dead by thee ?
my brother love , the devil , and my rage .
thy brother love , our duty , and thy fault , provoke us hither now to slaughter thee .
oh , if you love my brother , hate not me , i am his brother , and i love him well .
if you be hired for meed , go back again , and i will send you to my brother gloucester , who shall reward you better for my life than edward will for tidings of my death .
you are deceived , your brother gloucester hates you .
o , no , he loves me , and he holds me dear go you to him from me .
ay , so we will .
tell him , when that our princely father york bless his three sons with his victorious arm , and charged us from his soul to love each other , he little thought of this divided friendship bid gloucester think of this , and he will weep .
ay , millstones , as be lesson us to weep .
o , do not slander him , for he is kind .
right , as snow in harvest .
thou deceivest thyself is he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee .
it can not be , for when i parted with him , he hugg me in his arms , and swore , with sobs , that he would labour my delivery .
why , so he doth , now he delivers thee from this world thraldom to the joys of heaven .
make peace with god , for you must die , my lord .
hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul , to counsel me to make my peace with god , and art thou yet to thy own soul so blind , that thou wilt war with god by murdering me ?
ah , sirs , consider , he that set you on to do this deed will hate you for the deed .
what shall we do ?
relent , and save your souls .
relent !
is cowardly and womanish .
not to relent is beastly , savage , devilish .
which of you , if you were a prince son , being pent from liberty , as i am now , if two such murderers as yourselves came to you , would not entreat for life ?
my friend , i spy some pity in thy looks o , if thine eye be not a flatterer , come thou on my side , and entreat for me , as you would beg , were you in my distress a begging prince what beggar pities not ?
look behind you , my lord .
take that , and that if all this will not do , stabs him i drown you in the within .
exit , with the body a bloody deed , and desperately dispatch !
how fain , like pilate , would i wash my hands of this most grievous guilty murder done !
first murderer how now !
what thou , that thou me not ?
by heavens , the duke shall know how slack thou art !
i would he knew that i had saved his brother !
take thou the fee , and tell him what i say , for i repent me that the duke is slain .
exit so do not i go , coward as thou art .
now must i hide his body in some hole , until the duke take order for his burial and when i have my meed , i must away , for this will out , and here i must not stay .
act ii scene london .
the palace .
flourish .
enter king edward iv sick , queen elizabeth , dorset , rivers , hastings , buckingham , grey , and others why , so now have i done a good day work you peers , continue this united league i every day expect an embassage from my redeemer to redeem me hence , and now in peace my soul shall part to heaven , since i have set my friends at peace on earth .
rivers and hastings , take each other hand , dissemble not your hatred , swear your love .
by heaven , my heart is purged from grudging hate and with my hand i seal my true heart love .
so thrive i , as i truly swear the like !
take heed you dally not before your king , lest he that is the supreme king of kings confound your hidden falsehood , and award either of you to be the other end .
so prosper i , as i swear perfect love !
and i , as i love hastings with my heart !
madam , yourself are not exempt in this , nor your son dorset , buckingham , nor you , you have been factious one against the other , wife , love lord hastings , let him kiss your hand , and what you do , do it unfeignedly .
here , hastings , i will never more remember our former hatred , so thrive i and mine !
dorset , embrace him , hastings , love lord marquess .
this interchange of love , i here protest , upon my part shall be unviolable .
and so swear i , my lord they embrace now , princely buckingham , seal thou this league with thy embracements to my wife allies , and make me happy in your unity .
whenever buckingham doth turn his hate on you or yours , to the queen but with all duteous love doth cherish you and yours , god punish me with hate in those where i expect most love !
when i have most need to employ a friend , and most assured that he is a friend deep , hollow , treacherous , and full of guile , be he unto me !
this do i beg of god , when i am cold in zeal to yours .
a pleasing cordial , princely buckingham , is this thy vow unto my sickly heart .
there wanteth now our brother gloucester here , to make the perfect period of this peace .
and , in good time , here comes the noble duke .
enter gloucester good morrow to my sovereign king and queen and , princely peers , a happy time of day !
happy , indeed , as we have spent the day .
brother , we done deeds of charity , made peace enmity , fair love of hate , between these swelling peers .
a blessed labour , my most sovereign liege amongst this princely heap , if any here , by false intelligence , or wrong surmise , hold me a foe , if i unwittingly , or in my rage , have aught committed that is hardly borne by any in this presence , i desire to reconcile me to his friendly peace is death to me to be at enmity , i hate it , and desire all good men love .
first , madam , i entreat true peace of you , which i will purchase with my duteous service , of you , my noble cousin buckingham , if ever any grudge were lodged between us , of you , lord rivers , and , lord grey , of you , that without desert have frown on me , dukes , earls , lords , gentlemen , indeed , of all .
i do not know that englishman alive with whom my soul is any jot at odds more than the infant that is born i thank my god for my humility .
a holy day shall this be kept hereafter i would to god all strifes were well compounded .
my sovereign liege , i do beseech your majesty to take our brother clarence to your grace .
why , madam , have i offer love for this to be so bouted in this royal presence ?
who knows not that the noble duke is dead ?
they all start you do him injury to scorn his corse .
who knows not he is dead !
who knows he is ?
all seeing heaven , what a world is this !
look i so pale , lord dorset , as the rest ?
ay , my good lord , and no one in this presence but his red colour hath forsook his cheeks .
is clarence dead ?
the order was reversed .
but he , poor soul , by your first order died , and that a winged mercury did bear some tardy cripple bore the countermand , that came too lag to see him buried .
god grant that some , less noble and less loyal , nearer in bloody thoughts , but not in blood , deserve not worse than wretched clarence did , and yet go current from suspicion !
enter derby a boon , my sovereign , for my service done !
i pray thee , peace my soul is full of sorrow .
i will not rise , unless your highness grant .
then speak at once what is it thou .
the forfeit , sovereign , of my servant life , who slew a righteous gentleman lately attendant on the duke of norfolk .
have a tongue to doom my brother death , and shall the same give pardon to a slave ?
my brother slew no man , his fault was thought , and yet his punishment was cruel death .
who sued to me for him ?
who , in my rage , kneel at my feet , and bade me be advised who spake of brotherhood ?
who spake of love ?
who told me how the poor soul did forsake the mighty warwick , and did fight for me ?
who told me , in the field by tewksbury when oxford had me down , he rescued me , and said , brother , live , and be a king ' ?
who told me , when we both lay in the field frozen almost to death , how he did lap me even in his own garments , and gave himself , all thin and naked , to the numb cold night ?
all this from my remembrance brutish wrath sinfully pluck , and not a man of you had so much grace to put it in my mind .
but when your carters or your have done a drunken slaughter , and defaced the precious image of our dear redeemer , you straight are on your knees for pardon , pardon , and i unjustly too , must grant it you but for my brother not a man would speak , nor i , ungracious , speak unto myself for him , poor soul .
the proudest of you all have been beholding to him in his life , yet none of you would once plead for his life .
o god , i fear thy justice will take hold on me , and you , and mine , and yours for this !
come , hastings , help me to my closet .
oh , poor clarence !
exeunt some with king edward iv and queen margaret this is the fruit of rashness !
mark you not how that the guilty kindred of the queen look pale when they did hear of clarence ' death ?
o , they did urge it still unto the king !
god will revenge it .
but come , let us in , to comfort edward with our company .
we wait upon your grace .
exeunt scene ii .
the palace .
enter the duchess of york , with the two children of clarence tell me , good grandam , is our father dead ?
no , boy .
why do you wring your hands , and beat your breast , and cry ' o clarence , my unhappy son ! '
why do you look on us , and shake your head , and call us wretches , orphans , castaways if that our noble father be alive ?
my pretty cousins , you mistake me much , i do lament the sickness of the king .
as loath to lose him , not your father death , it were lost sorrow to wail one that lost .
then , grandam , you conclude that he is dead .
the king my uncle is to blame for this god will revenge it , whom i will importune with daily prayers all to that effect .
and so will i .
peace , children , peace !
the king doth love you well incapable and shallow innocents , you can not guess who caused your father death .
grandam , we can , for my good uncle gloucester told me , the king , provoked by the queen , devised impeachments to imprison him and when my uncle told me so , he wept , and hugg me in his arm , and kindly kiss my cheek , bade me rely on him as on my father , and he would love me dearly as his child .
oh , that deceit should steal such gentle shapes , and with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile !
he is my son , yea , and therein my shame , yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit .
think you my uncle did dissemble , grandam ?
ay , boy .
i can not think it .
hark !
what noise is this ?
enter queen elizabeth , with her hair about her ears , rivers , and dorset after her oh , who shall hinder me to wail and weep , to chide my fortune , and torment myself ?
i join with black despair against my soul , and to myself become an enemy .
what means this scene of rude impatience ?
to make an act of tragic violence edward , my lord , your son , our king , is dead .
why grow the branches now the root is wither ?
why wither not the leaves the sap being gone ?
if you will live , lament , if die , be brief , that our souls may catch the king , or , like obedient subjects , follow him to his new kingdom of perpetual rest .
ah , so much interest have i in thy sorrow as i had title in thy noble husband !
i have bewept a worthy husband death , and lived by looking on his images but now two mirrors of his princely semblance are crack in pieces by malignant death , and i for comfort have but one false glass , which grieves me when i see my shame in him .
thou art a widow , yet thou art a mother , and hast the comfort of thy children left thee but death hath snatch my husband from mine arms , and pluck two crutches from my feeble limbs , edward and clarence .
o , what cause have i , thine being but a moiety of my grief , to overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries !
good aunt , you wept not for our father death , how can we aid you with our kindred tears ?
our fatherless distress was left unmoan , your likewise be unwept !
give me no help in lamentation , i am not barren to bring forth complaints all springs reduce their currents to mine eyes , that i , being govern by the watery moon , may send forth plenteous tears to drown the world !
oh for my husband , for my dear lord edward !
oh for our father , for our dear lord clarence !
alas for both , both mine , edward and clarence !
what stay had i but edward ?
and he gone .
what stay had we but clarence ?
and he gone .
what stays had i but they ?
and they are gone .
was never widow had so dear a loss !
were never orphans had so dear a loss !
was never mother had so dear a loss !
alas , i am the mother of these moans !
their woes are parcell , mine are general .
she for an edward weeps , and so do i , i for a clarence weep , so doth not she these babes for clarence weep and so do i , i for an edward weep , so do not they alas , you three , on me , threefold distress , pour all your tears !
i am your sorrow nurse , and i will pamper it with lamentations .
comfort , dear mother god is much displeased that you take with unthankfulness , his doing in common worldly things , is call ungrateful , with dull unwilligness to repay a debt which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent , much more to be thus opposite with heaven , for it requires the royal debt it lent you .
madam , bethink you , like a careful mother , of the young prince your son send straight for him let him be crown , in him your comfort lives drown desperate sorrow in dead edward grave , and plant your joys in living edward throne .
enter gloucester , buckingham , derby , hastings , and ratcliff madam , have comfort all of us have cause to wail the dimming of our shining star , but none can cure their harms by wailing them .
madam , my mother , i do cry you mercy , i did not see your grace humbly on my knee i crave your blessing .
god bless thee , and put meekness in thy mind , love , charity , obedience , and true duty !
aside amen , and make me die a good old man !
that is the of a mother blessing i marvel why her grace did leave it out .
you cloudy princes and peers , that bear this mutual heavy load of moan , now cheer each other in each other love though we have spent our harvest of this king , we are to reap the harvest of his son .
the broken rancour of your hearts , but lately splinter , knit , and join together , must gently be preserved , cherish , and kept me seemeth good , that , with some little train , forthwith from ludlow the young prince be fetch hither to london , to be crown our king .
why with some little train , my lord of buckingham ?
marry , my lord , lest , by a multitude , the wound of malice should break out , which would be so much the more dangerous by how much the estate is green and yet ungovern where every horse bears his commanding rein , and may direct his course as please himself , as well the fear of harm , as harm apparent , in my opinion , ought to be prevented .
i hope the king made peace with all of us and the compact is firm and true in me .
and so in me , and so , i think , in all yet , since it is but green , it should be put to no apparent likelihood of breach , which haply by much company might be urged therefore i say with noble buckingham , that it is meet so few should fetch the prince .
and so say i .
then be it so , and go we to determine who they shall be that straight shall post to ludlow .
madam , and you , my mother , will you go to give your censures in this weighty business ?
with all our harts .
exeunt all but buckingham and gloucester my lord , whoever journeys to the prince , for god sake , let not us two be behind , for , by the way , i sort occasion , as index to the story we late talk of , to part the queen proud kindred from the king .
my other self , my counsel consistory , my oracle , my prophet !
my dear cousin , i , like a child , will go by thy direction .
towards ludlow then , for we not stay behind .
exeunt scene iii .
london .
a street .
enter two citizens meeting neighbour , well met whither away so fast ?
i promise you , i scarcely know myself hear you the news abroad ?
ay , that the king is dead .
bad news , by ' r lady , seldom comes the better i fear , i fear prove a troublous world .
enter another citizen neighbours , god speed !
give you good morrow , sir .
doth this news hold of good king edward death ?
ay , sir , it is too true , god help the while !
then , masters , look to see a troublous world .
no , no , by god good grace his son shall reign .
woe to the land that govern by a child !
in him there is a hope of government , that in his nonage council under him , and in his full and ripen years himself , no doubt , shall then and till then govern well .
so stood the state when henry the sixth was crown in paris but at nine months old .
stood the state so ?
no , no , good friends , god wot , for then this land was famously enrich with politic grave counsel , then the king had virtuous uncles to protect his grace .
why , so hath this , both by the father and mother .
better it were they all came by the father , or by the father there were none at all , for emulation now , who shall be nearest , will touch us all too near , if god prevent not .
o , full of danger is the duke of gloucester !
and the queen sons and brothers haught and proud and were they to be ruled , and not to rule , this sickly land might solace as before .
come , come , we fear the worst , all shall be well .
when clouds appear , wise men put on their cloaks , when great leaves fall , the winter is at hand , when the sun sets , who doth not look for night ?
untimely storms make men expect a dearth .
all may be well , but , if god sort it so , is more than we deserve , or i expect .
truly , the souls of men are full of dread ye can not reason almost with a man that looks not heavily and full of fear .
before the times of change , still is it so by a divine instinct men minds mistrust ensuing dangers , as by proof , we see the waters swell before a boisterous storm .
but leave it all to god .
whither away ?
marry , we were sent for to the justices .
and so was i i bear you company .
exeunt scene iv .

enter the archbishop of york , young york , queen elizabeth , and the duchess of york last night , i hear , they lay at northampton , at will they be , or next day , they will be here .
i long with all my heart to see the prince i hope he is much grown since last i saw him .
but i hear , no , they say my son of york hath almost him in his growth .
ay , mother , but i would not have it so .
why , my young cousin , it is good to grow .
grandam , one night , as we did sit at supper , my uncle rivers talk how i did grow more than my brother , ' quoth my uncle gloucester , herbs have grace , great weeds do grow apace ' and since , methinks , i would not grow so fast , because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste .
good faith , good faith , the saying did not hold in him that did object the same to thee , he was the thing when he was young , so long and so leisurely , that , if this rule were true , he should be gracious .
why , madam , so , no doubt , he is .
i hope he is , but yet let mothers doubt .
now , by my troth , if i had been remember , i could have given my uncle grace a flout , to touch his growth nearer than he touch mine .
how , my pretty york ?
i pray thee , let me hear it .
marry , they say my uncle grew so fast that he could gnaw a crust at two hours old was full two years ere i could get a tooth .
grandam , this would have been a biting jest .
i pray thee , pretty york , who told thee this ?
grandam , his nurse .
his nurse !
why , she was dead ere thou wert born .
if not she , i can not tell who told me .
a parlous boy go to , you are too shrewd .
good madam , be not angry with the child .
pitchers have ears .
enter a messenger here comes a messenger .
what news ?
such news , my lord , as grieves me to unfold .
how fares the prince ?
well , madam , and in health .
what is thy news then ?
lord rivers and lord grey are sent to pomfret , with them sir thomas vaughan , prisoners .
who hath committed them ?
the mighty dukes gloucester and buckingham .
for what offence ?
the sum of all i can , i have disclosed , why or for what these nobles were committed is all unknown to me , my gracious lady .
ay me , i see the downfall of our house !
the tiger now hath seized the gentle hind , insulting tyranny begins to jet upon the innocent and aweless throne welcome , destruction , death , and massacre !
i see , as in a map , the end of all .
accursed and unquiet wrangling days , how many of you have mine eyes beheld !
my husband lost his life to get the crown , and often up and down my sons were toss , for me to joy and weep their gain and loss and being seated , and domestic broils clean , themselves , the conquerors .
make war upon themselves , blood against blood , self against self o , preposterous and frantic outrage , end thy damned spleen , or let me die , to look on death no more !
come , come , my boy , we will to sanctuary .
madam , farewell .
i go along with you .
you have no cause .
my gracious lady , go , and thither bear your treasure and your goods .
for my part , i resign unto your grace the seal i keep and so betide to me as well i tender you and all of yours !
come , i conduct you to the sanctuary .
exeunt act iii scene london .
a street .
the trumpets sound .
enter the young prince edward , gloucester , buckingham , cardinal , catesby , and others welcome , sweet prince , to london , to your chamber .
welcome , dear cousin , my thoughts ' sovereign the weary way hath made you melancholy .
no , uncle , but our crosses on the way have made it tedious , wearisome , and heavy i want more uncles here to welcome me .
sweet prince , the untainted virtue of your years hath not yet dived into the world deceit nor more can you distinguish of a man than of his outward show , which , god he knows , seldom or never jumpeth with the heart .
those uncles which you want were dangerous , your grace attended to their sugar words , but look not on the poison of their hearts god keep you from them , and from such false friends !
god keep me from false friends !
but they were none .
my lord , the mayor of london comes to greet you .
enter the lord mayor and his train god bless your grace with health and happy days !
i thank you , good my lord , and thank you all .
i thought my mother , and my brother york , would long ere this have met us on the way fie , what a slug is hastings , that he comes not to tell us whether they will come or no !
enter hastings and , in good time , here comes the sweating lord .
welcome , my lord what , will our mother come ?
on what occasion , god he knows , not i , the queen your mother , and your brother york , have taken sanctuary the tender prince would fain have come with me to meet your grace , but by his mother was perforce withheld .
fie , what an indirect and peevish course is this of hers !
lord cardinal , will your grace persuade the queen to send the duke of york unto his princely brother presently ?
if she deny , lord hastings , go with him , and from her jealous arms pluck him perforce .
my lord of buckingham , if my weak oratory can from his mother win the duke of york , anon expect him here , but if she be obdurate to mild entreaties , god in heaven forbid we should infringe the holy privilege of blessed sanctuary !
not for all this land would i be guilty of so deep a sin .
you are too senseless obstinate , my lord , too ceremonious and traditional weigh it but with the grossness of this age , you break not sanctuary in seizing him .
the benefit thereof is always granted to those whose dealings have deserved the place , and those who have the wit to claim the place this prince hath neither claim it nor deserved it , and therefore , in mine opinion , can not have it then , taking him from thence that is not there , you break no privilege nor charter there .
oft have i heard of sanctuary men , but sanctuary children till now .
my lord , you shall my mind for once .
come on , lord hastings , will you go with me ?
i go , my lord .
good lords , make all the speedy haste you may .
exeunt cardinal and hastings say , uncle gloucester , if our brother come , where shall we sojourn till our coronation ?
where it seems best unto your royal self .
if i may counsel you , some day or two your highness shall repose you at the tower then where you please , and shall be thought most fit for your best health and recreation .
i do not like the tower , of any place .
did julius caesar build that place , my lord ?
he did , my gracious lord , begin that place , which , since , succeeding ages have .
is it upon record , or else reported successively from age to age , he built it ?
upon record , my gracious lord .
but say , my lord , it were not register , methinks the truth should live from age to age , as retail to all posterity , even to the general day .
aside so wise so young , they say , do never live long .
what say you , uncle ?
i say , without characters , fame lives long .
aside thus , like the formal vice , iniquity , i moralize two meanings in one word .
that julius caesar was a famous man , with what his valour did enrich his wit , his wit set down to make his valour live death makes no conquest of this conqueror , for now he lives in fame , though not in life .
i tell you what , my cousin buckingham , what , my gracious lord ?
an if i live until i be a man , i win our ancient right in france again , or die a soldier , as i lived a king .
aside short summers lightly have a forward spring .
enter young york , hastings , and the cardinal now , in good time , here comes the duke of york .
richard of york !
how fares our loving brother ?
well , my dread lord , so must i call you now .
ay , brother , to our grief , as it is yours too late he died that might have kept that title , which by his death hath lost much majesty .
how fares our cousin , noble lord of york ?
i thank you , gentle uncle .
o , my lord , you said that idle weeds are fast in growth the prince my brother hath outgrown me far .
he hath , my lord .
and therefore is he idle ?
o , my fair cousin , i must not say so .
then is he more beholding to you than i .
he may command me as my sovereign , but you have power in me as in a kinsman .
i pray you , uncle , give me this dagger .
my dagger , little cousin ?
with all my heart .
a beggar , brother ?
of my kind uncle , that i know will give , and being but a toy , which is no grief to give .
a greater gift than that i give my cousin .
a greater gift !
o , that the sword to it .
a gentle cousin , were it light enough .
o , then , i see , you will part but with light gifts , in weightier things you say a beggar nay .
it is too heavy for your grace to wear .
i weigh it lightly , were it heavier .
what , would you have my weapon , little lord ?
i would , that i might thank you as you call me .
how ?
little .
my lord of york will still be cross in talk uncle , your grace knows how to bear with him .
you mean , to bear me , not to bear with me uncle , my brother mocks both you and me , because that i am little , like an ape , he thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders .
with what a wit he reasons !
to mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle , he prettily and aptly taunts himself so cunning and so young is wonderful .
my lord , please you pass along ?
myself and my good cousin buckingham will to your mother , to entreat of her to meet you at the tower and welcome you .
what , will you go unto the tower , my lord ?
my lord protector needs will have it so .
i shall not sleep in quiet at the tower .
why , what should you fear ?
marry , my uncle clarence ' angry ghost my grandam told me he was murdered there .
i fear no uncles dead .
nor none that live , i hope .
an if they live , i hope i need not fear .
but come , my lord , and with a heavy heart , thinking on them , go i unto the tower .
a sennet .
exeunt all but gloucester , buckingham and catesby think you , my lord , this little prating york was not incensed by his subtle mother to taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously ?
no doubt , no doubt , o , is a parlous boy , bold , quick , ingenious , forward , capable he is all the mother , from the top to toe .
well , let them rest .
come hither , catesby .
thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend as closely to conceal what we impart thou our reasons urged upon the way , what thou ?
is it not an easy matter to make william lord hastings of our mind , for the instalment of this noble duke in the seat royal of this famous isle ?
he for his father sake so loves the prince , that he will not be won to aught against him .
what thou , then , of stanley ?
what will he ?
he will do all in all as hastings doth .
well , then , no more but this go , gentle catesby , and , as it were far off sound thou lord hastings , how doth he stand affected to our purpose , and summon him to the tower , to sit about the coronation .
if thou dost find him tractable to us , encourage him , and show him all our reasons if he be leaden , , unwilling , be thou so too , and so break off your talk , and give us notice of his inclination for we hold divided councils , wherein thyself shalt highly be employ .
commend me to lord william tell him , catesby , his ancient knot of dangerous adversaries are let blood at , and bid my friend , for joy of this good news , give mistress shore one gentle kiss the more .
good catesby , go , effect this business soundly .
my good lords both , with all the heed i may .
shall we hear from you , catesby , ere we sleep ?
you shall , my lord .
at crosby place , there shall you find us both .
exit catesby now , my lord , what shall we do , if we perceive lord hastings will not yield to our complots ?
chop off his head , man , somewhat we will do and , look , when i am king , claim thou of me the earldom of hereford , and the moveables whereof the king my brother stood possess .
i claim that promise at your grace hands .
and look to have it yielded with all willingness .
come , let us sup betimes , that afterwards we may digest our complots in some form .
exeunt scene ii .
before lord hastings ' house .
enter a messenger what , ho !
my lord !
within who knocks at the door ?
a messenger from the lord stanley .
enter hastings what ?
upon the stroke of four .
can not thy master sleep these tedious nights ?
so it should seem by that i have to say .
first , he commends him to your noble lordship .
and then ?
and then he sends you word he dreamt the boar had razed his helm besides , he says there are two councils held , and that may be determined at the one which may make you and him to rue at the other .
therefore he sends to know your lordship pleasure , if presently you will take horse with him , and with all speed post with him toward the north , to shun the danger that his soul divines .
go , fellow , go , return unto thy lord , bid him not fear the separated councils his honour and myself are at the one , and at the other is my servant catesby where nothing can proceed that toucheth us whereof i shall not have intelligence .
tell him his fears are shallow , wanting instance and for his dreams , i wonder he is so fond to trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers to fly the boar before the boar pursues , were to incense the boar to follow us and make pursuit where he did mean no chase .
go , bid thy master rise and come to me and we will both together to the tower , where , he shall see , the boar will use us kindly .
my gracious lord , i tell him what you say .
exit enter catesby many good morrows to my noble lord !
good morrow , catesby , you are early stirring what news , what news , in this our tottering state ?
it is a reeling world , indeed , my lord , and i believe twill never stand upright tim richard wear the garland of the realm .
how !
wear the garland !
dost thou mean the crown ?
ay , my good lord .
i have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders ere i will see the crown so foul misplaced .
but canst thou guess that he doth aim at it ?
ay , on my life , and hopes to find forward upon his party for the gain thereof and thereupon he sends you this good news , that this same very day your enemies , the kindred of the queen , must die at pomfret .
indeed , i am no mourner for that news , because they have been still mine enemies but , that i give my voice on richard side , to bar my master heirs in true descent , god knows i will not do it , to the death .
god keep your lordship in that gracious mind !
but i shall laugh at this a hence , that they who brought me in my master hate i live to look upon their tragedy .
i tell thee , catesby what , my lord ?
ere a fortnight make me elder , i send some packing that yet think not on it .
is a vile thing to die , my gracious lord , when men are unprepared and look not for it .
o monstrous , monstrous !
and so falls it out with rivers , vaughan , grey and so do with some men else , who think themselves as safe as thou and i , who , as thou , are dear to princely richard and to buckingham .
the princes both make high account of you , aside for they account his head upon the bridge .
i know they do , and i have well deserved it .
enter stanley come on , come on , where is your , man ?
fear you the boar , and go so unprovided ?
my lord , good morrow , good morrow , catesby you may jest on , but , by the holy rood , i do not like these several councils , i .
my lord , i hold my life as dear as you do yours , and never in my life , i do protest , was it more precious to me than is now think you , but that i know our state secure , i would be so triumphant as i am ?
the lords at pomfret , when they rode from london , were jocund , and supposed their state was sure , and they indeed had no cause to mistrust , but yet , you see how soon the day .
this sudden stag of rancour i misdoubt pray god , i say , i prove a needless coward !
what , shall we toward the tower ?
the day is spent .
come , come , have with you .
wot you what , my lord ?
the lords you talk of are beheaded .
they , for their truth , might better wear their heads than some that have accused them wear their hats .
but come , my lord , let us away .
enter a pursuivant go on before , i talk with this good fellow .
exeunt stanley and catesby how now , sirrah !
how goes the world with thee ?
the better that your lordship please to ask .
i tell thee , man , is better with me now than when i met thee last where now we meet then was i going prisoner to the tower , by the suggestion of the queen allies , but now , i tell thee keep it to thyself this day those enemies are put to death , and i in better state than i was .
god hold it , to your honour good content !
gramercy , fellow there , drink that for me .
throws him his purse god save your lordship !
exit enter a priest well met , my lord , i am glad to see your honour .
i thank thee , good sir john , with all my heart .
i am in your debt for your last exercise , come the next sabbath , and i will content you .
he whispers in his ear enter buckingham what , talking with a priest , lord chamberlain ?
your friends at pomfret , they do need the priest , your honour hath no shriving work in hand .
good faith , and when i met this holy man , those men you talk of came into my mind .
what , go you toward the tower ?
i do , my lord , but long i shall not stay i shall return before your lordship thence .
is like enough , for i stay dinner there .
aside and supper too , although thou it not .
come , will you go ?
i wait upon your lordship .
exeunt scene iii .
pomfret castle .
enter ratcliff , with halberds , carrying rivers , grey , and vaughan to death come , bring forth the prisoners .
sir richard ratcliff , let me tell thee this shalt thou behold a subject die for truth , for duty , and for loyalty .
god keep the prince from all the pack of you !
a knot you are of damned !
you live that shall cry woe for this after .
dispatch , the limit of your lives is out .
o pomfret , pomfret !
o thou bloody prison , fatal and ominous to noble peers !
within the guilty closure of thy walls richard the second here was hack to death , and , for more slander to thy dismal seat , we give thee up our guiltless blood to drink .
now margaret curse is upon our heads , for standing by when richard stabb her son .
then cursed she hastings , then cursed she buckingham , then cursed she richard .
o , remember , god to hear her prayers for them , as now for us and for my sister and her princely sons , be satisfied , dear god , with our true blood , which , as thou , unjustly must be spilt .
make haste , the hour of death is expiate .
come , grey , come , vaughan , let us all embrace and take our leave , until we meet in heaven .
exeunt scene iv .
the tower of london .
enter buckingham , derby , hastings , the bishop of ely , ratcliff , lovel , with others , and take their seats at a table my lords , at once the cause why we are met is , to determine of the coronation .
in god name , speak when is the royal day ?
are all things fitting for that royal time ?
it is , and wants but nomination .
, then , i judge a happy day .
who knows the lord protector mind herein ?
who is most inward with the royal duke ?
your grace , we think , should soonest know his mind .
who , i , my lord i we know each other faces , but for our hearts , he knows no more of mine , than i of yours , nor i no more of his , than you of mine .
lord hastings , you and he are near in love .
i thank his grace , i know he loves me well , but , for his purpose in the coronation .
i have not sounded him , nor he deliver his gracious pleasure any way therein but you , my noble lords , may name the time , and in the duke behalf i give my voice , which , i presume , he take in gentle part .
enter gloucester now in good time , here comes the duke himself .
my noble lords and cousins all , good morrow .
i have been long a sleeper , but , i hope , my absence doth neglect no great designs , which by my presence might have been concluded .
had not you come upon your cue , my lord william lord hastings had pronounced your part , i mean , your voice , for crowning of the king .
than my lord hastings no man might be bolder , his lordship knows me well , and loves me well .
i thank your grace .
my lord of ely !
my lord ?
when i was last in holborn , i saw good strawberries in your garden there i do beseech you send for some of them .
marry , and will , my lord , with all my heart .
exit cousin of buckingham , a word with you .
drawing him aside catesby hath sounded hastings in our business , and finds the testy gentleman so hot , as he will lose his head ere give consent his master son , as worshipful as he terms it , shall lose the royalty of england throne .
withdraw you hence , my lord , i follow you .
exit gloucester , buckingham following we have not yet set down this day of triumph .
, in mine opinion , is too sudden , for i myself am not so well provided as else i would be , were the day prolong .
bishop of ely where is my lord protector ?
i have sent for these strawberries .
his grace looks cheerfully and smooth , there some conceit or other likes him well , when he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit .
i think there never a man in christendom that can less hide his love or hate than he , for by his face straight shall you know his heart .
what of his heart perceive you in his face by any likelihood he show ?
marry , that with no man here he is offended , for , were he , he had shown it in his looks .
i pray god he be not , i say .
gloucester and buckingham i pray you all , tell me what they deserve that do conspire my death with devilish plots of damned witchcraft , and that have prevail upon my body with their hellish charms ?
the tender love i bear your grace , my lord , makes me most forward in this noble presence to doom the offenders , whatsoever they be i say , my lord , they have deserved death .
then be your eyes the witness of this ill see how i am bewitch , behold mine arm is , like a blasted sapling , wither up and this is edward wife , that monstrous witch , consorted with that harlot strumpet shore , that by their witchcraft thus have marked me .
if they have done this thing , my gracious lord if i thou protector of this damned strumpet tellest thou me of ' ?
thou art a traitor off with his head !
now , by saint paul i swear , i will not dine until i see the same .
lovel and ratcliff , look that it be done the rest , that love me , rise and follow me .
exeunt all but hastings , ratcliff , and lovel woe , woe for england !
not a whit for me , for i , too fond , might have prevented this .
stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm , but i disdain it , and did scorn to fly three times my horse did stumble , and startled , when he look upon the tower , as loath to bear me to the .
o , now i want the priest that spake to me i now repent i told the pursuivant as triumphing at mine enemies , how they at pomfret bloodily were butcher , and i myself secure in grace and favour .
o margaret , margaret , now thy heavy curse is lighted on poor hastings ' wretched head !
dispatch , my lord , the duke would be at dinner make a short shrift , he longs to see your head .
o momentary grace of mortal men , which we more hunt for than the grace of god !
who builds his hopes in air of your good looks , lives like a drunken sailor on a mast , ready , with every nod , to tumble down into the fatal bowels of the deep .
come , come , dispatch , is bootless to exclaim .
o bloody richard !
miserable england !
i prophesy the time to thee that ever wretched age hath look upon .
come , lead me to the block , bear him my head .
they smile at me that shortly shall be dead .
exeunt scene the .
enter gloucester and buckingham , in rotten armour , marvellous come , cousin , canst thou quake , and change thy colour , murder thy breath in the middle of a word , and then begin again , and stop again , as if thou wert distraught and mad with terror ?
tut , i can counterfeit the deep tragedian , speak and look back , and pry on every side , tremble and start at wagging of a straw , intending deep suspicion ghastly looks are at my service , like enforced smiles , and both are ready in their offices , at any time , to grace my stratagems .
but what , is catesby gone ?
he is , and , see , he brings the mayor along .
enter the lord mayor and catesby lord mayor , look to the drawbridge there !
hark !
a drum .
catesby , the walls .
lord mayor , the reason we have sent look back , defend thee , here are enemies .
god and our innocency defend and guard us !
be patient , they are friends , ratcliff and lovel .
enter lovel and ratcliff , with hastings ' head here is the head of that ignoble traitor , the dangerous and unsuspected hastings .
so dear i loved the man , that i must weep .
i took him for the plainest harmless creature that breathed upon this earth a christian , made him my book wherein my soul recorded the history of all her secret thoughts so smooth he daub his vice with show of virtue , that , his apparent open guilt omitted , i mean , his conversation with shore wife , he lived from all attainder of suspect .
well , well , he was the shelter traitor that ever lived .
would you imagine , or almost believe , not that , by great preservation , we live to tell it you , the subtle traitor this day had plotted , in the to murder me and my good lord of gloucester ?
what , had he so ?
what , think you we are turks or infidels ?
or that we would , against the form of law , proceed thus rashly to the villain death , but that the extreme peril of the case , the peace of england and our persons ' safety , enforced us to this execution ?
now , fair befall you !
he deserved his death , and you my good lords , both have well proceeded , to warn false traitors from the like attempts .
i never look for better at his hands , after he once fell in with mistress shore .
yet had not we determined he should die , until your lordship came to see his death , which now the loving haste of these our friends , somewhat against our meaning , have prevented because , my lord , we would have had you heard the traitor speak , and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treason , that you might well have signified the same unto the citizens , who haply may misconstrue us in him and wail his death .
but , my good lord , your grace word shall serve , as well as i had seen and heard him speak and doubt you not , right noble princes both , but i acquaint our duteous citizens with all your just proceedings in this cause .
and to that end we wish your here , to avoid the carping censures of the world .
but since you come too late of our intents , yet witness what you hear we did intend and so , my good lord mayor , we bid farewell .
exit lord mayor go , after , after , cousin buckingham .
the mayor towards guildhall hies him in all post there , at your advantage of the time , infer the bastardy of edward children tell them how edward put to death a citizen , only for saying he would make his son heir to the crown , meaning indeed his house , which , by the sign thereof was termed so .
moreover , urge his hateful luxury and bestial appetite in change of lust , which stretched to their servants , daughters , wives , even where his lustful eye or savage heart , without control , listed to make his prey .
nay , for a need , thus far come near my person tell them , when that my mother went with child of that unsatiate edward , noble york my princely father then had wars in france and , by just computation of the time , found that the issue was not his begot , which well appeared in his lineaments , being nothing like the noble duke my father but touch this sparingly , as far off , because you know , my lord , my mother lives .
fear not , my lord , i play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so , my lord , adieu .
if you thrive well , bring them to baynard castle , where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and bishops .
i go and towards three or four look for the news that the guildhall affords .
exit buckingham go , lovel , with all speed to doctor shaw , to catesby go thou to friar penker , bid them both meet me within this hour at baynard castle .
exeunt all but gloucester now will i in , to take some privy order , to draw the brats of clarence out of sight , and to give notice , that no manner of person at any time have recourse unto the princes .
exit scene vi .
the same .
enter a scrivener , with a paper in his hand this is the indictment of the good lord hastings , which in a set hand fairly is engross , that it may be this day read over in paul .
and mark how well the sequel hangs together eleven hours i spent to write it over , for yesternight by catesby was it brought me , the precedent was full as long and yet within these five hours lived lord hastings , untainted , unexamined , free , at liberty here a good world the while !
why who so gross , that seeth not this palpable device ?
yet who so blind , but says he sees it not ?
bad is the world , and all will come to nought , when such bad dealings must be seen in thought .
exit scene vii .
baynard castle .
enter gloucester and buckingham , at several doors how now , my lord , what say the citizens ?
now , by the holy mother of our lord , the citizens are mum and speak not a word .
touch you the bastardy of edward children ?
i did , with his contract with lady lucy , and his contract by deputy in france , the insatiate greediness of his desires , and his enforcement of the city wives , his tyranny for trifles , his own bastardy , as being got , your father then in france , his resemblance , being not like the duke , withal i did infer your lineaments , being the right idea of your father , both in your form and nobleness of mind , laid open all your victories in scotland , your dicipline in war , wisdom in peace , your bounty , virtue , fair humility indeed , left nothing fitting for the purpose untouch , or slightly handled , in discourse and when mine oratory grew to an end i bid them that did love their country good cry save richard , england royal king ! '
ah !
and did they so ?
no , so god help me , they spake not a word , but , like dumb statues or breathing stones , gazed each on other , and look deadly pale .
which when i saw , i reprehended them , and ask the mayor what meant this wilful silence his answer was , the people were not wont to be spoke to but by the recorder .
then he was urged to tell my tale again , saith the duke , thus hath the duke inferr , ' but nothing spake in warrant from himself .
when he had done , some followers of mine own , at the lower end of the hall , hurl up their caps , and some ten voices cried save king richard ! '
and thus i took the vantage of those few , , gentle citizens and friends , ' quoth i , general applause and loving shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard ' and even here brake off , and came away .
what tongueless blocks were they !
would not they speak ?
no , by my troth , my lord .
will not the mayor then and his brethren come ?
the mayor is here at hand intend some fear , be not you spoke with , but by mighty suit and look you get a in your hand , and stand betwixt two churchmen , good my lord , for on that ground i build a holy descant and be not easily won to our request play the maid part , still answer nay , and take it .
i go , and if you plead as well for them as i can say nay to thee for myself , no doubt well bring it to a happy issue .
go , go , up to the leads , the lord mayor knocks .
exit gloucester enter the lord mayor and citizens welcome my lord , i dance attendance here , i think the duke will not be spoke withal .
enter catesby here comes his servant how now , catesby , what says he ?
my lord he doth entreat your grace , to visit him or next day he is within , with two right reverend fathers , divinely bent to meditation , and no worldly suit would he be moved , to draw him from his holy exercise .
return , good catesby , to thy lord again , tell him , myself , the mayor and citizens , in deep designs and matters of great moment , no less importing than our general good , are come to have some conference with his grace .
i tell him what you say , my lord .
exit ah , ha , my lord , this prince is not an edward !
he is not lolling on a lewd , but on his knees at meditation , not dallying with a brace of courtezans , but meditating with two deep divines , not sleeping , to engross his idle body , but praying , to enrich his watchful soul happy were england , would this gracious prince take on himself the sovereignty thereof but , sure , i fear , we shall win him to it .
marry , god forbid his grace should say us nay !
i fear he will .
catesby how now , catesby , what says your lord ?
my lord , he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to speak with him , his grace not being warn thereof before my lord , he fears you mean no good to him .
sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me , that i mean no good to him by heaven , i come in perfect love to him , and so once more return and tell his grace .
exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads , is hard to draw them thence , so sweet is zealous contemplation .
enter gloucester aloft , between two bishops .
catesby returns see , where he stands between two clergymen !
two props of virtue for a christian prince , to stay him from the fall of vanity and , see , a book of prayer in his hand , true ornaments to know a holy man .
famous plantagenet , most gracious prince , lend favourable ears to our request , and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal .
my lord , there needs no such apology i rather do beseech you pardon me , who , earnest in the service of my god , neglect the visitation of my friends .
but , leaving this , what is your grace pleasure ?
even that , i hope , which pleaseth god above , and all good men of this ungovern isle .
i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the city eyes , and that you come to reprehend my ignorance .
you have , my lord would it might please your grace , at our entreaties , to amend that fault !
else wherefore breathe i in a christian land ?
then know , it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat , the throne majestical , the scepter office of your ancestors , your state of fortune and your due of birth , the lineal glory of your royal house , to the corruption of a blemished stock whilst , in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts , which here we waken to our country good , this noble isle doth want her proper limbs , her face defaced with scars of infamy , her royal stock graft with ignoble plants , and almost shoulder in the swallowing gulf of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion .
which to recure , we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land , not as protector , steward , substitute , or lowly factor for another gain , but as successively from blood to blood , your right of birth , your empery , your own .
for this , consorted with the citizens , your very worshipful and loving friends , and by their vehement instigation , in this just suit come i to move your grace .
i know not whether to depart in silence , or bitterly to speak in your reproof .
best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer , you might haply think ambition , not replying , yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty , which fondly you would here impose on me , if to reprove you for this suit of yours , so season with your faithful love to me .
then , on the other side , i cheque my friends .
therefore , to speak , and to avoid the first , and then , in speaking , not to incur the last , definitively thus i answer you .
your love deserves my thanks , but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request .
first if all obstacles were cut away , and that my path were even to the crown , as my ripe revenue and due by birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit , so mighty and so many my defects , as i had rather hide me from my greatness , being a bark to brook no mighty sea , than in my greatness covet to be hid , and in the vapour of my glory smother .
but , god be thank , there no need of me , and much i need to help you , if need were , the royal tree hath left us royal fruit , which , mellow by the stealing hours of time , will well become the seat of majesty , and make , no doubt , us happy by his reign .
on him i lay what you would lay on me , the right and fortune of his happy stars , which god defend that i should wring from him !
my lord , this argues conscience in your grace , but the respects thereof are nice and trivial , all circumstances well considered .
you say that edward is your brother son so say we too , but not by edward wife , for first he was contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to that vow and afterward by substitute betroth to bona , sister to the king of france .
these both put by a poor petitioner , a mother of a many children , a and distressed widow , even in the afternoon of her best days , made prize and purchase of his lustful eye , seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts to base declension and loathed bigamy by her , in his unlawful bed , he got this edward , whom our manners term the prince .
more bitterly could i expostulate , save that , for reverence to some alive , i give a sparing limit to my tongue .
then , good my lord , take to your royal self this proffer benefit of dignity , if non to bless us and the land withal , yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times , unto a lineal course .
do , good my lord , your citizens entreat you .
refuse not , mighty lord , this proffer love .
o , make them joyful , grant their lawful suit !
alas , why would you heap these cares on me ?
i am unfit for state and majesty , i do beseech you , take it not amiss , i can not nor i will not yield to you .
if you refuse it , as , in love and zeal , loath to depose the child , your brother son , as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle , kind , effeminate remorse , which we have noted in you to your kin , and egally indeed to all estates , yet whether you accept our suit or no , your brother son shall never reign our king , but we will plant some other in the throne , to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave come , citizens !
i entreat no more .
o , do not swear , my lord of buckingham .
exit buckingham with the citizens call them again , my lord , and accept their suit .
do , good my lord , lest all the land do rue it .
would you enforce me to a world of care ?
well , call them again .
i am not made of stone , but penetrable to your .
kind entreats , albeit against my conscience and my soul .
buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham , and you sage , grave men , since you will buckle fortune on my back , to bear her burthen , whether i will or no , i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or reproach attend the sequel of your imposition , your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof , for god he knows , and you may partly see , how far i am from the desire thereof .
god bless your grace !
we see it , and will say it .
in saying so , you shall but say the truth .
then i salute you with this kingly title long live richard , england royal king !
amen .

daughter , well met .
god give your graces both a happy and a joyful time of day !

kind sister , thanks we enter all together .
enter brakenbury and , in good time , here the lieutenant comes .
master lieutenant , pray you , by your leave , how doth the prince , and my young son of york ?
right well , dear madam .
by your patience , i may not suffer you to visit them , the king hath straitly charged the contrary .
the king !
why , who that ?
i cry you mercy i mean the lord protector .
the lord protect him from that kingly title !
hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me ?
i am their mother , who should keep me from them ?
i am their fathers mother , i will see them .
their aunt i am in law , in love their mother then bring me to their sights , i bear thy blame and take thy office from thee , on my peril .
no , madam , no , i may not leave it so i am bound by oath , and therefore pardon me .
exit enter lord stanley let me but meet you , ladies , one hour hence , and i salute your grace of york as mother , and reverend looker on , of two fair queens .
to lady anne come , madam , you must straight to westminster , there to be crowned richard royal queen .
o , cut my lace in sunder , that my pent heart may have some scope to beat , or else i swoon with this news !
despiteful tidings !
o unpleasing news !
be of good cheer mother , how fares your grace ?
o dorset , speak not to me , get thee hence !
death and destruction dog thee at the heels , thy mother name is ominous to children .
if thou wilt outstrip death , go cross the seas , and live with richmond , from the reach of hell go , hie thee , hie thee from this , lest thou increase the number of the dead , and make me die the thrall of margaret curse , nor mother , wife , nor england counted queen .
full of wise care is this your counsel , madam .
take all the swift advantage of the hours , you shall have letters from me to my son to meet you on the way , and welcome you .
be not tardy by unwise delay .
o wind of misery !
o my accursed womb , the bed of death !
a cockatrice hast thou hatch to the world , whose unavoided eye is murderous .
come , madam , come , i in all haste was sent .
and i in all unwillingness will go .
i would to god that the inclusive verge of golden metal that must round my brow were steel , to sear me to the brain !
anointed let me be with deadly venom , and die , ere men can say , god save the queen !
go , go , poor soul , i envy not thy glory to feed my humour , wish thyself no harm .
no !
why ?
when he that is my husband now came to me , as i follow henry corse , when scarce the blood was well wash from his hands which issued from my other angel husband and that dead saint which then i weeping follow , o , when , i say , i look on richard face , this was my wish thou , ' quoth i , ' accursed , for making me , so young , so old a widow !
and , when thou , let sorrow haunt thy bed , and be thy wife if any be so mad as miserable by the life of thee as thou hast made me by my dear lord death !
lo , ere i can repeat this curse again , even in so short a space , my woman heart grossly grew captive to his honey words and proved the subject of my own soul curse , which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest , for never yet one hour in his bed have i enjoy the golden dew of sleep , but have been waked by his timorous dreams .
besides , he hates me for my father warwick , and will , no doubt , shortly be rid of me .
poor heart , adieu !
i pity thy complaining .
no more than from my soul i mourn for yours .
farewell , thou woful welcomer of glory !
adieu , poor soul , that takest thy leave of it !
to dorset go thou to richmond , and good fortune guide thee !
to lady anne go thou to richard , and good angels guard thee !
to queen elizabeth go thou to sanctuary , and good thoughts possess thee !
i to my grave , where peace and rest lie with me !
eighty odd years of sorrow have i seen , and each hour joy wrecked with a week of teen .
stay , yet look back with me unto the tower .
pity , you ancient stones , those tender babes whom envy hath immured within your walls !
rough cradle for such little pretty ones !
rude ragged nurse , old sullen playfellow for tender princes , use my babies well !
so foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell .

here he ascendeth his throne thus high , by thy advice and thy assistance , is king richard seated , but shall we wear these honours for a day ?
or shall they last , and we rejoice in them ?
still live they and for ever may they last !
o buckingham , now do i play the touch , to try if thou be current gold indeed young edward lives think now what i would say .
say on , my loving lord .
why , buckingham , i say , i would be king , why , so you are , my thrice renowned liege .
ha !
am i king ?
is so but edward lives .
true , noble prince .
o bitter consequence , that edward still should live !
, noble prince ! '
cousin , thou wert not wont to be so dull shall i be plain ?
i wish the bastards dead , and i would have it suddenly perform .
what sayest thou ?
speak suddenly , be brief .
your grace may do your pleasure .
tut , tut , thou art all ice , thy kindness freezeth say , have i thy consent that they shall die ?
give me some breath , some little pause , my lord before i positively herein i will resolve your grace immediately .
exit aside to a stander by the king is angry see , he bites the lip .
i will converse with fools and unrespective boys none are for me that look into me with considerate eyes buckingham grows circumspect .
boy !
my lord ?
thou not any whom corrupting gold would tempt unto a close exploit of death ?
my lord , i know a discontented gentleman , whose humble means match not his haughty mind gold were as good as twenty orators , and will , no doubt , tempt him to any thing .
what is his name ?
his name , my lord , is tyrrel .
i partly know the man go , call him hither .
exit page the witty buckingham no more shall be the neighbour to my counsel hath he so long held out with me untired , and stops he now for breath ?
enter stanley how now !
what news with you ?
my lord , i hear the marquis dorset fled to richmond , in those parts beyond the sea where he abides .
stands apart catesby !
my lord ?
rumour it abroad that anne , my wife , is sick and like to die i will take order for her keeping close .
inquire me out some gentleman , whom i will marry straight to clarence ' daughter the boy is foolish , and i fear not him .
look , how thou !
i say again , give out that anne my wife is sick and like to die about it , for it stands me much upon , to stop all hopes whose growth may damage me .
exit catesby i must be married to my brother daughter , or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass .
murder her brothers , and then marry her !
uncertain way of gain !
but i am in so far in blood that sin will pluck on sin pity dwells not in this eye .
page , with tyrrel is thy name tyrrel ?
james tyrrel , and your most obedient subject .
art thou , indeed ?
prove me , my gracious sovereign .
darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine ?
ay , my lord , but i had rather kill two enemies .
why , there thou hast it two deep enemies , foes to my rest and my sweet sleep disturbers are they that i would have thee deal upon tyrrel , i mean those bastards in the tower .
let me have open means to come to them , and soon i rid you from the fear of them .
thou sweet music .
hark , come hither , tyrrel go , by this token rise , and lend thine ear whispers there is no more but so say it is done , and i will love thee , and prefer thee too .
is done , my gracious lord .
shall we hear from thee , tyrrel , ere we sleep ?
ye shall , my lord .
exit buckingham my lord , i have consider in my mind the late demand that you did sound me in .
well , let that pass .
dorset is fled to richmond .
i hear that news , my lord .
stanley , he is your wife son well , look to it .
my lord , i claim your gift , my due by promise , for which your honour and your faith is pawn , the earldom of hereford and the moveables the which you promised i should possess .
stanley , look to your wife , if she convey letters to richmond , you shall answer it .
what says your highness to my just demand ?
as i remember , henry the sixth did prophesy that richmond should be king , when richmond was a little peevish boy .
a king , perhaps , perhaps , my lord !
how chance the prophet could not at that time have told me , i being by , that i should kill him ?
my lord , your promise for the earldom , richmond !
when last i was at exeter , the mayor in courtesy show me the castle , and call it rougemont at which name i started , because a bard of ireland told me once i should not live long after i saw richmond .
my lord !
ay , what ?
i am thus bold to put your grace in mind of what you promised me .
well , but what ?
upon the stroke of ten .
well , let it strike .
why let it strike ?
because that , like a jack , thou the stroke betwixt thy begging and my meditation .
i am not in the giving vein .
why , then resolve me whether you will or no .
tut , tut , thou troublest me , am not in the vein .
exeunt all but buckingham is it even so ?
rewards he my true service with such deep contempt made i him king for this ?
o , let me think on hastings , and be gone to brecknock , while my fearful head is on !
exit scene iii .
the same .
enter tyrrel the tyrannous and bloody deed is done .
the most arch of piteous massacre that ever yet this land was guilty of .
dighton and forrest , whom i did suborn to do this ruthless piece of butchery , although they were flesh villains , bloody dogs , melting with tenderness and kind compassion wept like two children in their deaths ' sad stories .
, thus ' quoth dighton , those tender babes ' , thus , ' quoth forrest , one another within their innocent alabaster arms their lips were four red roses on a stalk , which in their summer beauty kiss each other .
a book of prayers on their pillow lay , which once , ' quoth forrest , changed my mind , but o !
the devil ' there the villain stopp whilst dighton thus told on smothered the most replenished sweet work of nature , that from the prime creation she framed . '
thus both are gone with conscience and remorse , they could not speak , and so i left them both , to bring this tidings to the bloody king .
and here he comes .
enter king richard iii all hail , my sovereign liege !
kind tyrrel , am i happy in thy news ?
if to have done the thing you gave in charge beget your happiness , be happy then , for it is done , my lord .
but didst thou see them dead ?
i did , my lord .
and buried , gentle tyrrel ?
the chaplain of the tower hath buried them , but how or in what place i do not know .
come to me , tyrrel , soon at after supper , and thou shalt tell the process of their death .
meantime , but think how i may do thee good , and be inheritor of thy desire .
farewell till soon .
exit tyrrel the son of clarence have i pent up close , his daughter meanly have i match in marriage , the sons of edward sleep in abraham bosom , and anne my wife hath bid the world good night .
now , for i know the breton richmond aims at young elizabeth , my brother daughter , and , by that knot , looks proudly the crown , to her i go , a jolly thriving wooer .
enter catesby my lord !
good news or bad , that thou comest in so bluntly ?
bad news , my lord ely is fled to richmond , and buckingham , back with the hardy welshmen , is in the field , and still his power increaseth .
ely with richmond troubles me more near than buckingham and his army .
come , i have heard that fearful commenting is leaden servitor to dull delay , delay leads impotent and beggary then fiery expedition be my wing , jove mercury , and herald for a king !
come , muster men my counsel is my shield , we must be brief when traitors brave the field .
exeunt scene iv .
before the palace .
enter queen margaret so , now prosperity begins to mellow and drop into the rotten mouth of death .
here in these confines slily have i lurk , to watch the waning of mine adversaries .
a dire induction am i witness to , and will to france , hoping the consequence will prove as bitter , black , and tragical .
withdraw thee , wretched margaret who comes here ?
enter queen elizabeth and the duchess of york ah , my young princes !
ah , my tender babes !
my unblown flowers , sweets !
if yet your gentle souls fly in the air and be not fix in doom perpetual , hover about me with your airy wings and hear your mother lamentation !
hover about her , say , that right for right hath dimm your infant morn to aged night .
so many miseries have crazed my voice , that my tongue is mute and dumb , edward plantagenet , why art thou dead ?
plantagenet doth quit plantagenet .
edward for edward pays a dying debt .
wilt thou , o god , fly from such gentle lambs , and throw them in the entrails of the wolf ?
when didst thou sleep when such a deed was done ?
when holy harry died , and my sweet son .
blind sight , dead life , poor mortal living ghost , woe scene , world shame , grave due by life usurp , brief abstract and record of tedious days , rest thy unrest on england lawful earth , sitting down unlawfully made drunk with innocents ' blood !
o , that thou wouldst as well afford a grave as thou canst yield a melancholy seat !
then would i hide my bones , not rest them here .
o , who hath any cause to mourn but i ?
sitting down by her if ancient sorrow be most reverend , give mine the benefit of seniory , and let my woes frown on the upper hand .
if sorrow can admit society , sitting down with them tell your woes again by viewing mine i had an edward , till a richard kill him , i had a harry , till a richard kill him thou hadst an edward , till a richard kill him , thou hadst a richard , till a richard killed him , i had a richard too , and thou didst kill him , i had a rutland too , thou to kill him .
thou hadst a clarence too , and richard kill him .
from forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept a that doth hunt us all to death that dog , that had his teeth before his eyes , to worry lambs and lap their gentle blood , that foul defacer of god handiwork , that excellent grand tyrant of the earth , that reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls , thy womb let loose , to chase us to our graves .
o upright , just , and god , how do i thank thee , that this carnal cur preys on the issue of his mother body , and makes her with others ' moan !
o harry wife , triumph not in my woes !
god witness with me , i have wept for thine .
bear with me , i am hungry for revenge , and now i cloy me with beholding it .
thy edward he is dead , that stabb my edward thy other edward dead , to quit my edward , young york he is but boot , because both they match not the high perfection of my loss thy clarence he is dead that kill my edward , and the beholders of this tragic play , the adulterate hastings , rivers , vaughan , grey , untimely smother in their dusky graves .
richard yet lives , hell black intelligencer , only reserved their factor , to buy souls and send them thither but at hand , at hand , ensues his piteous and unpitied end earth gapes , hell burns , fiends roar , saints pray .
to have him suddenly convey away .
cancel his bond of life , dear god , i prey , that i may live to say , the dog is dead !
o , thou didst prophesy the time would come that i should wish for thee to help me curse that bottled spider , that foul toad !
i call thee then vain flourish of my fortune , i call thee then poor shadow , painted queen , the presentation of but what i was , the flattering index of a direful pageant , one heaved , to be hurl down below , a mother only mock with two sweet babes , a dream of what thou wert , a breath , a bubble , a sign of dignity , a garish flag , to be the aim of every dangerous shot , a queen in jest , only to fill the scene .
where is thy husband now ?
where be thy brothers ?
where are thy children ?
wherein dost thou , joy ?
who sues to thee and cries save the queen ' ?
where be the bending peers that flatter thee ?
where be the thronging troops that follow thee ?
decline all this , and see what now thou art for happy wife , a most distressed widow , for joyful mother , one that wails the name , for queen , a very caitiff crown with care , for one being sued to , one that humbly sues , for one that scorn at me , now scorn of me , for one being fear of all , now fearing one , for one commanding all , obey of none .
thus hath the course of justice wheel about , and left thee but a very prey to time , having no more but thought of what thou wert , to torture thee the more , being what thou art .
thou didst usurp my place , and dost thou not usurp the just proportion of my sorrow ?
now thy proud neck bears half my burthen yoke , from which even here i slip my weary neck , and leave the burthen of it all on thee .
farewell , york wife , and queen of sad mischance these english woes will make me smile in france .
o thou well skill in curses , stay awhile , and teach me how to curse mine enemies !
forbear to sleep the nights , and fast the days , compare dead happiness with living woe , think that thy babes were fairer than they were , and he that slew them fouler than he is bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse revolving this will teach thee how to curse .
my words are dull , o , quicken them with thine !
thy woes will make them sharp , and pierce like mine .
exit why should calamity be full of words ?
windy attorneys to their client woes , airy succeeders of intestate joys , poor breathing orators of miseries !
let them have scope though what they do impart help not all , yet do they ease the heart .
if so , then be not go with me .
and in the breath of bitter words let smother my damned son , which thy two sweet sons smother .
i hear his drum be copious in exclaims .
enter king richard iii , marching , with drums and trumpets who intercepts my expedition ?
o , she that might have intercepted thee , by strangling thee in her accursed womb from all the slaughters , wretch , that thou hast done !
hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown , where should be graven , if that right were right , the slaughter of the prince that owed that crown , and the dire death of my two sons and brothers ?
tell me , thou villain slave , where are my children ?
thou toad , thou toad , where is thy brother clarence ?
and little ned plantagenet , his son ?
where is kind hastings , rivers , vaughan , grey ?
a flourish , trumpets !
strike alarum , drums !
let not the heavens hear these women rail on the lord enointed strike , i say !
flourish .
alarums either be patient , and entreat me fair , or with the clamorous report of war thus will i drown your exclamations .
art thou my son ?
ay , i thank god , my father , and yourself .
then patiently hear my impatience .
madam , i have a touch of your condition , which can not brook the accent of reproof .
o , let me speak !
do then but i not hear .
i will be mild and gentle in my speech .
and brief , good mother , for i am in haste .
art thou so hasty ?
i have stay for thee , god knows , in anguish , pain and agony .
and came i not at last to comfort you ?
no , by the holy rood , thou it well , thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell .
a grievous burthen was thy birth to me , tetchy and wayward was thy infancy , thy frightful , desperate , wild , and furious , thy prime of manhood daring , bold , and venturous , thy age confirm , proud , subdued , bloody , treacherous , more mild , but yet more harmful , kind in hatred what comfortable hour canst thou name , that ever graced me in thy company ?
faith , none , but humphrey hour , that call your grace to breakfast once forth of my company .
if i be so disgracious in your sight , let me march on , and not offend your grace .
strike the drum .
i prithee , hear me speak .
you speak too bitterly .
hear me a word , for i shall never speak to thee again .
so .
either thou wilt die , by god just ordinance , ere from this war thou turn a conqueror , or i with grief and extreme age shall perish and never look upon thy face again .
therefore take with thee my most heavy curse , which , in the day of battle , tire thee more than all the complete armour that thou !
my prayers on the adverse party fight , and there the little souls of edward children whisper the spirits of thine enemies and promise them success and victory .
bloody thou art , bloody will be thy end , shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend .
exit though far more cause , yet much less spirit to curse abides in me , i say amen to all .
stay , madam , i must speak a word with you .
i have no more sons of the royal blood for thee to murder for my daughters , richard , they shall be praying nuns , not weeping queens , and therefore level not to hit their lives .
you have a daughter call elizabeth , virtuous and fair , royal and gracious .
and must she die for this ?
o , let her live , and i corrupt her manners , stain her beauty , slander myself as false to edward bed , throw over her the veil of infamy so she may live unscarr of bleeding slaughter , i will confess she was not edward daughter .
wrong not her birth , she is of royal blood .
to save her life , i say she is not so .
her life is only safest in her birth .
and only in that safety died her brothers .
lo , at their births good stars were opposite .
no , to their lives bad friends were contrary .
all unavoided is the doom of destiny .
true , when avoided grace makes destiny my babes were destined to a fairer death , if grace had bless thee with a fairer life .
you speak as if that i had slain my cousins .
cousins , indeed , and by their uncle cozen of comfort , kingdom , kindred , freedom , life .
whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts , thy head , all indirectly , gave direction no doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt till it was whetted on thy heart , to revel in the entrails of my lambs .
but that still use of grief makes wild grief tame , my tongue should to thy ears not name my boys till that my nails were anchor in thine eyes , and i , in such a desperate bay of death , like a poor bark , of sails and tackling reft , rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom .
madam , so thrive i in my enterprise and dangerous success of bloody wars , as i intend more good to you and yours , than ever you or yours were by me wrong !
what good is cover with the face of heaven , to be discover , that can do me good ?
the advancement of your children , gentle lady .
up to some scaffold , there to lose their heads ?
no , to the dignity and height of honour the high imperial type of this earth glory .
flatter my sorrows with report of it , tell me what state , what dignity , what honour , canst thou demise to any child of mine ?
even all i have , yea , and myself and all , will i withal endow a child of thine , so in the lethe of thy angry soul thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs which thou supposest i have done to thee .
be brief , lest that be process of thy kindness last longer telling than thy kindness ' date .
then know , that from my soul i love thy daughter .
my daughter mother thinks it with her soul .
what do you think ?
that thou dost love my daughter from thy soul so from thy soul love didst thou love her brothers , and from my heart love i do thank thee for it .
be not so hasty to confound my meaning i mean , that with my soul i love thy daughter , and mean to make her queen of england .
say then , who dost thou mean shall be her king ?
even he that makes her queen who should be else ?
what , thou ?
i , even i what think you of it , madam ?
how canst thou woo her ?
that would i learn of you , as one that are best acquainted with her humour .
and wilt thou learn of me ?
madam , with all my heart .
send to her , by the man that slew her brothers , a pair of , thereon engrave edward and york , then haply she will weep therefore present to her as sometime margaret did to thy father , steep in rutland blood , a handkerchief , which , say to her , did drain the purple sap from her sweet brother body and bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith .
if this inducement force her not to love , send her a story of thy noble acts , tell her thou madest away her uncle clarence , her uncle rivers , yea , and , for her sake , madest quick conveyance with her good aunt anne .
come , come , you mock me , this is not the way to win our daughter .
there is no other way unless thou couldst put on some other shape , and not be richard that hath done all this .
say that i did all this for love of her .
nay , then indeed she can not choose but hate thee , having bought love with such a bloody spoil .
look , what is done can not be now amended men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes , which after hours give leisure to repent .
if i did take the kingdom from your sons , to make amends , ill give it to your daughter .
if i have kill the issue of your womb , to quicken your increase , i will beget mine issue of your blood upon your daughter a grandam name is little less in love than is the doting title of a mother , they are as children but one step below , even of your mettle , of your very blood , of an one pain , save for a night of groans endured of her , for whom you bid like sorrow .
your children were vexation to your youth , but mine shall be a comfort to your age .
the loss you have is but a son being king , and by that loss your daughter is made queen .
i can not make you what amends i would , therefore accept such kindness as i can .
dorset your son , that with a fearful soul leads discontented steps in foreign soil , this fair alliance quickly shall call home to high promotions and great dignity the king , that calls your beauteous daughter wife .
familiarly shall call thy dorset brother , again shall you be mother to a king , and all the ruins of distressful times repair with double riches of content .
what !
we have many goodly days to see the liquid drops of tears that you have shed shall come again , transform to orient pearl , advantaging their loan with interest of ten times double gain of happiness .
go , then my mother , to thy daughter go make bold her bashful years with your experience , prepare her ears to hear a wooer tale put in her tender heart the aspiring flame of golden sovereignty , acquaint the princess with the sweet silent hours of marriage joys and when this arm of mine hath chastised the petty rebel , buckingham , bound with triumphant garlands will i come and lead thy daughter to a conqueror bed , to whom i will retail my conquest won , and she shall be sole victress , caesar caesar .
what were i best to say ?
her father brother would be her lord ?
or shall i say , her uncle ?
or , he that slew her brothers and her uncles ?
under what title shall i woo for thee , that god , the law , my honour and her love , can make seem pleasing to her tender years ?
infer fair england peace by this alliance .
which she shall purchase with still lasting war .
say that the king , which may command , entreats .
that at her hands which the king king forbids .
say , she shall be a high and mighty queen .
to wail the tide , as her mother doth .
say , i will love her everlastingly .
but how long shall that title ' last ?
sweetly in force unto her fair life end .
but how long fairly shall her sweet lie last ?
so long as heaven and nature lengthens it .
so long as hell and richard likes of it .
say , i , her sovereign , am her subject love .
but she , your subject , loathes such sovereignty .
be eloquent in my behalf to her .
an honest tale speeds best being plainly told .
then in plain terms tell her my loving tale .
plain and not honest is too harsh a style .
your reasons are too shallow and too quick .
o no , my reasons are too deep and dead , too deep and dead , poor infants , in their grave .
harp not on that string , madam , that is past .
harp on it still shall i till break .
now , by my george , my garter , and my crown , profaned , dishonour , and the third usurp .
i swear by nothing , for this is no oath the george , profaned , hath lost his holy honour , the garter , blemish , pawn his knightly virtue , the crown , usurp , disgraced his kingly glory .
if something thou wilt swear to be believed , swear then by something that thou hast not wrong .
now , by the world is full of thy foul wrongs .
my father death thy life hath that dishonour .
then , by myself thyself thyself misusest .
why then , by god god wrong is most of all .
if thou hadst fear to break an oath by him , the unity the king thy brother made had not been broken , nor my brother slain if thou hadst fear to break an oath by him , the imperial metal , circling now thy brow , had graced the tender temples of my child , and both the princes had been breathing here , which now , two tender playfellows to dust , thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms .
what canst thou swear by now ?
the time to come .
that thou hast wronged in the time , for i myself have many tears to wash hereafter time , for time past wrong by thee .
the children live , whose parents thou hast slaughter , ungovern youth , to wail it in their age , the parents live , whose children thou hast butcher , old wither plants , to wail it with their age .
swear not by time to come , for that thou hast misused ere used , by time misused .
as i intend to prosper and repent , so thrive i in my dangerous attempt of hostile arms !
myself myself confound !
heaven and fortune bar me happy hours !
day , yield me not thy light , nor , night , thy rest !
be opposite all planets of good luck to my proceedings , if , with pure heart love , immaculate devotion , holy thoughts , i tender not thy beauteous princely daughter !
in her consists my happiness and thine , without her , follows to this land and me , to thee , herself , and many a christian soul , death , desolation , ruin and decay it can not be avoided but by this , it will not be avoided but by this .
therefore , good mother , i must can you so be the attorney of my love to her plead what i will be , not what i have been , not my deserts , but what i will deserve urge the necessity and state of times , and be not in great designs .
shall i be tempted of the devil thus ?
ay , if the devil tempt thee to do good .
shall i forget myself to be myself ?
ay , if yourself remembrance wrong yourself .
but thou didst kill my children .
but in your daughter womb i bury them where in that nest of spicery they shall breed selves of themselves , to your recomforture .
shall i go win my daughter to thy will ?
and be a happy mother by the deed .
i go .
write to me very shortly .
and you shall understand from me her mind .
bear her my true love kiss , and so , farewell .
exit queen elizabeth relenting fool , and shallow , changing woman !

o coward conscience , how dost thou afflict me !
the lights burn blue .
it is now dead midnight .
cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh .
what do i fear ?
myself ?
there none else by richard loves richard , that is , i am i .
is there a murderer here ?
no .
yes , i am then fly .
what , from myself ?
great reason why lest i revenge .
what , myself upon myself ?
alack .
i love myself .
wherefore ?
for any good that i myself have done unto myself ?
o , no !
alas , i rather hate myself for hateful deeds committed by myself !
i am a villain yet i lie .
i am not .
fool , of thyself speak well fool , do not flatter .
my conscience hath a thousand several tongues , and every tongue brings in a several tale , and every tale condemns me for a villain .
perjury , perjury , in the degree murder , stem murder , in the direst degree , all several sins , all used in each degree , throng to the bar , crying all , guilty !
guilty !
i shall despair .
there is no creature loves me , and if i die , no soul shall pity me nay , wherefore should they , since that i myself find in myself no pity to myself ?
methought the souls of all that i had murder came to my tent , and every one did threat vengeance on the head of richard .
enter ratcliff my lord !

who is there ?
ratcliff , my lord , is i .
the early hath twice done salutation to the morn , your friends are up , and buckle on their armour .
o ratcliff , i have dream a fearful dream !
what thinkest thou , will our friends prove all true ?
no doubt , my lord .
o ratcliff , i fear , i fear , nay , good my lord , be not afraid of shadows .
by the apostle paul , shadows have struck more terror to the soul of richard than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers armed in proof , and led by shallow richmond .
it is not yet near day .
come , go with me , under our tents i play the , to see if any mean to shrink from me .
exeunt enter the lords to richmond , sitting in his tent good morrow , richmond !
cry mercy , lords and watchful gentlemen , that you have a tardy sluggard here .
how have you slept , my lord ?
the sweetest sleep , and dreams that ever enter in a drowsy head , have i since your departure had , my lords .
methought their souls , whose bodies richard murder , came to my tent , and cried on victory i promise you , my soul is very jocund in the remembrance of so fair a dream .
how far into the morning is it , lords ?
upon the stroke of four .
why , then is time to arm and give direction .
his oration to his soldiers more than i have said , loving countrymen , the leisure and enforcement of the time forbids to dwell upon yet remember this , god and our good cause fight upon our side , the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls , like bulwarks , stand before our faces , richard except , those whom we fight against had rather have us win than him they follow for what is he they follow ?
truly , gentlemen , a bloody tyrant and a homicide , one raised in blood , and one in blood establish , one that made means to come by what he hath , and slaughter those that were the means to help him , abase foul stone , made precious by the foil of england chair , where he is falsely set , one that hath ever been god enemy then , if you fight against god enemy , god will in justice ward you as his soldiers , if you do sweat to put a tyrant down , you sleep in peace , the tyrant being slain , if you do fight against your country foes , your country fat shall pay your pains the hire , if you do fight in safeguard of your wives , your wives shall welcome home the conquerors , if you do free your children from the sword , your children children quit it in your age .
then , in the name of god and all these rights , advance your standards , draw your willing swords .
for me , the ransom of my bold attempt shall be this cold corpse on the earth cold face , but if i thrive , the gain of my attempt the least of you shall share his part thereof .
sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully , god and saint george !
richmond and victory !
exeunt king richard , ratcliff , attendants and forces what said northumberland as touching richmond ?
that he was never trained up in arms .
he said the truth and what said surrey then ?
he smiled and said better for our purpose . '
he was in the right , and so indeed it is .
clock striketh ten the clock there .
give me a calendar .
who saw the sun ?
not i , my lord .
then he disdains to shine , for by the book he should have braved the east an hour ago a black day will it be to somebody .
ratcliff !
my lord ?
the sun will not be seen , the sky doth frown and lour upon our army .
i would these dewy tears were from the ground .
not shine !
why , what is that to me more than to richmond ?
for the selfsame heaven that frowns on me looks sadly upon him .

they thus directed , we will follow in the main battle , whose puissance on either side shall be well winged with our chiefest horse .
this , and saint george to boot !
what thou , norfolk ?
a good direction , warlike sovereign .
this found i on my tent this morning .
he sheweth him a paper reads of norfolk , be not too bold , for dickon thy master is bought and sold . '
a thing devised by the enemy .
go , gentleman , every man unto his charge let not our babbling dreams affright our souls conscience is but a word that cowards use , devised at first to keep the strong in awe our strong arms be our conscience , swords our law .
march on , join bravely , let us if not to heaven , then hand in hand to hell .
his oration to his army what shall i say more than i have inferr ?
remember whom you are to cope withal , a sort of vagabonds , rascals , and runaways , a scum of bretons , and base lackey peasants , whom their country vomits forth to desperate ventures and assured destruction .
you sleeping safe , they bring to you unrest , you having lands , and blest with beauteous wives , they would restrain the one , distain the other .
and who doth lead them but a paltry fellow , long kept in bretagne at our mother cost ?
a , one that never in his life felt so much cold as over shoes in snow ?
let whip these stragglers the seas again , lash hence these overweening rags of france , these famish beggars , weary of their lives , who , but for dreaming on this fond exploit , for want of means , poor rats , had hang themselves if we be conquer , let men conquer us , and not these bastard bretons , whom our fathers have in their own land beaten , bobb , and thump , and in record , left them the heirs of shame .
shall these enjoy our lands ?
lie with our wives ?
ravish our daughters ?
drum afar off hark !
i hear their drum .
fight , gentlemen of england !
fight , bold yoemen !
draw , archers , draw your arrows to the head !
spur your proud horses hard , and ride in blood , amaze the welkin with your broken staves !
enter a messenger what says lord stanley ?
will he bring his power ?
my lord , he doth deny to come .
off with his son george head !
my lord , the enemy is past the marsh after the battle let george stanley die .
a thousand hearts are great within my bosom advance our standards , set upon our foes our ancient word of courage , fair saint george , inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons !
upon them !
victory sits on our helms .

here were the servants of your adversary , and yours , close fighting ere i did approach i drew to part them in the instant came the fiery tybalt , with his sword prepared , which , as he breathed defiance to my ears , he swung about his head and cut the winds , who nothing hurt withal hiss him in scorn while we were interchanging thrusts and blows , came more and more and fought on part and part , till the prince came , who parted either part .
o , where is romeo ?
saw you him ?
right glad i am he was not at this fray .
madam , an hour before the worshipp sun peer forth the golden window of the east , a troubled mind drave me to walk abroad , where , underneath the grove of sycamore that westward rooteth from the city side , so early walking did i see your son towards him i made , but he was ware of me and stole into the covert of the wood i , measuring his affections by my own , that most are busied when they most alone , pursued my humour not pursuing his , and gladly shunn who gladly fled from me .
many a morning hath he there been seen , with tears augmenting the fresh morning dew .
adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs , but all so soon as the sun should in the furthest east begin to draw the shady curtains from aurora bed , away from the light steals home my heavy son , and private in his chamber pens himself , shuts up his windows , locks far daylight out and makes himself an artificial night black and portentous must this humour prove , unless good counsel may the cause remove .
my noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
i neither know it nor can learn of him .
have you importuned him by any means ?
both by myself and many other friends but he , his own affections ' counsellor , is to himself i will not say how true but to himself so secret and so close , so far from sounding and discovery , as is the bud bit with an envious worm , ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air , or dedicate his beauty to the sun .
could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow .
we would as willingly give cure as know .
enter romeo see , where he comes so please you , step aside , i know his grievance , or be much denied .
i would thou wert so happy by thy stay , to hear true shrift .
come , madam , let away .
exeunt montague and lady montague , cousin .
is the day so young ?
but new struck nine .
ay me !
sad hours seem long .
was that my father that went hence so fast ?
it was .
what sadness lengthens romeo hours ?
not having that , which , having , makes them short .
in love ?
out of love ?
out of her favour , where i am in love .
alas , that love , so gentle in his view , should be so tyrannous and rough in proof !
alas , that love , whose view is muffled still , should , without eyes , see pathways to his will !
where shall we dine ?
o me !
what fray was here ?
yet tell me not , for i have heard it all .
here much to do with hate , but more with love .
why , then , o brawling love !
o loving hate !
o any thing , of nothing first create !
o heavy lightness !
serious vanity !
chaos of forms !
feather of lead , bright smoke , cold fire , sick health !
sleep , that is not what it is !
this love feel i , that feel no love in this .
dost thou not laugh ?
no , coz , i rather weep .
good heart , at what ?
at thy good heart oppression .
why , such is love transgression .
griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast , which thou wilt propagate , to have it prest with more of thine this love that thou hast shown doth add more grief to too much of mine own .
love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs , being purged , a fire sparkling in lovers ' eyes , being vex a sea nourish with lovers ' tears what is it else ?
a madness most discreet , a choking gall and a preserving sweet .
farewell , my coz .
soft !
i will go along , an if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
tut , i have lost myself , i am not here , this is not romeo , he some other where .
tell me in sadness , who is that you love .
what , shall i groan and tell thee ?
groan !
why , no .
but sadly tell me who .
bid a sick man in sadness make his will ah , word ill urged to one that is so ill !
in sadness , cousin , i do love a woman .
i aim so near , when i supposed you loved .
a right good !
and she fair i love .
a right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .
well , in that hit you miss she not be hit with cupid arrow , she hath dian wit , and , in strong proof of chastity well arm , from love weak childish bow she lives unharm .
she will not stay the siege of loving terms , nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes , nor ope her lap to gold o , she is rich in beauty , only poor , that when she dies with beauty dies her store .
then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste ?
she hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , for beauty starved with her severity cuts beauty off from all posterity .
she is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , to merit bliss by making me despair she hath forsworn to love , and in that vow do i live dead that live to tell it now .
be ruled by me , forget to think of her .
o , teach me how i should forget to think .
by giving liberty unto thine eyes , examine other beauties .
is the way to call hers exquisite , in question more these happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows being black put us in mind they hide the fair , he that is strucken blind can not forget the precious treasure of his eyesight lost show me a mistress that is passing fair , what doth her beauty serve , but as a note where i may read who pass that passing fair ?
farewell thou canst not teach me to forget .
i pay that doctrine , or else die in debt .
exeunt scene ii .
a street .
enter capulet , paris , and servant but montague is bound as well as i , in penalty alike , and is not hard , i think , for men so old as we to keep the peace .
of honourable reckoning are you both , and pity is you lived at odds so long .
but now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?
but saying what i have said before my child is yet a stranger in the world , she hath not seen the change of fourteen years , let two more summers wither in their pride , ere we may think her ripe to be a bride .
younger than she are happy mothers made .
and too soon marr are those so early made .
the earth hath swallow all my hopes but she , she is the hopeful lady of my earth but woo her , gentle paris , get her heart , my will to her consent is but a part , an she agree , within her scope of choice lies my consent and fair according voice .
this night i hold an old accustom feast , whereto i have invited many a guest , such as i love , and you , among the store , one more , most welcome , makes my number more .
at my poor house look to behold this night stars that make dark heaven light such comfort as do lusty young men feel when april on the heel of limping winter treads , even such delight among fresh female buds shall you this night inherit at my house , hear all , all see , and like her most whose merit most shall be which on more view , of many mine being one may stand in number , though in reckoning none , come , go with me .
to servant , giving a paper go , sirrah , trudge about through fair verona , find those persons out whose names are written there , and to them say , my house and welcome on their pleasure stay .
exeunt capulet and paris find them out whose names are written here !
it is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard , and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil , and the painter with his nets , but i am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .
i must to the in good time .
enter benvolio and romeo tut , man , one fire burns out another burning , one pain is lessen by another anguish , turn giddy , and be holp by backward turning , one desperate grief cures with another languish take thou some new infection to thy eye , and the rank poison of the old will die .
your is excellent for that .
for what , i pray thee ?
for your broken shin .
why , romeo , art thou mad ?
not mad , but bound more than a is , shut up in prison , kept without my food , whipp and tormented and , good fellow .
god gi ' .
i pray , sir , can you read ?
ay , mine own fortune in my misery .
perhaps you have learned it without book but , i pray , can you read any thing you see ?
ay , if i know the letters and the language .
ye say honestly rest you merry !
stay , fellow , i can read .
reads martino and his wife and daughters , county anselme and his beauteous sisters , the lady widow of vitravio , signior placentio and his lovely nieces , mercutio and his brother valentine , mine uncle capulet , his wife and daughters , my fair niece rosaline , livia , signior valentio and his cousin tybalt , lucio and the lively helena . '
a fair assembly whither should they come ?

whose house ?

indeed , i should have ask you that before .
now i tell you without asking my master is the great rich capulet , and if you be not of the house of montagues , i pray , come and crush a cup of wine .
rest you merry !
exit at this same ancient feast of capulet sups the fair rosaline whom thou so lovest , with all the admired beauties of verona go thither , and , with unattainted eye , compare her face with some that i shall show , and i will make thee think thy swan a crow .
when the devout religion of mine eye maintains such falsehood , then turn tears to fires , and these , who often drown could never die , transparent heretics , be burnt for liars !
one fairer than my love !
the sun saw her match since first the world begun .
tut , you saw her fair , none else being by , herself poised with herself in either eye but in that crystal scales let there be weigh your lady love against some other maid that i will show you shining at this feast , and she shall scant show well that now shows best .
i go along , no such sight to be shown , but to rejoice in splendor of mine own .
exeunt scene iii .
a room in capulet house .
enter lady capulet and nurse nurse , where my daughter ?
call her forth to me .
now , by my maidenhead , at twelve year old , i bade her come .
what , lamb !
what , ladybird !
god forbid !
where this girl ?
what , juliet !
enter juliet how now !
who calls ?
your mother .
madam , i am here .
what is your will ?
this is the matter nurse , give leave awhile , we must talk in secret nurse , come back again , i have remember me , thou hear our counsel .
thou my daughter of a pretty age .
faith , i can tell her age unto an hour .
she not fourteen .
i lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teeth be it spoken , i have but four she is not fourteen .
how long is it now to ?
a fortnight and odd days .
even or odd , of all days in the year , come at night shall she be fourteen .
susan and she god rest all christian souls ! were of an age well , susan is with god , she was too good for me but , as i said , on at night shall she be fourteen , that shall she , marry , i remember it well .
is since the earthquake now eleven years , and she was wean , i never shall forget it , of all the days of the year , upon that day for i had then laid wormwood to my dug , sitting in the sun under the wall , my lord and you were then at mantua nay , i do bear a brain but , as i said , when it did taste the wormwood on the nipple of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , to see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !
shake quoth the was no need , i trow , to bid me trudge and since that time it is eleven years , for then she could stand alone , nay , by the rood , she could have run and waddled all about , for even the day before , she broke her brow and then my husband god be with his soul !
a ' was a merry man took up the child , ' quoth he , thou fall upon thy face ?
thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit , wilt thou not , jule ? '
and , by my holidame , the pretty wretch left crying and said . '
to see , now , how a jest shall come about !
i warrant , an i should live a thousand years , i never should forget it thou not , jule ? '
quoth he , and , pretty fool , it stinted and said . '
enough of this , i pray thee , hold thy peace .
yes , madam yet i can not choose but laugh , to think it should leave crying and say . '
and yet , i warrant , it had upon its brow a bump as big as a young cockerel stone , a parlous knock , and it cried bitterly , ' quoth my husband , upon thy face ?
thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age , wilt thou not , jule ? '
it stinted and said . '
and stint thou too , i pray thee , nurse , say i .
peace , i have done .
god mark thee to his grace !
thou wast the prettiest babe that i nursed an i might live to see thee married once , i have my wish .
marry , that ' is the very theme i came to talk of .
tell me , daughter juliet , how stands your disposition to be married ?
it is an honour that i dream not of .
an honour !
were not i thine only nurse , i would say thou hadst suck wisdom from thy teat .
well , think of marriage now , younger than you , here in verona , ladies of esteem , are made already mothers by my count , i was your mother much upon these years that you are now a maid .
thus then in brief the valiant paris seeks you for his love .
a man , young lady !
lady , such a man as all the world why , he a man of wax .
verona summer hath not such a flower .
nay , he a flower , in faith , a very flower .
what say you ?
can you love the gentleman ?
this night you shall behold him at our feast , read the volume of young paris ' face , and find delight writ there with beauty pen , examine every married lineament , and see how one another lends content and what obscured in this fair volume lies find written in the margent of his eyes .
this precious book of love , this unbound lover , to beautify him , only lacks a cover the fish lives in the sea , and is much pride for fair without the fair within to hide that book in many eyes doth share the glory , that in gold clasps locks in the golden story , so shall you share all that he doth possess , by having him , making yourself no less .
no less !
nay , bigger , women grow by men .
speak briefly , can you like of paris ' love ?
i look to like , if looking liking move but no more deep will i endart mine eye than your consent gives strength to make it fly .
enter a servant madam , the guests are come , supper served up , you called , my young lady asked for , the nurse cursed in the pantry , and every thing in extremity .
i must hence to wait , i beseech you , follow straight .
we follow thee .
exit servant juliet , the county stays .
go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .
exeunt scene iv .
a street .
enter romeo , mercutio , benvolio , with five or six maskers , , and others what , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?
or shall we on without a apology ?
the date is out of such prolixity we have no cupid hoodwink with a scarf , bearing a tartar painted bow of lath , scaring the ladies like a , nor no prologue , faintly spoke after the prompter , for our entrance but let them measure us by what they will , we measure them a measure , and be gone .
give me a torch i am not for this ambling , being but heavy , i will bear the light .
nay , gentle romeo , we must have you dance .
not i , believe me you have dancing shoes with nimble soles i have a soul of lead so stakes me to the ground i can not move .
you are a lover , borrow cupid wings , and soar with them above a common bound .
i am too sore enpierced with his shaft to soar with his light feathers , and so bound , i can not bound a pitch above dull woe under love heavy burden do i sink .
and , to sink in it , should you burden love , too great oppression for a tender thing .
is love a tender thing ?
it is too rough , too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .
if love be rough with you , be rough with love , prick love for pricking , and you beat love down .
give me a case to put my visage in a visor for a visor !
what care i what curious eye doth quote deformities ?
here are the beetle brows shall blush for me .
come , knock and enter , and no sooner in , but every man betake him to his legs .
a torch for me let wantons light of heart tickle the senseless rushes with their heels , for i am proverb with a grandsire phrase , i be a , and look on .
the game was so fair , and i am done .
tut , dun the mouse , the constable own word if thou art dun , we draw thee from the mire of this love , wherein thou up to the ears .
come , we burn daylight , ho !
nay , that not so .
i mean , sir , in delay we waste our lights in vain , like lamps by day .
take our good meaning , for our judgment sits five times in that ere once in our five wits .
and we mean well in going to this mask , but is no wit to go .
why , may one ask ?
i dream a dream .
and so did i .
well , what was yours ?
that dreamers often lie .
in bed asleep , while they do dream things true .
o , then , i see queen mab hath been with you .
she is the fairies ' midwife , and she comes in shape no bigger than an on the of an alderman , drawn with a team of little atomies athwart men noses as they lie asleep , her made of long spiders ' legs , the cover of the wings of grasshoppers , the traces of the smallest spider web , the collars of the moonshine watery beams , her whip of cricket bone , the lash of film , her wagoner a small gnat , not so big as a round little worm prick from the lazy finger of a maid , her chariot is an empty made by the joiner squirrel or old grub , time out o ' mind the fairies ' coachmakers .
and in this state she gallops night by night through lovers ' brains , and then they dream of love , courtiers ' knees , that dream on straight , lawyers ' fingers , who straight dream on fees , ladies ' lips , who straight on kisses dream , which oft the angry mab with blisters plagues , because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are sometime she gallops a courtier nose , and then dreams he of smelling out a suit , and sometime comes she with a tail tickling a parson nose as a ' lies asleep , then dreams , he of another benefice sometime she driveth a soldier neck , and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats , of breaches , ambuscadoes , spanish blades , of healths deep , and then anon drums in his ear , at which he starts and wakes , and being thus frighted swears a prayer or two and sleeps again .
this is that very mab that plats the manes of horses in the night , and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs , which once untangled , much misfortune bodes this is the hag , when maids lie on their backs , that presses them and learns them first to bear , making them women of good carriage this is she peace , peace , mercutio , peace !
thou of nothing .
true , i talk of dreams , which are the children of an idle brain , begot of nothing but vain fantasy , which is as thin of substance as the air and more inconstant than the wind , who wooes even now the frozen bosom of the north , and , being anger , puffs away from thence , turning his face to the south .
this wind , you talk of , blows us from ourselves , supper is done , and we shall come too late .
i fear , too early for my mind misgives some consequence yet hanging in the stars shall bitterly begin his fearful date with this night revels and expire the term of a despised life closed in my breast by some vile forfeit of untimely death .
but he , that hath the steerage of my course , direct my sail !
on , lusty gentlemen .
strike , drum .
exeunt scene a hall in capulet house .
musicians waiting .
enter servingmen with napkins where potpan , that he helps not to take away ?
he shift a trencher ?
he scrape a trencher !
when good manners shall lie all in one or two men hands and they unwashed too , is a foul thing .
away with the , remove the , look to the plate .
good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou lovest me , let the porter let in susan grindstone and nell .
antony , and potpan !
ay , boy , ready .
you are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .
we can not be here and there too .
cheerly , boys , be brisk awhile , and the longer liver take all .
enter capulet , with juliet and others of his house , meeting the guests and maskers welcome , gentlemen !
ladies that have their toes unplagued with corns will have a bout with you .
ah ha , my mistresses !
which of you all will now deny to dance ?
she that makes dainty , she , i swear , hath corns , am i come near ye now ?
welcome , gentlemen !
i have seen the day that i have worn a visor and could tell a whispering tale in a fair lady ear , such as would please is gone , is gone , is gone you are welcome , gentlemen !
come , musicians , play .
a hall , a hall !
give room !
and foot it , girls .
music plays , and they dance more light , you knaves , and turn the tables up , and quench the fire , the room is grown too hot .
ah , sirrah , this sport comes well .
nay , sit , nay , sit , good cousin capulet , for you and i are past our dancing days how long now since last yourself and i were in a mask ?
by ' r lady , thirty years .
what , man !
is not so much , is not so much is since the nuptials of lucentio , come pentecost as quickly as it will , some five and twenty years , and then we mask .
is more , is more , his son is elder , sir , his son is thirty .
will you tell me that ?
his son was but a ward two years ago .
to a servingman what lady is that , which doth enrich the hand of yonder knight ?
i know not , sir .
o , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !
it seems she hangs upon the cheek of night like a rich jewel in an ethiope ear , beauty too rich for use , for earth too dear !
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows , as yonder lady her fellows shows .
the measure done , i watch her place of stand , and , touching hers , make blessed my rude hand .
did my heart love till now ?
forswear it , sight !
for i saw true beauty till this night .
this , by his voice , should be a montague .
fetch me my rapier , boy .
what dares the slave come hither , cover with an antic face , to fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?
now , by the stock and honour of my kin , to strike him dead , i hold it not a sin .
why , how now , kinsman !
wherefore storm you so ?
uncle , this is a montague , our foe , a villain that is hither come in spite , to scorn at our solemnity this night .
young romeo is it ?
is he , that villain romeo .
content thee , gentle coz , let him alone , he bears him like a portly gentleman , and , to say truth , verona brags of him to be a virtuous and youth i would not for the wealth of all the town here in my house do him disparagement therefore be patient , take no note of him it is my will , the which if thou respect , show a fair presence and put off these frowns , and semblance for a feast .
it fits , when such a villain is a guest i not endure him .
he shall be endured what , goodman boy !
i say , he shall go to , am i the master here , or you ?
go to .
you not endure him !
god shall mend my soul !
you make a mutiny among my guests !
you will set !
you be the man !
why , uncle , is a shame .
go to , go to , you are a saucy boy so , indeed ?
this trick may chance to scathe you , i know what you must contrary me !
marry , is time .
well said , my hearts !
you are a princox , go be quiet , or more light , more light !
for shame !
i make you quiet .
what , cheerly , my hearts !
patience perforce with wilful choler meeting makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting .
i will withdraw but this intrusion shall now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall .
exit to juliet if i profane with my unworthiest hand this holy shrine , the gentle fine is this my lips , two blushing pilgrims , ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss .
good pilgrim , you do wrong your hand too much , which mannerly devotion shows in this , for saints have hands that pilgrims ' hands do touch , and palm to palm is holy palmers ' kiss .
have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?
ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .
o , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do , they pray , grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .
saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .
then move not , while my prayer effect i take .
thus from my lips , by yours , my sin is purged .
then have my lips the sin that they have took .
sin from thy lips ?
o trespass sweetly urged !
give me my sin again .
you kiss by the book .
madam , your mother craves a word with you .
what is her mother ?
marry , bachelor , her mother is the lady of the house , and a good lady , and a wise and virtuous i nursed her daughter , that you talk withal , i tell you , he that can lay hold of her shall have the chinks .
is she a capulet ?
o dear account !
my life is my foe debt .
away , begone , the sport is at the best .
ay , so i fear , the more is my unrest .
nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone , we have a trifling foolish banquet towards .
is it so ?
why , then , i thank you all i thank you , honest gentlemen , good night .
more torches here !
come on then , let to bed .
ah , sirrah , by my fay , it waxes late i to my rest .
exeunt all but juliet and nurse come hither , nurse .
what is yond gentleman ?
the son and heir of old tiberio .
what he that now is going out of door ?
marry , that , i think , be young petrucio .
what he that follows there , that would not dance ?
i know not .
go ask his name if he be married .
my grave is like to be my wedding bed .
his name is romeo , and a montague , the only son of your great enemy .
my only love sprung from my only hate !
too early seen unknown , and known too late !
prodigious birth of love it is to me , that i must love a loathed enemy .
what this ?
what this ?
a rhyme i learn even now of one i danced withal .
one calls within . '
anon , anon !
come , let away , the strangers all are gone .
exeunt act ii prologue enter chorus now old desire doth in his lie , and young affection gapes to be his heir , that fair for which love groan for and would die , with tender juliet match , is now not fair .
now romeo is beloved and loves again , alike betwitched by the charm of looks , but to his foe supposed he must complain , and she steal love sweet bait from fearful hooks being held a foe , he may not have access to breathe such vows as lovers use to swear , and she as much in love , her means much less to meet her any where but passion lends them power , time means , to meet tempering extremities with extreme sweet .
exit scene i .
a lane by the wall of capulet orchard .
enter romeo can i go forward when my heart is here ?
turn back , dull earth , and find thy centre out .
he climbs the wall , and leaps down within it enter benvolio and mercutio romeo !
my cousin romeo !
he is wise , and , on my lie , hath him home to bed .
he ran this way , and leap this orchard wall call , good mercutio .
nay , i conjure too .
romeo !
humours !
madman !
passion !
lover !
appear thou in the likeness of a sigh speak but one rhyme , and i am satisfied , cry but me ! '
pronounce but ' and , ' speak to my gossip venus one fair word , one for her purblind son and heir , young adam cupid , he that shot so trim , when king cophetua loved the !
he heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not , the ape is dead , and i must conjure him .
i conjure thee by rosaline bright eyes , by her high forehead and her scarlet lip , by her fine foot , straight leg and quivering thigh and the demesnes that there adjacent lie , that in thy likeness thou appear to us !
and if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .
this can not anger him anger him to raise a spirit in his mistress ' circle of some strange nature , letting it there stand till she had laid it and conjured it down , that were some spite my invocation is fair and honest , and in his mistres s ' name i conjure only but to raise up him .
come , he hath hid himself among these trees , to be consorted with the humorous night blind is his love and best befits the dark .
if love be blind , love can not hit the mark .
now will he sit under a medlar tree , and wish his mistress were that kind of fruit as maids call medlars , when they laugh alone .
romeo , that she were , o , that she were an open et caetera , thou a poperin pear !
romeo , good night i to my , this is too cold for me to sleep come , shall we go ?
go , then , for is in vain to seek him here that means not to be found .
exeunt scene ii .
capulet orchard .
enter romeo he jests at scars that never felt a wound .
juliet appears above at a window but , soft !
what light through yonder window breaks ?
it is the east , and juliet is the sun .
arise , fair sun , and kill the envious moon , who is already sick and pale with grief , that thou her maid art far more fair than she be not her maid , since she is envious , her vestal livery is but sick and green and none but fools do wear it , cast it off .
it is my lady , o , it is my love !
o , that she knew she were !
she speaks yet she says nothing what of that ?
her eye discourses , i will answer it .
i am too bold , is not to me she speaks two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , having some business , do entreat her eyes to twinkle in their spheres till they return .
what if her eyes were there , they in her head ?
the brightness of her cheek would shame those stars , as daylight doth a lamp , her eyes in heaven would through the airy region stream so bright that birds would sing and think it were not night .
see , how she leans her cheek upon her hand !
o , that i were a glove upon that hand , that i might touch that cheek !
ay me !
she speaks o , speak again , bright angel !
for thou art as glorious to this night , being my head as is a winged messenger of heaven unto the wondering eyes of mortals that fall back to gaze on him when he bestrides the clouds and sails upon the bosom of the air .
o romeo , romeo !
wherefore art thou romeo ?
deny thy father and refuse thy name , or , if thou wilt not , be but sworn my love , and i no longer be a capulet .
aside shall i hear more , or shall i speak at this ?
is but thy name that is my enemy , thou art thyself , though not a montague .
what montague ?
it is nor hand , nor foot , nor arm , nor face , nor any other part belonging to a man .
o , be some other name !
what in a name ?
that which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet , so romeo would , were he not romeo call , retain that dear perfection which he owes without that title .
romeo , doff thy name , and for that name which is no part of thee take all myself .
i take thee at thy word call me but love , and i be new baptized , henceforth i never will be romeo .
what man art thou that thus bescreen in night so stumblest on my counsel ?
by a name i know not how to tell thee who i am my name , dear saint , is hateful to myself , because it is an enemy to thee , had i it written , i would tear the word .
my ears have not yet drunk a hundred words of that tongue utterance , yet i know the sound art thou not romeo and a montague ?
neither , fair saint , if either thee dislike .
how camest thou hither , tell me , and wherefore ?
the orchard walls are high and hard to climb , and the place death , considering who thou art , if any of my kinsmen find thee here .
with love light wings did i these walls , for stony limits can not hold love out , and what love can do that dares love attempt , therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me .
if they do see thee , they will murder thee .
alack , there lies more peril in thine eye than twenty of their swords look thou but sweet , and i am proof against their enmity .
i would not for the world they saw thee here .
i have night cloak to hide me from their sight , and but thou love me , let them find me here my life were better ended by their hate , than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .
by whose direction thou out this place ?
by love , who first did prompt me to inquire , he lent me counsel and i lent him eyes .
i am no pilot , yet , wert thou as far as that vast shore wash with the farthest sea , i would adventure for such merchandise .
thou the mask of night is on my face , else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek for that which thou hast heard me speak fain would i dwell on form , fain , fain deny what i have spoke but farewell compliment !
dost thou love me ?
i know thou wilt say , ' and i will take thy word yet if thou , thou mayst prove false , at lovers ' perjuries then say , jove laughs .
o gentle romeo , if thou dost love , pronounce it faithfully or if thou i am too quickly won , i frown and be perverse an say thee nay , so thou wilt woo , but else , not for the world .
in truth , fair montague , i am too fond , and therefore thou mayst think my light but trust me , gentleman , i prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange .
i should have been more strange , i must confess , but that thou , ere i was ware , my true love passion therefore pardon me , and not impute this yielding to light love , which the dark night hath so discovered .
lady , by yonder blessed moon i swear that tips with silver all these tops o , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , that monthly changes in her circled orb , lest that thy love prove likewise variable .
what shall i swear by ?
do not swear at all , or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , which is the god of my idolatry , and i believe thee .
if my heart dear love well , do not swear although i joy in thee , i have no joy of this contract it is too rash , too unadvised , too sudden , too like the lightning , which doth cease to be ere one can say lightens . '
sweet , good night !
this bud of love , by summer ripening breath , may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .
good night , good night !
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart as that within my breast !
o , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
what satisfaction canst thou have ?
the exchange of thy love faithful vow for mine .
i gave thee mine before thou didst request it and yet i would it were to give again .
wouldst thou withdraw it ?
for what purpose , love ?
but to be frank , and give it thee again .
and yet i wish but for the thing i have my bounty is as boundless as the sea , my love as deep , the more i give to thee , the more i have , for both are infinite .
nurse calls within i hear some noise within , dear love , adieu !
anon , good nurse !
sweet montague , be true .
stay but a little , i will come again .
exit , above o blessed , blessed night !
i am afeard .
being in night , all this is but a dream , too to be substantial .
juliet , above three words , dear romeo , and good night indeed .
if that thy bent of love be honourable , thy purpose marriage , send me word , by one that i procure to come to thee , where and what time thou wilt perform the rite , and all my fortunes at thy foot i lay and follow thee my lord throughout the world .
within madam !
i come , but if thou not well , i do beseech thee within madam !
by and by , i come to cease thy suit , and leave me to my grief will i send .
so thrive my soul a thousand times good night !
exit , above a thousand times the worse , to want thy light .
love goes toward love , as schoolboys from their books , but love from love , toward school with heavy looks .
retiring juliet , above hist !
romeo , hist !
o , for a falconer voice , to lure this back again !
bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , else would i tear the cave where echo lies , and make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , with repetition of my romeo name .
it is my soul that calls upon my name how sound lovers ' tongues by night , like softest music to attending ears !
romeo !
my dear ?
at what shall i send to thee ?
at the hour of nine .
i will not fail is twenty years till then .
i have forgot why i did call thee back .
let me stand here till thou remember it .
i shall forget , to have thee still stand there , remembering how i love thy company .
and i still stay , to have thee still forget , forgetting any other home but this .
is almost morning , i would have thee gone and yet no further than a wanton bird , who lets it hop a little from her hand , like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , and with a silk thread plucks it back again , so of his liberty .
i would i were thy bird .
sweet , so would i yet i should kill thee with much cherishing .
good night , good night !
parting is such sweet sorrow , that i shall say good night till it be morrow .
exit above sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast !
would i were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest !
hence will i to my ghostly father cell , his help to crave , and my dear hap to tell .
exit scene iii .
friar laurence cell .
enter friar laurence , with a basket the morn smiles on the frowning night , chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , and flecked darkness like a drunkard reels from forth day path and titan fiery wheels now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , the day to cheer and night dank dew to dry , i must this osier cage of ours with baleful weeds and flowers .
the earth that nature mother is her tomb , what is her burying grave that is her womb , and from her womb children of divers kind we sucking on her natural bosom find , many for many virtues excellent , none but for some and yet all different .
o , mickle is the powerful grace that lies in herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities for nought so vile that on the earth doth live but to the earth some special good doth give , nor aught so good but strain from that fair use revolts from true birth , stumbling on abuse virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , and vice sometimes by action dignified .
within the infant rind of this small flower poison hath residence and medicine power for this , being smelt , with that part cheers each part , being tasted , slays all senses with the heart .
two such opposed kings encamp them still in man as well as herbs , grace and rude will , and where the worser is predominant , full soon the canker death eats up that plant .
enter romeo good morrow , father .
benedicite !
what early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?
young son , it argues a distemper head so soon to bid good morrow to thy bed care keeps his watch in every old man eye , and where care lodges , sleep will never lie , but where unbruised youth with unstuff brain doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign therefore thy earliness doth me assure thou art by some distemperature , or if not so , then here i hit it right , our romeo hath not been in bed .
that last is true , the sweeter rest was mine .
god pardon sin !
wast thou with rosaline ?
with rosaline , my ghostly father ?
no , i have forgot that name , and that name woe .
that my good son but where hast thou been , then ?
i tell thee , ere thou ask it me again .
i have been feasting with mine enemy , where on a sudden one hath wounded me , that by me wounded both our remedies within thy help and holy physic lies i bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , my intercession likewise steads my foe .
be plain , good son , and homely in thy drift , riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .
then plainly know my heart dear love is set on the fair daughter of rich capulet as mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , and all combined , save what thou must combine by holy marriage when and where and how we met , we woo and made exchange of vow , i tell thee as we pass , but this i pray , that thou consent to marry us .
holy saint francis , what a change is here !
is rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , so soon forsaken ?
young men love then lies not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .
jesu maria , what a deal of brine hath wash thy sallow cheeks for rosaline !
how much salt water thrown away in waste , to season love , that of it doth not taste !
the sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears , lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit of an old tear that is not wash off yet if thou wast thyself and these woes thine , thou and these woes were all for rosaline and art thou changed ?
pronounce this sentence then , women may fall , when there no strength in men .
thou me oft for loving rosaline .
for doting , not for loving , pupil mine .
and me bury love .
not in a grave , to lay one in , another out to have .
i pray thee , chide not , she whom i love now doth grace for grace and love for love allow , the other did not so .
o , she knew well thy love did read by rote and could not spell .
but come , young waverer , come , go with me , in one respect i thy assistant be , for this alliance may so happy prove , to turn your households ' rancour to pure love .
o , let us hence , i stand on sudden haste .
wisely and slow , they stumble that run fast .
exeunt scene iv .

enter benvolio and mercutio where the devil should this romeo be ?
came he not home ?
not to his father , i spoke with his man .

torments him so , that he will sure run mad .
tybalt , the kinsman of old capulet , hath sent a letter to his father house .
a challenge , on my life .
romeo will answer it .
any man that can write may answer a letter .
nay , he will answer the letter master , how he dares , being dared .
alas poor romeo !
he is already dead , stabbed with a white wench black eye , shot through the ear with a , the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind and is he a man to encounter tybalt ?
why , what is tybalt ?
more than prince of cats , i can tell you .
o , he is the courageous captain of compliments .
he fights as you sing , keeps time , distance , and proportion , rests me his minim rest , one , two , and the third in your bosom the very butcher of a silk button , a duellist , a duellist , a gentleman of the very first house , of the first and second cause ah , the immortal passado !
the punto reverso !
the hai !
the what ?
the pox of such antic , lisping , affecting fantasticoes , these new tuners of accents !
jesu , a very good blade !
a very tall man !
a very good whore ! '

o , their bones , their bones !

signior romeo , bon jour !
there a french salutation to your french slop .
you gave us the counterfeit fairly last night .
good morrow to you both .
what counterfeit did i give you ?
the ship , sir , the slip , can you not conceive ?
pardon , good mercutio , my business was great , and in such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy .
that as much as to say , such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams .
meaning , to .
thou hast most kindly hit it .
a most courteous exposition .
nay , i am the very pink of courtesy .
pink for flower .
right .
why , then is my pump well flowered .
well said follow me this jest now till thou hast worn out thy pump , that when the single sole of it is worn , the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular .
o jest , solely singular for the singleness .
come between us , good benvolio , my wits faint .
switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or i cry a match .
nay , if thy wits run the chase , i have done , for thou hast more of the in one of thy wits than , i am sure , i have in my whole five was i with you there for the goose ?
thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast not there for the goose .
i will bite thee by the ear for that jest .
nay , good goose , bite not .
thy wit is a very bitter sweeting , it is a most sharp sauce .
and is it not well served in to a sweet goose ?
o here a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !
i stretch it out for that word , ' which added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .
why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?
now art thou sociable , now art thou romeo , now art thou what thou art , by art as well as by nature for this drivelling love is like a great natural , that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole .
stop there , stop there .
thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair .
thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .
o , thou art deceived , i would have made it short for i was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .

scurvy knave !
i am none of his , i am none of his .
and thou must stand by too , and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure ?
i saw no man use you a pleasure , if i had , my weapon should quickly have been out , i warrant you i dare draw as soon as another man , if i see occasion in a good quarrel , and the law on my side .
now , afore god , i am so vexed , that every part about me quivers .
scurvy knave !
pray you , sir , a word and as i told you , my young lady bade me inquire you out , what she bade me say , i will keep to myself but first let me tell ye , if ye should lead her into a fool paradise , as they say , it were a very gross kind of behavior , as they say for the gentlewoman is young , and , therefore , if you should deal double with her , truly it were an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman , and very weak dealing .
nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .
i protest unto thee good heart , and , i ' faith , i will tell her as much lord , lord , she will be a joyful woman .
what wilt thou tell her , nurse ?
thou dost not mark me .
i will tell her , sir , that you do protest , which , as i take it , is a gentlemanlike offer .

when was a little prating thing o , there is a nobleman in town , one paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .
i anger her sometimes and tell her that paris is the properer man , but , i warrant you , when i say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .

enter juliet the clock struck nine when i did send the nurse , in half an hour she promised to return .
perchance she can not meet him that not so .
o , she is lame !
love heralds should be thoughts , which ten times faster glide than the sun beams , driving back shadows over louring hills therefore do doves draw love , and therefore hath the cupid wings .
now is the sun upon the highmost hill of this day journey , and from nine till twelve is three long hours , yet she is not come .
had she affections and warm youthful blood , she would be as swift in motion as a ball , my words would bandy her to my sweet love , and his to me but old folks , many feign as they were dead , unwieldy , slow , heavy and pale as lead .
o god , she comes !
enter nurse and peter o honey nurse , what news ?
hast thou met with him ?

exit peter now , good sweet nurse , o lord , why thou sad ?

i am , give me leave awhile fie , how my bones ache !
what a jaunt have i had !
i would thou hadst my bones , and i thy news nay , come , i pray thee , speak , good , good nurse , speak .
jesu , what haste ?
can you not stay awhile ?
do you not see that i am out of breath ?
how art thou out of breath , when thou hast breath to say to me that thou art out of breath ?
the excuse that thou dost make in this delay is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .
is thy news good , or bad ?
answer to that , say either , and i stay the circumstance let me be satisfied , good or bad ?
well , you have made a simple choice , you know not how to choose a man romeo !
no , not he , though his face be better than any man , yet his leg excels all men , and for a hand , and a foot , and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare he is not the flower of courtesy , but , i warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .
go thy ways , wench , serve god .
what , have you dined at home ?
no , no but all this did i know before .
what says he of our marriage ?
what of that ?
lord , how my head aches !

beshrew your heart for sending me about , to catch my death with jaunting up and down !
i ' faith , i am sorry that thou art not well .

enter friar laurence and romeo so smile the heavens upon this holy act , that after hours with sorrow chide us not !
amen , amen !
but come what sorrow can , it can not countervail the exchange of joy that one short minute gives me in her sight do thou but close our hands with holy words , then death do what he dare , it is enough i may but call her mine .
these violent delights have violent ends and in their triumph die , like fire and powder , which as they kiss consume the sweetest honey is loathsome in his own deliciousness and in the taste confounds the appetite therefore love moderately , long love doth so , too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .
enter juliet here comes the lady o , so light a foot will wear out the everlasting flint a lover may bestride the gossamer that idles in the wanton summer air , and yet not fall , so light is vanity .
good even to my ghostly confessor .
romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .
as much to him , else is his thanks too much .
ah , juliet , if the measure of thy joy be heap like mine and that thy skill be more to blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath this neighbour air , and let rich music tongue unfold the imagined happiness that both receive in either by this dear encounter .
conceit , more rich in matter than in words , brags of his substance , not of ornament they are but beggars that can count their worth , but my true love is grown to such excess i can not sum up sum of half my wealth .

thou art like one of those fellows that when he enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword upon the table and says send me no need of thee ! '
and by the operation of the second cup draws it on the drawer , when indeed there is no need .
am i like such a fellow ?
come , come , thou art as hot a jack in thy mood as any in italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .
and what to ?
nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .
thou !
why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more , or a hair less , in his beard , than thou hast thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?
thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarrelling thou hast quarrelled with a man for coughing in the street , because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before easter ?
with another , for tying his new shoes with old riband ?
and yet thou wilt tutor me from quarrelling !

tybalt , the reason that i have to love thee doth much excuse the appertaining rage to such a greeting villain am i none , therefore farewell , i see thou me not .
boy , this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me , therefore turn and draw .
i do protest , i never injured thee , but love thee better than thou canst devise , till thou shalt know the reason of my love and so , good capulet , which name i tender as dearly as my own , be satisfied .
o calm , dishonourable , vile submission !

tybalt , here slain , whom romeo hand did slay , romeo that spoke him fair , bade him bethink how nice the quarrel was , and urged withal your high displeasure all this uttered with gentle breath , calm look , knees humbly bow , could not take truce with the unruly spleen of tybalt deaf to peace , but that he tilts with piercing steel at bold mercutio breast , who all as hot , turns deadly point to point , and , with a martial scorn , with one hand beats cold death aside , and with the other sends it back to tybalt , whose dexterity , retorts it romeo he cries aloud , , friends !
friends , part ! '
and , swifter than his tongue , his agile arm beats down their fatal points , and them rushes , underneath whose arm an envious thrust from tybalt hit the life of stout mercutio , and then tybalt fled , but by and by comes back to romeo , who had but newly entertain revenge , and to they go like lightning , for , ere i could draw to part them , was stout tybalt slain .
and , as he fell , did romeo turn and fly .
this is the truth , or let benvolio die .
he is a kinsman to the montague , affection makes him false , he speaks not true some twenty of them fought in this black strife , and all those twenty could but kill one life .
i beg for justice , which thou , prince , must give , romeo slew tybalt , romeo must not live .
romeo slew him , he slew mercutio , who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?
not romeo , prince , he was mercutio friend , his fault concludes but what the law should end , the life of tybalt .
and for that offence immediately we do exile him hence i have an interest in your hate proceeding , my blood for your rude brawls doth lie , but i amerce you with so strong a fine that you shall all repent the loss of mine i will be deaf to pleading and excuses , nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses therefore use none let romeo hence in haste , else , when he found , that hour is his last .
bear hence this body and attend our will mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .
exeunt scene ii .
capulet orchard .
enter juliet gallop apace , you steeds , towards phoebus ' lodging such a wagoner as phaethon would whip you to the west , and bring in cloudy night immediately .
spread thy close curtain , night , that runaway eyes may wink and romeo leap to these arms , untalk of and unseen .
lovers can see to do their amorous rites by their own beauties , or , if love be blind , it best agrees with night .
come , civil night , thou matron , all in black , and learn me how to lose a winning match , play for a pair of stainless maidenhoods hood my unmann blood , bating in my cheeks , with thy black mantle , till strange love , grown bold , think true love acted simple modesty .
come , night , come , romeo , come , thou day in night , for thou wilt lie upon the wings of night whiter than new snow on a raven back .
come , gentle night , come , loving , night , give me my romeo , and , when he shall die , take him and cut him out in little stars , and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun .
o , i have bought the mansion of a love , but not possess it , and , though i am sold , not yet enjoy so tedious is this day as is the night before some festival to an impatient child that hath new robes and may not wear them .
o , here comes my nurse , and she brings news , and every tongue that speaks but romeo name speaks heavenly eloquence .
enter nurse , with cords now , nurse , what news ?
what hast thou there ?
the cords that romeo bid thee fetch ?
ay , ay , the cords .
throws them down ay me !
what news ?
why dost thou wring thy hands ?
ah , !
he dead , he dead , he dead !
we are undone , lady , we are undone !
alack the day !
he gone , he kill , he dead !
can heaven be so envious ?
romeo can , though heaven can not o romeo , romeo !
who ever would have thought it ?
romeo !
what devil art thou , that dost torment me thus ?
this torture should be roar in dismal hell .
hath romeo slain himself ?
say thou but ' i , ' and that bare vowel ' i ' shall poison more than the eye of cockatrice i am not i , if there be such an i , or those eyes shut , that make thee answer ' i . '
if he be slain , say ' i ' , or if not , no brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .
i saw the wound , i saw it with mine eyes , god save the mark ! here on his manly breast a piteous corse , a bloody piteous corse , pale , pale as ashes , all bedaub in blood , all in , i swounded at the sight .
o , break , my heart !
poor bankrupt , break at once !
to prison , eyes , look on liberty !
vile earth , to earth resign , end motion here , and thou and romeo press one heavy bier !
o tybalt , tybalt , the best friend i had !
o courteous tybalt !
honest gentleman !
that ever i should live to see thee dead !
what storm is this that blows so contrary ?
is romeo slaughter , and is tybalt dead ?
my cousin , and my dearer lord ?
then , dreadful trumpet , sound the general doom !
for who is living , if those two are gone ?
tybalt is gone , and romeo banished , romeo that kill him , he is banished .
o god !
did romeo hand shed tybalt blood ?
it did , it did , alas the day , it did !
o serpent heart , hid with a flowering face !
did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?
beautiful tyrant !
fiend angelical !
raven !
lamb !
despised substance of divinest show !
just opposite to what thou justly , a damned saint , an honourable villain !
o nature , what hadst thou to do in hell , when thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend in moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?
was ever book containing such vile matter so fairly bound ?
o that deceit should dwell in such a gorgeous palace !
there no trust , no faith , no honesty in men , all perjured , all forsworn , all naught , all dissemblers .
ah , where my man ?
give me some aqua vitae these griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .
shame come to romeo !
blister be thy tongue for such a wish !
he was not born to shame upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , for is a throne where honour may be crown sole monarch of the universal earth .
o , what a beast was i to chide at him !
will you speak well of him that kill your cousin ?
shall i speak ill of him that is my husband ?
ah , poor my lord , what tongue shall smooth thy name , when i , thy wife , have mangled it ?
but , wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?
that villain cousin would have kill my husband back , foolish tears , back to your native spring , your tributary drops belong to woe , which you , mistaking , offer up to joy .
my husband lives , that tybalt would have slain , and tybalt dead , that would have slain my husband all this is comfort , wherefore weep i then ?
some word there was , worser than tybalt death , that murder me i would forget it fain , but , o , it presses to my memory , like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds is dead , and romeo banished , ' that , ' that one word , ' hath slain ten thousand tybalts .
tybalt death was woe enough , if it had ended there or , if sour woe delights in fellowship and needly will be rank with other griefs , why follow not , when she said dead , ' thy father , or thy mother , nay , or both , which modern lamentations might have moved ?
but with a following tybalt death , is banished , ' to speak that word , is father , mother , tybalt , romeo , juliet , all slain , all dead .
is banished ! '
there is no end , no limit , measure , bound , in that word death , no words can that woe sound .
where is my father , and my mother , nurse ?
weeping and wailing over tybalt corse will you go to them ?
i will bring you thither .
wash they his wounds with tears mine shall be spent , when theirs are dry , for romeo banishment .
take up those cords poor ropes , you are beguiled , both you and i , for romeo is exiled he made you for a highway to my bed , but i , a maid , die .
come , cords , come , nurse , i to my , and death , not romeo , take my maidenhead !
hie to your chamber i find romeo to comfort you i wot well where he is .
hark ye , your romeo will be here at night i to him , he is hid at laurence ' cell .
o , find him !
give this ring to my true knight , and bid him come to take his last farewell .
exeunt scene iii .
friar laurence cell .
enter friar laurence romeo , come forth , come forth , thou fearful man affliction is enamour of thy parts , and thou art wedded to calamity .
enter romeo father , what news ?
what is the prince doom ?
what sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand , that i yet know not ?
too familiar is my dear son with such sour company i bring thee tidings of the prince doom .
what less than is the prince doom ?
a gentler judgment vanish from his lips , not body death , but body banishment .
ha , banishment !
be merciful , say , ' for exile hath more terror in his look , much more than death do not say . '
hence from verona art thou banished be patient , for the world is broad and wide .
there is no world without verona walls , but purgatory , torture , hell itself .
is banish from the world , and world exile is death then banished , is death calling death banishment , thou my head off with a golden axe , and smilest upon the stroke that murders me .
o deadly sin !
o rude unthankfulness !
thy fault our law calls death , but the kind prince , taking thy part , hath rush aside the law , and turn that black word death to banishment this is dear mercy , and thou seest it not .
is torture , and not mercy heaven is here , where juliet lives , and every cat and dog and little mouse , every unworthy thing , live here in heaven and may look on her , but romeo may not more validity , more honourable state , more courtship lives in than romeo they my seize on the white wonder of dear juliet hand and steal immortal blessing from her lips , who even in pure and vestal modesty , still blush , as thinking their own kisses sin , but romeo may not , he is banished flies may do this , but i from this must fly they are free men , but i am banished .
and thou yet that exile is not death ?
hadst thou no poison mix , no knife , no sudden mean of death , though so mean , but ' to kill me ? ' ?
o friar , the damned use that word in hell , howlings attend it how hast thou the heart , being a divine , a ghostly confessor , a , and my friend profess , to mangle me with that word ' ?
thou fond mad man , hear me but speak a word .
o , thou wilt speak again of banishment .
i give thee armour to keep off that word adversity sweet milk , philosophy , to comfort thee , though thou art banished .
yet ' ?
hang up philosophy !
unless philosophy can make a juliet , displant a town , reverse a prince doom , it helps not , it prevails not talk no more .
o , then i see that madmen have no ears .
how should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?
let me dispute with thee of thy estate .
thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel wert thou as young as i , juliet thy love , an hour but married , tybalt murdered , doting like me and like me banished , then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair , and fall upon the ground , as i do now , taking the measure of an unmade grave .
knocking within arise , one knocks , good romeo , hide thyself .
not i , unless the breath of heartsick groans , , infold me from the search of eyes .
knocking hark , how they knock !
who there ?
romeo , arise , thou wilt be taken .
stay awhile !
stand up , knocking run to my study .
by and by !
god will , what simpleness is this !
i come , i come !
knocking who knocks so hard ?
whence come you ?
what your will ?
within let me come in , and you shall know my errand , i come from lady juliet .
welcome , then .
enter nurse o holy friar , o , tell me , holy friar , where is my lady lord , where romeo ?
there on the ground , with his own tears made drunk .
o , he is even in my mistress ' case , just in her case !
o woful sympathy !
piteous predicament !
even so lies she , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .
stand up , stand up , stand , and you be a man for juliet sake , for her sake , rise and stand , why should you fall into so deep an o ?
nurse !
ah sir !
ah sir !
well , death the end of all .
spakest thou of juliet ?
how is it with her ?
doth she not think me an old murderer , now i have stain the childhood of our joy with blood removed but little from her own ?
where is she ?
and how doth she ?
and what says my conceal lady to our cancell love ?
o , she says nothing , sir , but weeps and weeps , and now falls on her bed , and then starts up , and tybalt calls , and then on romeo cries , and then down falls again .
as if that name , shot from the deadly level of a gun , did murder her , as that name cursed hand murder her kinsman .
o , tell me , friar , tell me , in what vile part of this anatomy doth my name lodge ?
tell me , that i may sack the hateful mansion .
drawing his sword hold thy desperate hand art thou a man ?
thy form cries out thou art thy tears are womanish , thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast unseemly woman in a seeming man !
or beast in seeming both !
thou hast amazed me by my holy order , i thought thy disposition better temper .
hast thou slain tybalt ?
wilt thou slay thyself ?
and stay thy lady too that lives in thee , by doing damned hate upon thyself ?
why thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?
since birth , and heaven , and earth , all three do meet in thee at once , which thou at once wouldst lose .
fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , which , like a usurer , in all , and usest none in that true use indeed which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit thy noble shape is but a form of wax , digressing from the valour of a man , thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury , killing that love which thou hast vow to cherish , thy wit , that ornament to shape and love , misshapen in the conduct of them both , like powder in a skitless soldier flask , is set afire by thine own ignorance , and thou dismember with thine own defence .
what , rouse thee , man !
thy juliet is alive , for whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , there art thou happy tybalt would kill thee , but thou tybalt , there are thou happy too the law that threaten death becomes thy friend and turns it to exile , there art thou happy a pack of blessings lights up upon thy back , happiness courts thee in her best array , but , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , thou upon thy fortune and thy love take heed , take heed , for such die miserable .
go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed , ascend her chamber , hence and comfort her but look thou stay not till the watch be set , for then thou canst not pass to mantua , where thou shalt live , till we can find a time to blaze your marriage , reconcile your friends , beg pardon of the prince , and call thee back with twenty hundred thousand times more joy than thou forth in lamentation .
go before , nurse commend me to thy lady , and bid her hasten all the house to bed , which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto romeo is coming .
o lord , i could have stay here all the night to hear good counsel o , what learning is !
my lord , i tell my lady you will come .
do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .
here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .
exit how well my comfort is revived by this !
go hence , good night , and here stands all your state either be gone before the watch be set , or by the break of day disguised from hence sojourn in mantua , i find out your man , and he shall signify from time to time every good hap to you that chances here give me thy hand , is late farewell , good night .
but that a joy past joy calls out on me , it were a grief , so brief to part with thee farewell .

good night .
exeunt scene capulet orchard .
enter romeo and juliet above , at the window wilt thou be gone ?
it is not yet near day it was the nightingale , and not the lark , that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear , nightly she sings on yon believe me , love , it was the nightingale .
it was the lark , the herald of the morn , no nightingale look , love , what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east night candles are burnt out , and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .
i must be gone and live , or stay and die .
yon light is not , i know it , i it is some meteor that the sun exhales , to be to thee this night a , and light thee on thy way to mantua therefore stay yet , thou not to be gone .
let me be , let me be put to death , i am content , so thou wilt have it so .
i say yon grey is not the morning eye , is but the pale reflex of cynthia brow , nor that is not the lark , whose notes do beat the vaulty heaven so high above our heads i have more care to stay than will to go come , death , and welcome !
juliet wills it so .
how , my soul ?
let talk , it is not day .
it is , it is hie hence , be gone , away !
it is the lark that sings so out of tune , straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .
some say the lark makes sweet division , this doth not so , for she divideth us some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes , o , now i would they had changed voices too !
since arm from arm that voice doth us affray , hunting thee hence with to the day , o , now be gone , more light and light it grows .
more light and light , more dark and dark our woes !
enter nurse , to the chamber madam !
nurse ?
your lady mother is coming to your chamber the day is broke , be wary , look about .
exit then , window , let day in , and let life out .
farewell , farewell !
one kiss , and i descend .
he goeth down art thou gone so ?
love , lord , ay , husband , friend !
i must hear from thee every day in the hour , for in a minute there are many days o , by this count i shall be much in years ere i again behold my romeo !
farewell !
i will omit no opportunity that may convey my greetings , love , to thee .
o thou we shall ever meet again ?
i doubt it not , and all these woes shall serve for sweet discourses in our time to come .
o god , i have an soul !
methinks i see thee , now thou art below , as one dead in the bottom of a tomb either my eyesight fails , or thou pale .
and trust me , love , in my eye so do you dry sorrow drinks our blood .
adieu , adieu !
exit o fortune , fortune !
all men call thee fickle if thou art fickle , what dost thou with him .
that is renown for faith ?
be fickle , fortune , for then , i hope , thou wilt not keep him long , but send him back .
within ho , daughter !
are you up ?
who that calls ?
is it my lady mother ?
is she not down so late , or up so early ?
what unaccustom cause procures her hither ?
enter lady capulet why , how now , juliet !
madam , i am not well .
evermore weeping for your cousin death ?
what , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?
an if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live , therefore , have done some grief shows much of love , but much of grief shows still some want of wit .
yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .
so shall you feel the loss , but not the friend which you weep for .
feeling so the loss , can not choose but ever weep the friend .
well , girl , thou not so much for his death , as that the villain lives which slaughter him .
what villain madam ?
that same villain , romeo .
aside villain and he be many miles god pardon him !
i do , with all my heart , and yet no man like he doth grieve my heart .
that is , because the traitor murderer lives .
ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands would none but i might venge my cousin death !
we will have vengeance for it , fear thou not then weep no more .
i send to one in mantua , where that same banish runagate doth live , shall give him such an unaccustom dram , that he shall soon keep tybalt company and then , i hope , thou wilt be satisfied .
indeed , i never shall be satisfied with romeo , till i behold him dead is my poor heart for a kinsman vex .
madam , if you could find out but a man to bear a poison , i would temper it , that romeo should , upon receipt thereof , soon sleep in quiet .
o , how my heart abhors to hear him named , and can not come to him .
to wreak the love i bore my cousin upon his body that slaughter him !
find thou the means , and i find such a man .
but now i tell thee joyful tidings , girl .
and joy comes well in such a needy time what are they , i beseech your ladyship ?
well , well , thou hast a careful father , child , one who , to put thee from thy heaviness , hath sorted out a sudden day of joy , that thou not nor i look not for .
madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
marry , my child , early next thursday morn , the gallant , young and noble gentleman , the county paris , at saint peter church , shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .
now , by saint peter church and peter too , he shall not make me there a joyful bride .
i wonder at this haste , that i must wed ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .
i pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , i will not marry yet , and , when i do , i swear , it shall be romeo , whom you know i hate , rather than paris .
these are news indeed !
here comes your father , tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
enter capulet and nurse when the sun sets , the air doth drizzle dew , but for the sunset of my brother son it rains downright .
how now !
a conduit , girl ?
what , still in tears ?
evermore showering ?
in one little body thou a bark , a sea , a wind , for still thy eyes , which i may call the sea , do ebb and flow with tears , the bark thy body is , sailing in this salt flood , the winds , thy sighs , who , raging with thy tears , and they with them , without a sudden calm , will overset thy body .
how now , wife !
have you deliver to her our decree ?
ay , sir , but she will none , she gives you thanks .
i would the fool were married to her grave !
soft !
take me with you , take me with you , wife .
how !
will she none ?
doth she not give us thanks ?
is she not proud ?
doth she not count her blest , unworthy as she is , that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom ?
not proud , you have , but thankful , that you have proud can i never be of what i hate , but thankful even for hate , that is meant love .
how now , how now , !
what is this ?
, ' and ' i thank you , ' and ' i thank you not , ' and yet proud , ' mistress minion , you , thank me no thankings , nor , proud me no prouds , but fettle your fine joints thursday next , to go with paris to saint peter church , or i will drag thee on a hurdle thither .
out , you carrion !
out , you baggage !

fie , fie !
what , are you mad ?
good father , i beseech you on my knees , hear me with patience but to speak a word .
hang thee , young baggage !
disobedient wretch !
i tell thee what get thee to church o ' thursday , or never after look me in the face speak not , reply not , do not answer me , my fingers itch .
wife , we scarce thought us blest that god had lent us but this only child , but now i see this one is one too much , and that we have a curse in having her out on her , hilding !
god in heaven bless her !
you are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .
and why , my lady wisdom ?
hold your tongue , good prudence , smatter with your gossips , go .
i speak no treason .
o , god ye .
may not one speak ?
peace , you mumbling fool !
utter your gravity a gossip bowl , for here we need it not .
you are too hot .
god bread !
it makes me mad day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , alone , in company , still my care hath been to have her match and having now provided a gentleman of noble parentage , of fair demesnes , youthful , and nobly train , stuff , as they say , with honourable parts , proportion as one thought would wish a man , and then to have a wretched puling fool , a whining mammet , in her fortune tender , to answer ' i not wed , i can not love , i am too young , i pray you , pardon me . '
but , as you will not wed , i pardon you graze where you will you shall not house with me look , think o , i do not use to jest .
thursday is near , lay hand on heart , advise an you be mine , i give you to my friend , and you be not , hang , beg , starve , die in the streets , for , by my soul , i acknowledge thee , nor what is mine shall never do thee good trust , bethink you , i not be forsworn .
exit is there no pity sitting in the clouds , that sees into the bottom of my grief ?
o , sweet my mother , cast me not away !
delay this marriage for a month , a week , or , if you do not , make the bridal bed in that dim monument where tybalt lies .
talk not to me , for i not speak a word do as thou wilt , for i have done with thee .
exit o god ! o nurse , how shall this be prevented ?
my husband is on earth , my faith in heaven , how shall that faith return again to earth , unless that husband send it me from heaven by leaving earth ?
comfort me , counsel me .
alack , alack , that heaven should practise stratagems upon so soft a subject as myself !
what thou ?
hast thou not a word of joy ?
some comfort , nurse .
faith , here it is .
romeo is banish , and all the world to nothing , that he dares come back to challenge you , or , if he do , it needs must be by stealth .
then , since the case so stands as now it doth , i think it best you married with the county .
o , he a lovely gentleman !
romeo a dishclout to him an eagle , madam , hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye as paris hath .
beshrew my very heart , i think you are happy in this second match , for it excels your first or if it did not , your first is dead , or as good he were , as living here and you no use of him .
speakest thou from thy heart ?
and from my soul too , or else beshrew them both .
amen !
what ?
well , thou hast comforted me marvellous much .
go in and tell my lady i am gone , having displeased my father , to laurence ' cell , to make confession and to be absolved .
marry , i will , and this is wisely done .
exit ancient damnation !
o most wicked fiend !
is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn , or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue which she hath praised him with above compare so many thousand times ?
go , counsellor , thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain .
i to the friar , to know his remedy if all else fail , myself have power to die .
exit act iv scene friar laurence cell .
enter friar laurence and paris on thursday , sir ?
the time is very short .
my father capulet will have it so , and i am nothing slow to slack his haste .
you say you do not know the lady mind uneven is the course , i like it not .
immoderately she weeps for tybalt death , and therefore have i little talk of love , for venus smiles not in a house of tears .
now , sir , her father counts it dangerous that she doth give her sorrow so much sway , and in his wisdom hastes our marriage , to stop the inundation of her tears , which , too much minded by herself alone , may be put from her by society now do you know the reason of this haste .
aside i would i knew not why it should be slow .
look , sir , here comes the lady towards my cell .
enter juliet happily met , my lady and my wife !
that may be , sir , when i may be a wife .
that may be must be , love , on thursday next .
what must be shall be .
that a certain text .
come you to make confession to this father ?
to answer that , i should confess to you .
do not deny to him that you love me .
i will confess to you that i love him .
so will ye , i am sure , that you love me .
if i do so , it will be of more price , being spoke behind your back , than to your face .
poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .
the tears have got small victory by that , for it was bad enough before their spite .
thou it , more than tears , with that report .
that is no slander , sir , which is a truth , and what i spake , i spake it to my face .
thy face is mine , and thou hast slander it .
it may be so , for it is not mine own .
are you at leisure , holy father , now , or shall i come to you at evening mass ?
my leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now .
my lord , we must entreat the time alone .
god shield i should disturb devotion !
juliet , on thursday early will i rouse ye till then , adieu , and keep this holy kiss .
exit o shut the door !
and when thou hast done so , come weep with me , past hope , past cure , past help !
ah , juliet , i already know thy grief , it strains me past the compass of my wits i hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , on thursday next be married to this county .
tell me not , friar , that thou of this , unless thou tell me how i may prevent it if , in thy wisdom , thou canst give no help , do thou but call my resolution wise , and with this knife i help it presently .
god join my heart and romeo , thou our hands , and ere this hand , by thee to romeo seal , shall be the label to another deed , or my true heart with treacherous revolt turn to another , this shall slay them both therefore , out of thy time , give me some present counsel , or , behold , my extremes and me this bloody knife shall play the umpire , arbitrating that which the commission of thy years and art could to no issue of true honour bring .
be not so long to speak , i long to die , if what thou speak not of remedy .
hold , daughter i do spy a kind of hope , which craves as desperate an execution .
as that is desperate which we would prevent .
if , rather than to marry county paris , thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself , then is it likely thou wilt undertake a thing like death to chide away this shame , that copest with death himself to scape from it and , if thou darest , i give thee remedy .
o , bid me leap , rather than marry paris , from off the battlements of yonder tower , or walk in thievish ways , or bid me lurk where serpents are , chain me with roaring bears , or shut me nightly in a , quite with dead men rattling bones , with reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls , or bid me go into a grave and hide me with a dead man in his shroud , things that , to hear them told , have made me tremble , and i will do it without fear or doubt , to live an unstain wife to my sweet love .
hold , then , go home , be merry , give consent to marry paris wednesday is night look that thou lie alone , let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber take thou this vial , being then in bed , and this distilled liquor drink thou off , when presently through all thy veins shall run a cold and drowsy humour , for no pulse shall keep his native progress , but surcease no warmth , no breath , shall testify thou livest , the roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade to paly ashes , thy eyes ' windows fall , like death , when he shuts up the day of life , each part , deprived of supple government , shall , stiff and stark and cold , appear like death and in this borrow likeness of shrunk death thou shalt continue two and forty hours , and then awake as from a pleasant sleep .
now , when the bridegroom in the morning comes to rouse thee from thy bed , there art thou dead then , as the manner of our country is , in thy best robes uncover on the bier thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault where all the kindred of the capulets lie .
in the mean time , against thou shalt awake , shall romeo by my letters know our drift , and hither shall he come and he and i will watch thy waking , and that very night shall romeo bear thee hence to mantua .
and this shall free thee from this present shame , if no inconstant toy , nor womanish fear , abate thy valour in the acting it .
give me , give me !
o , tell not me of fear !
hold , get you gone , be strong and prosperous in this resolve i send a friar with speed to mantua , with my letters to thy lord .
love give me strength !
and strength shall help afford .
farewell , dear father !

how if , when i am laid into the tomb , i wake before the time that romeo come to redeem me ?
there a fearful point !
shall i not , then , be stifled in the vault , to whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in , and there die strangled ere my romeo comes ?
or , if i live , is it not very like , the horrible conceit of death and night , together with the terror of the place , as in a vault , an ancient receptacle , where , for these many hundred years , the bones of all my buried ancestors are packed where bloody tybalt , yet but green in earth , lies festering in his shroud , where , as they say , at some hours in the night spirits resort , alack , alack , is it not like that i , so early waking , what with loathsome smells , and shrieks like mandrakes ' torn out of the earth , that living mortals , hearing them , run mad o , if i wake , shall i not be distraught , environed with all these hideous fears ?
and madly play with my forefather joints ?
and pluck the mangled tybalt from his shroud ?
and , in this rage , with some great kinsman bone , as with a club , dash out my desperate brains ?

enter romeo if i may trust the flattering truth of sleep , my dreams presage some joyful news at hand my bosom lord sits lightly in his throne , and all this day an unaccustom spirit lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts .
i dreamt my lady came and found me dead strange dream , that gives a dead man leave to think ! and breathed such life with kisses in my lips , that i revived , and was an emperor .
ah me !
how sweet is love itself possess , when but love shadows are so rich in joy !
enter balthasar , booted news from verona ! how now , balthasar !
dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?
how doth my lady ?
is my father well ?
how fares my juliet ?
that i ask again , for nothing can be ill , if she be well .
then she is well , and nothing can be ill her body sleeps in capel monument , and her immortal part with angels lives .
i saw her laid low in her kindred vault , and presently took post to tell it you o , pardon me for bringing these ill news , since you did leave it for my office , sir .
is it even so ?
then i defy you , stars !
thou my lodging get me ink and paper , and hire , i will hence .
i do beseech you , sir , have patience your looks are pale and wild , and do import some misadventure .
tush , thou art deceived leave me , and do the thing i bid thee do .
hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?
no , my good lord .
no matter get thee gone , and hire those horses , i be with thee straight .
exit balthasar well , juliet , i will lie with thee .
let see for means o mischief , thou art swift to enter in the thoughts of desperate men !
i do remember an apothecary , and hereabouts he dwells , which late i noted in tatter weeds , with overwhelming brows , culling of simples , meagre were his looks , sharp misery had worn him to the bones and in his needy shop a tortoise hung , an alligator stuff , and other skins of fishes , and about his shelves a beggarly account of empty boxes , green earthen pots , bladders and musty seeds , remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses , were thinly scatter , to make up a show .
noting this penury , to myself i said if a man did need a poison now , whose sale is present death in mantua , here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him . '
o , this same thought did but forerun my need , and this same needy man must sell it me .
as i remember , this should be the house .
being holiday , the beggar shop is shut .
what , ho !
apothecary !
enter apothecary who calls so loud ?
come hither , man .
i see that thou art poor hold , there is forty ducats let me have a dram of poison , such gear as will disperse itself through all the veins that the taker may fall dead and that the trunk may be discharged of breath as violently as hasty powder fired doth hurry from the fatal cannon womb .
such mortal drugs i have , but mantua law is death to any he that utters them .
art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , and to die ?
famine is in thy cheeks , need and oppression starveth in thine eyes , contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back , the world is not thy friend nor the world law , the world affords no law to make thee rich , then be not poor , but break it , and take this .
my poverty , but not my will , consents .
i pay thy poverty , and not thy will .
put this in any liquid thing you will , and drink it off , and , if you had the strength of twenty men , it would dispatch you straight .
there is thy gold , worse poison to men souls , doing more murders in this loathsome world , than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell .
i sell thee poison , thou hast sold me none .
farewell buy food , and get thyself in flesh .
come , cordial and not poison , go with me to juliet grave , for there must i use thee .

going to find a brother out one of our order , to associate me , here in this city visiting the sick , and finding him , the searchers of the town , suspecting that we both were in a house where the infectious pestilence did reign , seal up the doors , and would not let us forth , so that my speed to mantua there was stay .
who bare my letter , then , to romeo ?
i could not send it , here it is again , nor get a messenger to bring it thee , so fearful were they of infection .
unhappy fortune !
by my brotherhood , the letter was not nice but full of charge of dear import , and the neglecting it may do much danger .
friar john , go hence , get me an iron crow , and bring it straight unto my cell .
brother , i go and bring it thee .
exit now must i to the monument alone , within three hours will fair juliet wake she will beshrew me much that romeo hath had no notice of these accidents , but i will write again to mantua , and keep her at my cell till romeo come , poor living corse , closed in a dead man tomb !

hold , take this letter , early in the morning see thou deliver it to my lord and father .
give me the light upon thy life , i charge thee , thou or seest , stand all aloof , and do not interrupt me in my course .
why i descend into this bed of death , is partly to behold my lady face , but chiefly to take thence from her dead finger a precious ring , a ring that i must use in dear employment therefore hence , be gone but if thou , jealous , dost return to pry in what i further shall intend to do , by heaven , i will tear thee joint by joint and strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs the time and my intents are , more fierce and more inexorable far than empty tigers or the roaring sea .
i will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .
so shalt thou show me friendship .
take thou that live , and be prosperous and farewell , good fellow .
aside for all this same , i hide me hereabout his looks i fear , and his intents i doubt .

condemned villain , i do apprehend thee obey , and go with me , for thou must die .

i beseech thee , youth , put not another sin upon my head , by urging me to fury o , be gone !
by heaven , i love thee better than myself , for i come hither arm against myself stay not , be gone , live , and hereafter say , a madman mercy bade thee run away .
i do defy thy conjurations , and apprehend thee for a felon here .
wilt thou provoke me ?
then have at thee , boy !

forgive me , cousin !
ah , dear juliet , why art thou yet so fair ?
shall i believe that unsubstantial death is amorous , and that the lean abhorred monster keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour ?
for fear of that , i still will stay with thee , and never from this palace of dim night depart again here , here will i remain with worms that are thy , o , here will i set up my everlasting rest , and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this flesh .
eyes , look your last !

tell me , good my friend , what torch is yond , that vainly lends his light to grubs and eyeless skulls ?
as i discern , it burneth in the capel monument .
it doth so , holy sir , and there my master , one that you love .
who is it ?
romeo .
how long hath he been there ?
full half an hour .
go with me to the vault .
i dare not , sir my master knows not but i am gone hence , and fearfully did menace me with death , if i did stay to look on his intents .
stay , then , i go alone .
fear comes upon me o , much i fear some ill unlucky thing .
as i did sleep under this here , i dreamt my master and another fought , and that my master slew him .
romeo !
advances alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains the stony entrance of this sepulchre ?
what mean these masterless and gory swords to lie discolour by this place of peace ?
enters the tomb romeo !

and steep in blood ?
ah , what an unkind hour is guilty of this lamentable chance !

i do remember well where i should be , and there i am .
where is my romeo ?
noise within i hear some noise .

go , get thee hence , for i will not away .
exit friar laurence what here ?

i will kiss thy lips , haply some poison yet doth hang on them , to make die with a restorative .
kisses him thy lips are warm .
within lead , boy which way ?
yea , noise ?
then i be brief .
o happy dagger !
snatching romeo dagger this is thy sheath , stabs herself there rust , and let me die .
falls on romeo body , and dies enter watch , with the page of paris this is the place , there , where the torch doth burn .
the ground is bloody , search about the churchyard go , some of you , you find attach .
pitiful sight !
here lies the county slain , and juliet bleeding , warm , and newly dead , who here hath lain these two days buried .
go , tell the prince run to the capulets raise up the montagues some others search we see the ground whereon these woes do lie , but the true ground of all these piteous woes we can not without circumstance descry .
some of the watch , with balthasar here romeo man , we found him in the churchyard .
hold him in safety , till the prince come hither .
others of the watch , with friar laurence here is a friar , that trembles , sighs and weeps we took this mattock and this spade from him , as he was coming from this churchyard side .
a great suspicion stay the friar too .
enter the prince and attendants what misadventure is so early up , that calls our person from our morning rest ?
enter capulet , lady capulet , and others what should it be , that they so shriek abroad ?
the people in the street cry romeo , some juliet , and some paris , and all run , with open outcry toward our monument .
what fear is this which startles in our ears ?
sovereign , here lies the county paris slain , and romeo dead , and juliet , dead before , warm and new kill .
search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .
here is a friar , and slaughter romeo man , with instruments upon them , fit to open these dead men tombs .
o heavens !
o wife , look how our daughter bleeds !
this dagger hath for , lo , his house is empty on the back of montague , and it in my daughter bosom !

this sight of death is as a bell , that warns my old age to a sepulchre .
enter montague and others come , montague , for thou art early up , to see thy son and heir more early down .
alas , my liege , my wife is dead , grief of my son exile hath stopp her breath what further woe conspires against mine age ?
look , and thou shalt see .
o thou untaught !
what manners is in this ?
to press before thy father to a grave ?
seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , till we can clear these ambiguities , and know their spring , their head , their true descent , and then will i be general of your woes , and lead you even to death meantime forbear , and let mischance be slave to patience .
bring forth the parties of suspicion .
i am the greatest , able to do least , yet most suspected , as the time and place doth make against me of this direful murder , and here i stand , both to impeach and purge myself condemned and myself excused .
then say at once what thou dost know in this .
i will be brief , for my short date of breath is not so long as is a tedious tale .
romeo , there dead , was husband to that juliet , and she , there dead , that romeo faithful wife i married them , and their was tybalt , whose untimely death banish the bridegroom from the city , for whom , and not for tybalt , juliet pined .
you , to remove that siege of grief from her , betroth and would have married her perforce to county paris then comes she to me , and , with wild looks , bid me devise some mean to rid her from this second marriage , or in my cell there would she kill herself .
then gave i her , so tutor by my art , a sleeping potion , which so took effect as i intended , for it wrought on her the form of death meantime i writ to romeo , that he should hither come as this dire night , to help to take her from her borrow grave , being the time the potion force should cease .
but he which bore my letter , friar john , was stay by accident , and yesternight return my letter back .
then all alone at the prefixed hour of her waking , came i to take her from her kindred vault , meaning to keep her closely at my cell , till i conveniently could send to romeo but when i came , some minute ere the time of her awaking , here untimely lay the noble paris and true romeo dead .
she wakes , and i entreated her come forth , and bear this work of heaven with patience but then a noise did scare me from the tomb , and she , too desperate , would not go with me , but , as it seems , did violence on herself .
all this i know , and to the marriage her nurse is privy and , if aught in this miscarried by my fault , let my old life be sacrificed , some hour before his time , unto the rigour of severest law .
we still have known thee for a holy man .
where romeo man ?
what can he say in this ?
i brought my master news of juliet death , and then in post he came from mantua to this same place , to this same monument .
this letter he early bid me give his father , and threatened me with death , going in the vault , i departed not and left him there .
give me the letter , i will look on it .
where is the county page , that raised the watch ?
sirrah , what made your master in this place ?
he came with flowers to strew his lady grave , and bid me stand aloof , and so i did anon comes one with light to ope the tomb , and by and by my master drew on him , and then i ran away to call the watch .
this letter doth make good the friar words , their course of love , the tidings of her death and here he writes that he did buy a poison of a poor , and therewithal came to this vault to die , and lie with juliet .
where be these enemies ?
capulet !
montague !
see , what a scourge is laid upon your hate , that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love .
and i for winking at your discords too have lost a brace of kinsmen all are punish .
o brother montague , give me thy hand this is my daughter jointure , for no more can i demand .
but i can give thee more for i will raise her statue in pure gold , that while verona by that name is known , there shall no figure at such rate be set as that of true and faithful juliet .
as rich shall romeo by his lady lie , poor sacrifices of our enmity !
a glooming peace this morning with it brings , the sun , for sorrow , will not show his head go hence , to have more talk of these sad things , some shall be pardon , and some punished for never was a story of more woe than this of juliet and her romeo .

sirs , i will practise on this drunken man .
what think you , if he were convey to bed , wrapp in sweet clothes , rings put upon his fingers , a most delicious banquet by his bed , and brave attendants near him when he wakes , would not the beggar then forget himself ?

'
and then with kind embracements , tempting kisses , and with declining head into his bosom , bid him shed tears , as being overjoy to see her noble lord restored to health , who for this seven years hath esteem him no better than a poor and loathsome beggar and if the boy have not a woman gift to rain a shower of commanded tears , an onion will do well for such a shift , which in a napkin being close convey shall in despite enforce a watery eye .
see this dispatch with all the haste thou canst anon i give thee more instructions .
exit a servingman i know the boy will well usurp the grace , voice , gait and action of a gentlewoman i long to hear him call the drunkard husband , and how my men will stay themselves from laughter when they do homage to this simple peasant .

or daphne roaming through a thorny wood , scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds , and at that sight shall sad apollo weep , so workmanly the blood and tears are drawn .
thou art a lord , and nothing but a lord thou hast a lady far more beautiful than any woman in this waning age .

aside to cart her rather she too rough for me .
there , there , hortensio , will you any wife ?
i pray you , sir , is it your will to make a stale of me amongst these mates ?
mates , maid !
how mean you that ?
no mates for you , unless you were of gentler , milder mould .
, sir , you shall never need to fear i wis it is not half way to her heart , but if it were , doubt not her care should be to comb your noddle with a stool and paint your face and use you like a fool .
from all such devils , good lord deliver us !
and me too , good lord !
hush , master !
here some good pastime toward that wench is stark mad or wonderful froward .
but in the other silence do i see maid mild behavior and sobriety .
peace , tranio !
well said , master , mum !
and gaze your fill .
gentlemen , that i may soon make good what i have said , bianca , get you in and let it not displease thee , good bianca , for i will love thee the less , my girl .

sister , content you in my discontent .
sir , to your pleasure humbly i subscribe my books and instruments shall be my company , on them to took and practise by myself .
hark , tranio !
thou hear minerva speak .
signior baptista , will you be so strange ?
sorry am i that our good will effects bianca grief .
why will you mew her up , signior baptista , for this fiend of hell , and make her bear the penance of her tongue ?
gentlemen , content ye , i am resolved go in , bianca exit bianca and for i know she taketh most delight in music , instruments and poetry , schoolmasters will i keep within my house , fit to instruct her youth .
if you , hortensio , or signior gremio , you , know any such , prefer them hither , for to cunning men i will be very kind , and liberal to mine own children in good bringing up and so farewell .
katharina , you may stay , for i have more to commune with bianca .
exit why , and i trust i may go too , may i not ?
what , shall i be appointed hours , as though , belike , i knew not what to take and what to leave , ha ?
exit you may go to the devil dam your gifts are so good , here none will hold you .
their love is not so great , hortensio , but we may blow our nails together , and fast it fairly out our cakes dough on both sides .
farewell yet for the love i bear my sweet bianca , if i can by any means light on a fit man to teach her that wherein she delights , i will wish him to her father .
so will i , signior gremio but a word , i pray .
though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked parle , know now , upon advice , it toucheth us both , that we may yet again have access to our fair mistress and be happy rivals in bianco love , to labour and effect one thing specially .
what that , i pray ?
marry , sir , to get a husband for her sister .
a husband !
a devil .
i say , a husband .
i say , a devil .
thinkest thou , hortensio , though her father be very rich , any man is so very a fool to be married to hell ?
tush , gremio , though it pass your patience and mine to endure her loud alarums , why , man , there be good fellows in the world , an a man could light on them , would take her with all faults , and money enough .
i can not tell , but i had as lief take her dowry with this condition , to be whipped at the high cross every morning .
faith , as you say , there small choice in rotten apples .
but come , since this bar in law makes us friends , it shall be so far forth friendly maintained all by helping baptista eldest daughter to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband , and then have a fresh .
sweet bianca !
happy man be his dole !
he that runs fastest gets the ring .
how say you , signior gremio ?
i am agreed , and would i had given him the best horse in padua to begin his wooing that would thoroughly woo her , wed her and bed her and rid the house of her !
come on .
exeunt gremio and hortensio i pray , sir , tell me , is it possible that love should of a sudden take such hold ?
o tranio , till i found it to be true , i never thought it possible or likely , but see , while idly i stood looking on , i found the effect of love in idleness and now in plainness do confess to thee , that art to me as secret and as dear as anna to the queen of carthage was , tranio , i burn , i pine , i perish , tranio , if i achieve not this young modest girl .
counsel me , tranio , for i know thou canst , assist me , tranio , for i know thou wilt .
master , it is no time to chide you now , affection is not rated from the heart if love have touch you , nought remains but so , te captum quam queas minimo . '
gramercies , lad , go forward , this contents the rest will comfort , for thy counsel sound .
master , you look so longly on the maid , perhaps you mark not what the pith of all .
o yes , i saw sweet beauty in her face , such as the daughter of agenor had , that made great jove to humble him to her hand .
when with his knees he kiss the cretan strand .
saw you no more ?
mark you not how her sister began to scold and raise up such a storm that mortal ears might hardly endure the din ?
tranio , i saw her coral lips to move and with her breath she did perfume the air sacred and sweet was all i saw in her .
nay , then , is time to stir him from his trance .
i pray , awake , sir if you love the maid , bend thoughts and wits to achieve her .
thus it stands her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd that till the father rid his hands of her , master , your love must live a maid at home , and therefore has he closely mew her up , because she will not be annoy with suitors .
ah , tranio , what a cruel father he !
but art thou not advised , he took some care to get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her ?
ay , marry , am i , sir , and now is plotted .
i have it , tranio .
master , for my hand , both our inventions meet and jump in one .
tell me thine first .
you will be schoolmaster and undertake the teaching of the maid that your device .
it is may it be done ?
not possible , for who shall bear your part , and be in padua here vincentio son , keep house and ply his book , welcome his friends , visit his countrymen and banquet them ?
basta , content thee , for i have it full .
we have not yet been seen in any house , nor can we lie distinguish by our faces for man or master , then it follows thus , thou shalt be master , tranio , in my stead , keep house and port and servants as i should i will some other be , some florentine , some neapolitan , or meaner man of pisa .
is hatch and shall be so tranio , at once uncase thee , take my colour hat and cloak when biondello comes , he waits on thee , but i will charm him first to keep his tongue .
so had you need .
in brief , sir , sith it your pleasure is , and i am tied to be obedient , for so your father charged me at our parting , serviceable to my son , ' quoth he , although i think was in another sense , i am content to be lucentio , because so well i love lucentio .
tranio , be so , because lucentio loves and let me be a slave , to achieve that maid whose sudden sight hath thrall my wounded eye .
here comes the rogue .
enter biondello sirrah , where have you been ?
where have i been !
nay , how now !
where are you ?
master , has my fellow tranio stolen your clothes ?
or you stolen his ?
or both ?
pray , what the news ?
sirrah , come hither is no time to jest , and therefore frame your manners to the time .
your fellow tranio here , to save my life , puts my apparel and my countenance on , and i for my escape have put on his , for in a quarrel since i came ashore i kill a man and fear i was descried wait you on him , i charge you , as becomes , while i make way from hence to save my life you understand me ?
i , sir !
a whit .
and not a jot of tranio in your mouth tranio is changed into lucentio .
the better for him would i were so too !
so could i , faith , boy , to have the next wish after , that lucentio indeed had baptista youngest daughter .
but , sirrah , not for my sake , but your master , i advise you use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies when i am alone , why , then i am tranio , but in all places else your master lucentio .
tranio , let go one thing more rests , that thyself execute , to make one among these wooers if thou ask me why , sufficeth , my reasons are both good and weighty .
exeunt the presenters above speak my lord , you nod , you do not mind the play .
yes , by saint anne , do i .
a good matter , surely comes there any more of it ?
my lord , is but begun .
is a very excellent piece of work , madam lady would done !
they sit and mark scene ii .
padua .
before hortensio house .
enter petruchio and his man grumio verona , for a while i take my leave , to see my friends in padua , but of all my best beloved and approved friend , hortensio , and i trow this is his house .
here , sirrah grumio , knock , i say .
knock , sir !
whom should i knock ?
is there man has rebused your worship ?
villain , i say , knock me here soundly .
knock you here , sir !
why , sir , what am i , sir , that i should knock you here , sir ?
villain , i say , knock me at this gate and rap me well , or i knock your knave pate .
my master is grown quarrelsome .
i should knock you first , and then i know after who comes by the worst .
will it not be ?
faith , sirrah , an you not knock , i ring it , i try how you can sol , fa , and sing it .
he wrings him by the ears help , masters , help !
my master is mad .
now , knock when i bid you , sirrah villain !
enter hortensio how now !
what the matter ?
my old friend grumio !
and my good friend petruchio !
how do you all at verona ?
signior hortensio , come you to part the fray ?
tutto il cuore , ben trovato , ' may i say .
nostra casa ben venuto , molto honorato signor mio petruchio . '
rise , grumio , rise we will compound this quarrel .
nay , is no matter , sir , what he in latin .
if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his service , look you , sir , he bid me knock him and rap him soundly , sir well , was it fit for a servant to use his master so , being perhaps , for aught i see , two and thirty , a pip out ?
whom would to god i had well knock at first , then had not grumio come by the worst .
a senseless villain !
good hortensio , i bade the rascal knock upon your gate and could not get him for my heart to do it .
knock at the gate !
o heavens !
spake you not these words plain , , knock me here , rap me here , knock me well , and knock me soundly ' ?
and come you now with , at the gate ' ?
sirrah , be gone , or talk not , i advise you .
petruchio , patience , i am grumio pledge why , this a heavy chance him and you , your ancient , trusty , pleasant servant grumio .
and tell me now , sweet friend , what happy gale blows you to padua here from old verona ?
such wind as scatters young men through the world , to seek their fortunes farther than at home where small experience grows .
but in a few , signior hortensio , thus it stands with me antonio , my father , is deceased , and i have thrust myself into this maze , haply to wive and thrive as best i may crowns in my purse i have and goods at home , and so am come abroad to see the world .
petruchio , shall i then come roundly to thee and wish thee to a shrewd wife ?
thank me but a little for my counsel and yet i promise thee she shall be rich and very rich but too much my friend , and i not wish thee to her .
signior hortensio , such friends as we few words suffice , and therefore , if thou know one rich enough to be petruchio wife , as wealth is burden of my wooing dance , be she as foul as was florentius ' love , as old as sibyl and as curst and shrewd as socrates ' xanthippe , or a worse , she moves me not , or not removes , at least , affection edge in me , were she as rough as are the swelling adriatic seas i come to wive it wealthily in padua , if wealthily , then happily in padua .
nay , look you , sir , he tells you flatly what his mind is why give him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an , or an old trot with a tooth in her head , though she have as many diseases as two and fifty horses why , nothing comes amiss , so money comes withal .
petruchio , since we are stepp thus far in , i will continue that i broach in jest .
i can , petruchio , help thee to a wife with wealth enough and young and beauteous , brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman her only fault , and that is faults enough , is that she is intolerable curst and shrewd and froward , so beyond all measure that , were my state far worser than it is , i would not wed her for a mine of gold .
hortensio , peace !
thou not gold effect tell me her father name and is enough , for i will board her , though she chide as loud as thunder when the clouds in autumn crack .
her father is baptista minola , an affable and courteous gentleman her name is katharina minola , renown in padua for her scolding tongue .
i know her father , though i know not her , and he knew my deceased father well .
i will not sleep , hortensio , till i see her , and therefore let me be thus bold with you to give you over at this first encounter , unless you will accompany me thither .
i pray you , sir , let him go while the humour lasts .
o ' my word , an she knew him as well as i do , she would think scolding would do little good upon him she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so why , that nothing , an he begin once , he rail in his .
i tell you what sir , an she stand him but a little , he will throw a figure in her face and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat .
you know him not , sir .
tarry , petruchio , i must go with thee , for in baptista keep my treasure is he hath the jewel of my life in hold , his youngest daughter , beautiful binaca , and her withholds from me and other more , suitors to her and rivals in my love , supposing it a thing impossible , for those defects i have before rehearsed , that ever katharina will be woo , therefore this order hath baptista , that none shall have access unto bianca till katharina the curst have got a husband .
katharina the curst !
a title for a maid of all titles the worst .
now shall my friend petruchio do me grace , and offer me disguised in sober robes to old baptista as a schoolmaster well seen in music , to instruct bianca , that so i may , by this device , at least have leave and leisure to make love to her and unsuspected court her by herself .
here no knavery !
see , to beguile the old folks , how the young folks lay their heads together !
enter gremio , and lucentio disguised master , master , look about you who goes there , ha ?
peace , grumio !
it is the rival of my love .
petruchio , stand by a while .
a proper stripling and an amorous !
o , very well , i have perused the note .
hark you , sir i have them very fairly bound all books of love , see that at any hand , and see you read no other lectures to her you understand me over and beside signior baptista liberality , i mend it with a largess .
take your paper too , and let me have them very well perfumed for she is sweeter than perfume itself to whom they go to .
what will you read to her ?
i read to her , i plead for you as for my patron , stand you so assured , as firmly as yourself were still in place yea , and perhaps with more successful words than you , unless you were a scholar , sir .
o this learning , what a thing it is !
o this woodcock , what an ass it is !
peace , sirrah !
grumio , mum !
god save you , signior gremio .
and you are well met , signior hortensio .
trow you whither i am going ?
to baptista minola .
i promised to inquire carefully about a schoolmaster for the fair bianca and by good fortune i have lighted well on this young man , for learning and behavior fit for her turn , well read in poetry and other books , good ones , i warrant ye .
is well , and i have met a gentleman hath promised me to help me to another , a fine musician to instruct our mistress , so shall i no whit be behind in duty to fair bianca , so beloved of me .
beloved of me , and that my deeds shall prove .
and that his bags shall prove .
gremio , is now no time to vent our love listen to me , and if you speak me fair , i tell you news indifferent good for either .
here is a gentleman whom by chance i met , upon agreement from us to his liking , will undertake to woo curst katharina , yea , and to marry her , if her dowry please .
so said , so done , is well .
hortensio , have you told him all her faults ?
i know she is an irksome brawling scold if that be all , masters , i hear no harm .
no , me so , friend ?
what countryman ?
born in verona , old antonio son my father dead , my fortune lives for me , and i do hope good days and long to see .
o sir , such a life , with such a wife , were strange !
but if you have a stomach , i ' god name you shall have me assisting you in all .
but will you woo this ?
will i live ?
will he woo her ?
ay , or i hang her .
why came i hither but to that intent ?
think you a little din can daunt mine ears ?
have i not in my time heard lions roar ?
have i not heard the sea puff up with winds rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat ?
have i not heard great ordnance in the field , and heaven artillery thunder in the skies ?
have i not in a pitched battle heard loud , neighing steeds , and trumpets ' clang ?
and do you tell me of a woman tongue , that gives not half so great a blow to hear as will a chestnut in a farmer fire ?
tush , tush !
fear boys with bugs .
for he fears none .
hortensio , hark this gentleman is happily arrived , my mind presumes , for his own good and ours .
i promised we would be contributors and bear his charging of wooing , .
and so we will , provided that he win her .
i would i were as sure of a good dinner .

no , if without more words you will get you hence .
why , sir , i pray , are not the streets as free for me as for you ?
but so is not she .
for what reason , i beseech you ?
for this reason , if you know , that she the choice love of signior gremio .
that she the chosen of signior hortensio .

baptista is a noble gentleman , to whom my father is not all unknown , and were his daughter fairer than she is , she may more suitors have and me for one .

yea , leave that labour to great hercules , and let it be more than alcides ' twelve .
sir , understand you this of me in sooth the younges t daughter whom you hearken for her father keeps from all access of suitors , and will not promise her to any man until the elder sister first be wed the younger then is free and not before .
if it be so , sir , that you are the man must stead us all and me amongst the rest , and if you break the ice and do this feat , achieve the elder , set the younger free for our access , whose hap shall be to have her will not so graceless be to be ingrate .
sir , you say well and well you do conceive , and since you do profess to be a suitor , you must , as we do , gratify this gentleman , to whom we all rest generally beholding .
sir , i shall not be slack in sign whereof , please ye we may contrive this afternoon , and quaff carouses to our mistress ' health , and do as adversaries do in law , strive mightily , but eat and drink as friends .
o excellent motion !
fellows , let be gone .

i am a gentleman of verona , sir , that , hearing of her beauty and her wit , her affability and bashful modesty , her wondrous qualities and mild behavior , am bold to show myself a forward guest within your house , to make mine eye the witness of that report which i so oft have heard .
and , for an entrance to my entertainment , i do present you with a man of mine , presenting hortensio cunning in music and the mathematics , to instruct her fully in those sciences , whereof i know she is not ignorant accept of him , or else you do me wrong his name is licio , born in mantua .
you welcome , sir , and he , for your good sake .
but for my daughter katharina , this i know , she is not for your turn , the more my grief .
i see you do not mean to part with her , or else you like not of my company .
mistake me not , i speak but as i find .
whence are you , sir ?
what may i call your name ?
petruchio is my name , antonio son , a man well known throughout all italy .
i know him well you are welcome for his sake .
saving your tale , petruchio , i pray , let us , that are poor petitioners , speak too baccare !
you are marvellous forward .
o , pardon me , signior gremio , i would fain be doing .
i doubt it not , sir , but you will curse your wooing .
neighbour , this is a gift very grateful , i am sure of it .
to express the like kindness , myself , that have been more kindly beholding to you than any , freely give unto you this young scholar , presenting lucentio that hath been long studying at rheims , as cunning in greek , latin , and other languages , as the other in music and mathematics his name is cambio , pray , accept his service .
a thousand thanks , signior gremio .
welcome , good cambio .
to tranio but , gentle sir , methinks you walk like a stranger may i be so bold to know the cause of your coming ?
pardon me , sir , the boldness is mine own , that , being a stranger in this city here , do make myself a suitor to your daughter , unto bianca , fair and virtuous .
nor is your firm resolve unknown to me , in the preferment of the eldest sister .
this liberty is all that i request , that , upon knowledge of my parentage , i may have welcome the rest that woo and free access and favour as the rest and , toward the education of your daughters , i here bestow a simple instrument , and this small packet of greek and latin books if you accept them , then their worth is great .
lucentio is your name , of whence , i pray ?
of pisa , sir , son to vincentio .
a mighty man of pisa , by report i know him well you are very welcome , sir , take you the lute , and you the set of books , you shall go see your pupils presently .
holla , within !
enter a servant sirrah , lead these gentlemen to my daughters , and tell them both , these are their tutors bid them use them well .
exit servant , with lucentio and hortensio , biondello following we will go walk a little in the orchard , and then to dinner .
you are passing welcome , and so i pray you all to think yourselves .
signior baptista , my business asketh haste , and every day i can not come to woo .
you knew my father well , and in him me , left solely heir to all his lands and goods , which i have better rather than decreased then tell me , if i get your daughter love , what dowry shall i have with her to wife ?
after my death the one half of my lands , and in possession twenty thousand crowns .
and , for that dowry , i assure her of her widowhood , be it that she survive me , in all my lands and leases whatsoever let specialties be therefore drawn between us , that covenants may be kept on either hand .
ay , when the special thing is well obtain , that is , her love , for that is all in all .
why , that is nothing for i tell you , father , i am as peremptory as she , and where two raging fires meet together they do consume the thing that feeds their fury though little fire grows great with little wind , yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all so i to her and so she yields to me , for i am rough and woo not like a babe .
well mayst thou woo , and happy be thy speed !
but be thou arm for some unhappy words .
ay , to the proof , as mountains are for winds , that shake not , though they blow perpetually .
hortensio , with his head broke how now , my friend !
why dost thou look so pale ?
for fear , i promise you , if i look pale .
what , will my daughter prove a good musician ?
i think she sooner prove a soldier iron may hold with her , but never lutes .
why , then thou canst not break her to the lute ?
why , no , for she hath broke the lute to me .
i did but tell her she mistook her frets , and bow her hand to teach her fingering , when , with a most impatient devilish spirit , , call you these ? '
quoth she , ' i fume with them ' and , with that word , she struck me on the head , and through the instrument my pate made way , and there i stood amazed for a while , as on a pillory , looking through the lute , while she did call me rascal fiddler and twangling jack , with twenty such vile terms , as had she studied to misuse me so .
now , by the world , it is a lusty wench , i love her ten times more than i did o , how i long to have some chat with her !
well , go with me and be not so discomfited proceed in practise with my younger daughter , she apt to learn and thankful for good turns .
signior petruchio , will you go with us , or shall i send my daughter kate to you ?
i pray you do .
exeunt all but petruchio i will attend her here , and woo her with some spirit when she comes .
say that she rail , why then i tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale say that she frown , i say she looks as clear as morning roses newly wash with dew say she be mute and will not speak a word , then i commend her volubility , and say she uttereth piercing eloquence if she do bid me pack , i give her thanks , as though she bid me stay by her a week if she deny to wed , i crave the day when i shall ask the banns and when be married .
but here she comes , and now , petruchio , speak .
enter katharina good morrow , kate , for that your name , i hear .
well have you heard , but something hard of hearing they call me katharina that do talk of me .
you lie , in faith , for you are call plain kate , and bonny kate and sometimes kate the curst , but kate , the prettiest kate in christendom kate of kate hall , my kate , for dainties are all kates , and therefore , kate , take this of me , kate of my consolation , hearing thy mildness praised in every town , thy virtues spoke of , and thy beauty sounded , yet not so deeply as to thee belongs , myself am moved to woo thee for my wife .
moved !
in good time let him that moved you hither remove you hence i knew you at the first you were a moveable .
why , what a moveable ?
a .
thou hast hit it come , sit on me .
asses are made to bear , and so are you .
women are made to bear , and so are you .
no such jade as you , if me you mean .
alas !
good kate , i will not burden thee , for , knowing thee to be but young and light too light for such a swain as you to catch , and yet as heavy as my weight should be .
should be !
should buzz !
well , and like a buzzard .
o turtle !
shall a buzzard take thee ?
ay , for a turtle , as he takes a buzzard .
come , come , you wasp , i ' faith , you are too angry .
if i be waspish , best beware my sting .
my remedy is then , to pluck it out .
ay , if the fool could find it where it lies , who knows not where a wasp does wear his sting ?
in his tail .
in his tongue .
whose tongue ?
yours , if you talk of tails and so farewell .
what , with my tongue in your tail ?
nay , come again , good kate , i am a gentleman .
that i try .
she strikes him i swear i cuff you , if you strike again .
so may you lose your arms if you strike me , you are no gentleman , and if no gentleman , why then no arms .
a herald , kate ?
o , put me in thy books !
what is your crest ?
a coxcomb ?
a combless cock , so kate will be my hen .
no cock of mine , you crow too like a craven .
nay , come , kate , come , you must not look so sour .
it is my fashion , when i see a crab .
why , here no crab , and therefore look not sour .
there is , there is .
then show it me .
had i a glass , i would .
what , you mean my face ?
well aim of such a young one .
now , by saint george , i am too young for you .
yet you are wither .
is with cares .
i care not .
nay , hear you , kate in sooth you scape not so .
i chafe you , if i tarry let me go .
no , not a whit i find you passing gentle .
was told me you were rough and coy and sullen , and now i find report a very liar , for thou are pleasant , gamesome , passing courteous , but slow in speech , yet sweet as flowers thou canst not frown , thou canst not look askance , nor bite the lip , as angry wenches will , nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk , but thou with mildness thy wooers , with gentle conference , soft and affable .
why does the world report that kate doth limp ?
o slanderous world !
kate like the is straight and slender and as brown in hue as hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels .
