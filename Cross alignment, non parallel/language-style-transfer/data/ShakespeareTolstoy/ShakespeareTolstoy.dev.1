darya alexandrovna was firmly convinced of anna s innocence , and she felt herself growing pale and her lips quivering with anger at this frigid , unfeeling man , who was so calmly intending to ruin her innocent friend .
alexey alexandrovitch , she said , with desperate resolution looking him in the face , i asked you about anna , you made me no answer .
how is she ?
she is , i believe , quite well , darya alexandrovna , replied alexey alexandrovitch , not looking at her .
alexey alexandrovitch , forgive me , i have no right but i love anna as a sister , and esteem her ; i beg , i beseech you to tell me what is wrong between you ?
what fault do you find with her ?
alexey alexandrovitch frowned , and almost closing his eyes , dropped his head .
i presume that your husband has told you the grounds on which i consider it necessary to change my attitude to anna arkadyevna ?
he said , not looking her in the face , but eyeing with displeasure shtcherbatsky , who was walking across the drawing room .
i don t believe it , i don t believe it , i can t believe it !
dolly said , clasping her bony hands before her with a vigorous gesture .
she rose quickly , and laid her hand on alexey alexandrovitch s sleeve .
we shall be disturbed here .
come this way , please .
dolly s agitation had an effect on alexey alexandrovitch .
he got up and submissively followed her to the schoolroom .
they sat down to a table covered with an oilcloth cut in slits by penknives .
i don t , i don t believe it !
dolly said , trying to catch his glance that avoided her .
one can not disbelieve facts , darya alexandrovna , said he , with an emphasis on the word facts .
but what has she done ?
said darya alexandrovna .
what precisely has she done ?
she has forsaken her duty , and deceived her husband .
that s what she has done , said he .
no , no , it can t be !
no , for god s sake , you are mistaken , said dolly , putting her hands to her temples and closing her eyes .
alexey alexandrovitch smiled coldly , with his lips alone , meaning to signify to her and to himself the firmness of his conviction ; but this warm defense , though it could not shake him , reopened his wound .
he began to speak with greater heat .
it is extremely difficult to be mistaken when a wife herself informs her husband of the him that eight years of her life , and a son , all that s a mistake , and that she wants to begin life again , he said angrily , with a snort .
anna and can not connect them , i can not believe it !
darya alexandrovna , he said , now looking straight into dolly s kindly , troubled face , and feeling that his tongue was being loosened in spite of himself , i would give a great deal for doubt to be still possible .
when i doubted , i was miserable , but it was better than now .
when i doubted , i had hope ; but now there is no hope , and still i doubt of everything .
i am in such doubt of everything that i even hate my son , and sometimes do not believe he is my son .
i am very unhappy .
he had no need to say that .
darya alexandrovna had seen that as soon as he glanced into her face ; and she felt sorry for him , and her faith in the innocence of her friend began to totter .
oh , this is awful , awful !
but can it be true that you are resolved on a divorce ?
i am resolved on extreme measures .
there is nothing else for me to do .
nothing else to do , nothing else to do she replied , with tears in her eyes .
oh no , don t say nothing else to do !
she said .
what is horrible in a trouble of this kind is that one can not , as in any loss , in one s trouble in peace , but that one must act , said he , as though guessing her thought .
one must get out of the humiliating position in which one is placed ; one can t live .
i understand , i quite understand that , said dolly , and her head sank .
she was silent for a little , thinking of herself , of her own grief in her family , and all at once , with an impulsive movement , she raised her head and clasped her hands with an imploring gesture .
but wait a little !
you are a christian .
think of her !
what will become of her , if you cast her off ?
i have thought , darya alexandrovna , i have thought a great deal , said alexey alexandrovitch .
his face turned red in patches , and his dim eyes looked straight before him .
darya alexandrovna at that moment pitied him with all her heart .
that was what i did indeed when she herself made known to me my humiliation ; i left everything as of old .
i gave her a chance to reform , i tried to save her .
and with what result ?
she would not regard the slightest she should observe decorum , he said , getting heated .
one may save anyone who does not want to be ruined ; but if the whole nature is so corrupt , so depraved , that ruin itself seems to be her salvation , what s to be done ?
anything , only not divorce !
answered darya alexandrovna but what is anything ?
no , it is awful !
she will be no one s wife , she will be lost !
what can i do ?
said alexey alexandrovitch , raising his shoulders and his eyebrows .
the recollection of his wife s last act had so incensed him that he had become frigid , as at the beginning of the conversation .
i am very grateful for your sympathy , but i must be going , he said , getting up .
no , wait a minute .
you must not ruin her .
wait a little ; i will tell you about myself .
i was married , and my husband deceived me ; in anger and jealousy , i would have thrown up everything , i would myself
but i came to myself again ; and who did it ?
anna saved me .
and here i am living on .
the children are growing up , my husband has come back to his family , and feels his fault , is growing purer , better , and i live on
i have forgiven it , and you ought to forgive !
alexey alexandrovitch heard her , but her words had no effect on him now .
all the hatred of that day when he had resolved on a divorce had sprung up again in his soul .
he shook himself , and said in a shrill , loud voice forgive i can not , and do not wish to , and i regard it as wrong .
i have done everything for this woman , and she has trodden it all in the mud to which she is akin .
i am not a spiteful man , i have never hated anyone , but i hate her with my whole soul , and i can not even forgive her , because i hate her too much for all the wrong she has done me !
he said , with tones of hatred in his voice .
love those that hate you darya alexandrovna whispered timorously .
alexey alexandrovitch smiled contemptuously .
that he knew long ago , but it could not be applied to his case .
love those that hate you , but to love those one hates is impossible .
forgive me for having troubled you .
everyone has enough to bear in his own grief !
and regaining his , alexey alexandrovitch quietly took leave and went away .
when they rose from table , levin would have liked to follow kitty into the drawing room ; but he was afraid she might dislike this , as too obviously paying her attention .
he remained in the little ring of men , taking part in the general conversation , and without looking at kitty , he was aware of her movements , her looks , and the place where she was in the drawing room .
he did at once , and without the smallest effort , keep the promise he had made to think well of all men , and to like everyone always .
the conversation fell on the village commune , in which pestsov saw a sort of special principle , called by him the choral principle .
levin did not agree with pestsov , nor with his brother , who had a special attitude of his own , both admitting and not admitting the significance of the russian commune .
but he talked to them , simply trying to reconcile and soften their differences .
he was not in the least interested in what he said himself , and even less so in what they said ; all he wanted was that they and everyone should be happy and contented .
he knew now the one thing of importance ; and that one thing was at first there , in the drawing room , and then began moving across and came to a standstill at the door .
without turning round he felt the eyes fixed on him , and the smile , and he could not help turning round .
she was standing in the doorway with shtcherbatsky , looking at him .
i thought you were going towards the piano , said he , going up to her .
that s something i miss in the .
no ; we only came to fetch you and thank you , she said , rewarding him with a smile that was like a gift , for coming .
what do they want to argue for ?
no one ever convinces anyone , you know .
yes ; that s true , said levin ; it generally happens that one argues warmly simply because one can t make out what one s opponent wants to prove .
levin had often noticed in discussions between the most intelligent people that after enormous efforts , and an enormous expenditure of logical subtleties and words , the disputants finally arrived at being aware that what they had so long been struggling to prove to one another had long ago , from the beginning of the argument , been known to both , but that they liked different things , and would not define what they liked for fear of its being attacked .
he had often had the experience of suddenly in a discussion grasping what it was his opponent liked and at once liking it too , and immediately he found himself agreeing , and then all arguments fell away as useless .
sometimes , too , he had experienced the opposite , expressing at last what he liked himself , which he was devising arguments to defend , and , chancing to express it well and genuinely , he had found his opponent at once agreeing and ceasing to dispute his position .
he tried to say this .
she knitted her brow , trying to understand .
but directly he began to illustrate his meaning , she understood at once .
i know one must find out what he is arguing for , what is precious to him , then one can she had completely guessed and expressed his badly expressed idea .
levin smiled joyfully ; he was struck by this transition from the confused , verbose discussion with pestsov and his brother to this laconic , clear , almost wordless communication of the most complex ideas .
shtcherbatsky moved away from them , and kitty , going up to a card table , sat down , and , taking up the chalk , began drawing diverging circles over the new green cloth .
they began again on the subject that had been started at liberty and occupations of women .
levin was of the opinion of darya alexandrovna that a girl who did not marry should find a woman s duties in a family .
he supported this view by the fact that no family can get on without women to help ; that in every family , poor or rich , there are and must be nurses , either relations or hired .
no , said kitty , blushing , but looking at him all the more boldly with her truthful eyes ; a girl may be so circumstanced that she can not live in the family without humiliation , while she herself at the hint he understood her .
oh , yes , he said .
yes , yes , re right ; you re right !
and he saw all that pestsov had been maintaining at dinner of the liberty of woman , simply from getting a glimpse of the terror of an old maid s existence and its humiliation in kitty s heart ; and loving her , he felt that terror and humiliation , and at once gave up his arguments .
a silence followed .
she was still drawing with the chalk on the table .
her eyes were shining with a soft light .
under the influence of her mood he felt in all his being a continually growing tension of happiness .
ah !
i ve scribbled all over the table !
she said , and , laying down the chalk , she made a movement as though to get up .
what !
shall i be left her ?
he thought with horror , and he took the chalk .
wait a minute , he said , sitting down to the table .
i ve long wanted to ask you one thing .
he looked straight into her caressing , though frightened eyes .
please , ask it .
here , he said ; and he wrote the initial letters , , y , t , m , i , c , n , b , d , t , m , n , o , .
these letters meant , when you told me it could never be , did that mean never , or then ?
there seemed no likelihood that she could make out this complicated sentence ; but he looked at her as though his life depended on her understanding the words .
she glanced at him seriously , then leaned her puckered brow on her hands and began to read .
once or twice she stole a look at him , as though asking him , is it what i think ?
i understand , she said , flushing a little .
what is this word ?
he said , pointing to the n that stood for .
it means , she said ; but that s not true !
he quickly rubbed out what he had written , gave her the chalk , and stood up .
she wrote , , i , c , n , a , .
dolly was completely comforted in the depression caused by her conversation with alexey alexandrovitch when she caught sight of the two figures kitty with the chalk in her hand , with a shy and happy smile looking upwards at levin , and his handsome figure bending over the table with glowing eyes fastened one minute on the table and the next on her .
he was suddenly radiant he had understood .
it meant , then i could not answer differently .
he glanced at her questioningly , timidly .
only then ?
yes , her smile answered .
and n and now ?
he asked .
well , read this .
i ll tell you what i should like so much !
she wrote the initial letters , i , y , c , f , a , f , w , this meant , if you could forget and forgive what happened .
he snatched the chalk with nervous , trembling fingers , and breaking it , wrote the initial letters of the following phrase , i have nothing to forget and to forgive ; i have never ceased to love you .
she glanced at him with a smile that did not waver .
i understand , she said in a whisper .
he sat down and wrote a long phrase .
she understood it all , and without asking him , is it this ?
took the chalk and at once answered .
for a long while he could not understand what she had written , and often looked into her eyes .
he was stupefied with happiness .
he could not supply the word she had meant ; but in her charming eyes , beaming with happiness , he saw all he needed to know .
and he wrote three letters .
but he had hardly finished writing when she read them over her arm , and herself finished and wrote the answer , yes .
you re playing ?
said the old prince .
but we must really be getting along if you want to be in time at the theater .
levin got up and escorted kitty to the door .
in their conversation everything had been said ; it had been said that she loved him , and that she would tell her father and mother that he would come tomorrow morning .
when kitty had gone and levin was left alone , he felt such uneasiness without her , and such an impatient longing to get as quickly , as quickly as possible , to tomorrow morning , when he would see her again and be plighted to her forever , that he felt afraid , as though of death , of those fourteen hours that he had to get through without her .
it was essential for him to be with someone to talk to , so as not to be left alone , to kill time .
stepan arkadyevitch would have been the companion most congenial to him , but he was going out , he said , to a , in reality to the ballet .
levin only had time to tell him he was happy , and that he loved him , and would never , never forget what he had done for him .
the eyes and the smile of stepan arkadyevitch showed levin that he comprehended that feeling fittingly .
oh , so it s not time to die yet ?
said stepan arkadyevitch , pressing levin s hand with emotion .
!
said levin .
darya alexandrovna too , as she said to him , gave him a sort of congratulation , saying , how glad i am you have met kitty again !
one must value old friends .
levin did not like these words of darya alexandrovna s .
she could not understand how lofty and beyond her it all was , and she ought not to have dared to allude to it .
levin said to them , but , not to be left alone , he attached himself to his brother .
where are you going ?
i m going to a meeting .
well , i ll come with you .
may i ?
what for ?
yes , come along , said sergey ivanovitch , smiling .
what is the matter with you today ?
with me ?
happiness is the matter with me !
said levin , letting down the window of the carriage they were driving in .
you don t mind ? s so stifling .
it s happiness is the matter with me !
why is it you have never married ?
sergey ivanovitch smiled .
i am very glad , she seems a nice gi sergey ivanovitch was beginning .
don t say it !
don t say it !
shouted levin , clutching at the collar of his fur coat with both hands , and muffling him up in it .
she s a nice girl were such simple , humble words , so out of harmony with his feeling .
sergey ivanovitch laughed outright a merry laugh , which was rare with him .
well , anyway , i may say that i m very glad of it .
that you may do tomorrow , tomorrow and nothing more !
nothing , nothing , silence , said levin , and muffling him once more in his fur coat , he added i do like you so !
well , is it possible for me to be present at the meeting ?
of course it is .
what is your discussion about today ?
asked levin , never ceasing smiling .
they arrived at the meeting .
levin heard the secretary hesitatingly read the minutes which he obviously did not himself understand ; but levin saw from this secretary s face what a good , nice , person he was .
this was evident from his confusion and embarrassment in reading the minutes .
then the discussion began .
they were disputing about the misappropriation of certain sums and the laying of certain pipes , and sergey ivanovitch was very cutting to two members , and said something at great length with an air of triumph ; and another member , scribbling something on a bit of paper , began timidly at first , but afterwards answered him very viciously and delightfully .
and then sviazhsky ( he was there too ) said something too , very handsomely and nobly .
levin listened to them , and saw clearly that these missing sums and these pipes were not anything real , and that they were not at all angry , but were all the nicest , kindest people , and everything was as happy and charming as possible among them .
they did no harm to anyone , and were all enjoying it .
what struck levin was that he could see through them all today , and from little , almost imperceptible signs knew the soul of each , and saw distinctly that they were all good at heart .
and levin himself in particular they were all extremely fond of that day .
that was evident from the way they spoke to him , from the friendly , affectionate way even those he did not know looked at him .
well , did you like it ?
sergey ivanovitch asked him .
very much .
i never supposed it was so interesting !
capital !
splendid !
sviazhsky went up to levin and invited him to come round to tea with him .
levin was utterly at a loss to comprehend or recall what it was he had disliked in sviazhsky , what he had failed to find in him .
he was a clever and wonderfully man .
most delighted , he said , and asked after his wife and .
and from a queer association of ideas , because in his imagination the idea of sviazhsky s was connected with marriage , it occurred to him that there was no one to whom he could more suitably speak of his happiness , and he was very glad to go and see them .
sviazhsky questioned him about his improvements on his estate , presupposing , as he always did , that there was no possibility of doing anything not done already in europe , and now this did not in the least annoy levin .
on the contrary , he felt that sviazhsky was right , that the whole business was of little value , and he saw the wonderful softness and consideration with which sviazhsky avoided fully expressing his correct view .
the ladies of the sviazhsky household were particularly delightful .
it seemed to levin that they knew all about it already and sympathized with him , saying nothing merely from delicacy .
he stayed with them one hour , two , three , talking of all sorts of subjects but the one thing that filled his heart , and did not observe that he was boring them dreadfully , and that it was long past their bedtime .
sviazhsky went with him into the hall , yawning and wondering at the strange humor his friend was in .
it was past one o clock .
levin went back to his hotel , and was dismayed at the thought that all alone now with his impatience he had ten hours still left to get through .
the servant , whose turn it was to be up all night , lighted his candles , and would have gone away , but levin stopped him .
this servant , yegor , whom levin had noticed before , struck him as a very intelligent , excellent , and , above all , man .
well , yegor , it s hard work not sleeping , isn t it ?
one s got to put up with it !
it s part of our work , you see .
in a gentleman s house it s easier ; but then here one makes more .
it appeared that yegor had a family , three boys and a daughter , a sempstress , whom he wanted to marry to a cashier in a saddler s shop .
levin , on hearing this , informed yegor that , in his opinion , in marriage the great thing was love , and that with love one would always be happy , for happiness rests only on oneself .
yegor listened attentively , and obviously quite took in levin s idea , but by way of assent to it he enunciated , greatly to levin s surprise , the observation that when he had lived with good masters he had always been satisfied with his masters , and now was perfectly satisfied with his employer , though he was a frenchman .
wonderfully fellow !
thought levin .
well , but you yourself , yegor , when you got married , did you love your wife ?
ay !
and why not ?
responded yegor .
and levin saw that yegor too was in an excited state and intending to express all his most heartfelt emotions .
my life , too , has been a wonderful one .
from a child up he was beginning with flashing eyes , apparently catching levin s enthusiasm , just as people catch yawning .
but at that moment a ring was heard .
yegor departed , and levin was left alone .
he had eaten scarcely anything at dinner , had refused tea and supper at sviazhsky s , but he was incapable of thinking of supper .
he had not slept the previous night , but was incapable of thinking of sleep either .
his room was cold , but he was oppressed by heat .
he opened both the movable panes in his window and sat down to the table opposite the open panes .
over the roofs could be seen a decorated cross with chains , and above it the rising triangle of charles s wain with the yellowish light of capella .
he gazed at the cross , then at the stars , drank in the fresh freezing air that flowed evenly into the room , and followed as though in a dream the images and memories that rose in his imagination .
at four o clock he heard steps in the passage and peeped out at the door .
it was the gambler myaskin , whom he knew , coming from the club .
he walked gloomily , frowning and coughing .
poor , unlucky fellow !
thought levin , and tears came into his eyes from love and pity for this man .
he would have talked with him , and tried to comfort him , but remembering that he had nothing but his shirt on , he changed his mind and sat down again at the open pane to bathe in the cold air and gaze at the exquisite lines of the cross , silent , but full of meaning for him , and the mounting lurid yellow star .
at seven o clock there was a noise of people polishing the floors , and bells ringing in some servants department , and levin felt that he was beginning to get frozen .
he closed the pane , washed , dressed , and went out into the street .
the streets were still empty .
levin went to the house of the shtcherbatskys .
the visitors doors were closed and everything was asleep .
he walked back , went into his room again , and asked for coffee .
the day servant , not yegor this time , brought it to him .
levin would have entered into conversation with him , but a bell rang for the servant , and he went out .
levin tried to drink coffee and put some roll in his mouth , but his mouth was quite at a loss what to do with the roll .
levin , rejecting the roll , put on his coat and went out again for a walk .
it was nine o clock when he reached the shtcherbatskys steps the second time .
in the house they were only just up , and the cook came out to go marketing .
he had to get through at least two hours more .
all that night and morning levin lived perfectly unconsciously , and felt perfectly lifted out of the conditions of material life .
he had eaten nothing for a whole day , he had not slept for two nights , had spent several hours undressed in the frozen air , and felt not simply fresher and stronger than ever , but felt utterly independent of his body ; he moved without muscular effort , and felt as if he could do anything .
he was convinced he could fly upwards or lift the corner of the house , if need be .
he spent the remainder of the time in the street , incessantly looking at his watch and gazing about him .
and what he saw then , he never saw again after .
the children especially going to school , the bluish doves flying down from the roofs to the pavement , and the little loaves covered with flour , thrust out by an unseen hand , touched him .
those loaves , those doves , and those two boys were not earthly creatures .
it all happened at the same time a boy ran towards a dove and glanced smiling at levin ; the dove , with a whir of her wings , darted away , flashing in the sun , amid grains of snow that quivered in the air , while from a little window there came a smell of bread , and the loaves were put out .
all of this together was so extraordinarily nice that levin laughed and cried with delight .
going a long way round by gazetny place and kislovka , he went back again to the hotel , and putting his watch before him , he sat down to wait for twelve o clock .
in the next room they were talking about some sort of machines , and swindling , and coughing their morning coughs .
they did not realize that the hand was near twelve .
the hand reached it .
levin went out onto the steps .
the clearly knew all about it .
they crowded round levin with happy faces , quarreling among themselves , and offering their services .
trying not to offend the other sledge drivers , and promising to drive with them too , levin took one and told him to drive to the shtcherbatskys .
the was splendid in a white sticking out over his overcoat and into his strong , red neck .
the sledge was high and comfortable , and altogether such a one as levin never drove in after , and the horse was a good one , and tried to gallop but didn t seem to move .
the driver knew the shtcherbatskys house , and drew up at the entrance with a curve of his arm and a wo !
especially indicative of respect for his fare .
the shtcherbatskys certainly knew all about it .
this was evident from the smile in his eyes and the way he said well , it s a long while since you ve been to see us , konstantin demitrievitch !
not only he knew all about it , but he was unmistakably delighted and making efforts to conceal his joy .
looking into his kindly old eyes , levin realized even something new in his happiness .
are they up ?
pray walk in !
leave it here , said he , smiling , as levin would have come back to take his hat .
that meant something .
to whom shall i announce your honor ?
asked the footman .
the footman , though a young man , and one of the new school of footmen , a dandy , was a very , good fellow , and he too knew all about it .
the princess the prince the young princess said levin .
the first person he saw was mademoiselle linon .
she walked across the room , and her ringlets and her face were beaming .
he had only just spoken to her , when suddenly he heard the rustle of a skirt at the door , and mademoiselle linon vanished from levin s eyes , and a joyful terror came over him at the nearness of his happiness .
mademoiselle linon was in great haste , and leaving him , went out at the other door .
directly she had gone out , swift , swift light steps sounded on the parquet , and his bliss , his life , was best in himself , what he had so long sought and longed quickly , so quickly approaching him .
she did not walk , but seemed , by some unseen force , to float to him .
he saw nothing but her clear , truthful eyes , frightened by the same bliss of love that flooded his heart .
those eyes were shining nearer and nearer , blinding him with their light of love .
she stopped still close to him , touching him .
her hands rose and dropped onto his shoulders .
she had done all she had run up to him and given herself up entirely , shy and happy .
he put his arms round her and pressed his lips to her mouth that sought his kiss .
she too had not slept all night , and had been expecting him all the morning .
her mother and father had consented without demur , and were happy in her happiness .
she had been waiting for him .
she wanted to be the first to tell him her happiness and his .
she had got ready to see him alone , and had been delighted at the idea , and had been shy and ashamed , and did not know herself what she was doing .
she had heard his steps and voice , and had waited at the door for mademoiselle linon to go .
mademoiselle linon had gone away .
without thinking , without asking herself how and what , she had gone up to him , and did as she was doing .
let us go to mamma !
she said , taking him by the hand .
for a long while he could say nothing , not so much because he was afraid of desecrating the loftiness of his emotion by a word , as that every time he tried to say something , instead of words he felt that tears of happiness were welling up .
he took her hand and kissed it .
can it be true ?
he said at last in a choked voice .
i can t believe you love me , dear !
she smiled at that dear , and at the timidity with which he glanced at her .
yes !
she said significantly , deliberately .
i am so happy !
not letting go his hands , she went into the drawing room .
the princess , seeing them , breathed quickly , and immediately began to cry and then immediately began to laugh , and with a vigorous step levin had not expected , ran up to him , and hugging his head , kissed him , wetting his cheeks with her tears .
so it is all settled !
i am glad .
love her .
i am glad
kitty !
you ve not been long settling things , said the old prince , trying to seem unmoved ; but levin noticed that his eyes were wet when he turned to him .
i ve long , always wished for this !
said the prince , taking levin by the arm and drawing him towards himself .
even when this little fancied papa !
shrieked kitty , and shut his mouth with her hands .
well , i won t !
he said .
i m very , very plea oh , what a fool i am he embraced kitty , kissed her face , her hand , her face again , and made the sign of the cross over her .
and there came over levin a new feeling of love for this man , till then so little known to him , when he saw how slowly and tenderly kitty kissed his muscular hand .
the princess sat in her armchair , silent and smiling ; the prince sat down beside her .
kitty stood by her father s chair , still holding his hand .
all were silent .
the princess was the first to put everything into words , and to translate all thoughts and feelings into practical questions .
and all equally felt this strange and painful for the first minute .
when is it to be ?
we must have the benediction and announcement .
and when s the wedding to be ?
what do you think , alexander ?
here he is , said the old prince , pointing to he s the principal person in the matter .
when ?
said levin blushing .
tomorrow ; if you ask me , i should say , the benediction today and the wedding tomorrow .
come , , that s nonsense !
well , in a week .
he s quite mad .
no , why so ?
well , upon my word !
said the mother , smiling , delighted at this haste .
how about the trousseau ?
will there really be a trousseau and all that ?
levin thought with horror .
but can the trousseau and the benediction and all it spoil my happiness ?
nothing can spoil it !
he glanced at kitty , and noticed that she was not in the least , not in the very least , disturbed by the idea of the trousseau .
then it must be all right , he thought .
oh , i know nothing about it ; i only said what i should like , he said apologetically .
we ll talk it over , then .
the benediction and announcement can take place now .
that s very well .
the princess went up to her husband , kissed him , and would have gone away , but he kept her , embraced her , and , tenderly as a young lover , kissed her several times , smiling .
the old people were obviously muddled for a moment , and did not quite know whether it was they who were in love again or their daughter .
when the prince and the princess had gone , levin went up to his betrothed and took her hand .
he was now and could speak , and he had a great deal he wanted to tell her .
but he said not at all what he had to say .
how i knew it would be so !
i never hoped for it ; and yet in my heart i was always sure , he said .
i believe that it was ordained .
and i !
she said .
even when she stopped and went on again , looking at him resolutely with her truthful eyes , even when i thrust from me my happiness .
i always loved you alone , but i was carried away .
i ought to tell you can you forgive that ?
perhaps it was for the best .
you will have to forgive me so much .
i ought to tell you this was one of the things he had meant to speak about .
he had resolved from the first to tell her two he was not chaste as she was , and that he was not a believer .
it was agonizing , but he considered he ought to tell her both these facts .
no , not now , later !
he said .
very well , later , but you must certainly tell me .
i m not afraid of anything .
i want to know everything .
now it is settled .
he added settled that you ll take me whatever i may won t give me up ?
yes ?
yes , yes .
their conversation was interrupted by mademoiselle linon , who with an affected but tender smile came to congratulate her favorite pupil .
before she had gone , the servants came in with their congratulations .
then relations arrived , and there began that state of blissful absurdity from which levin did not emerge till the day after his wedding .
levin was in a continual state of awkwardness and discomfort , but the intensity of his happiness went on all the while increasing .
he felt continually that a great deal was being expected of , he did not know ; and he did everything he was told , and it all gave him happiness .
he had thought his engagement would have nothing about it like others , that the ordinary conditions of engaged couples would spoil his special happiness ; but it ended in his doing exactly as other people did , and his happiness being only increased thereby and becoming more and more special , more and more unlike anything that had ever happened .
now we shall have sweetmeats to eat , said mademoiselle levin drove off to buy sweetmeats .
well , i m very glad , said sviazhsky .
i advise you to get the bouquets from fomin s .
oh , are they wanted ?
and he drove to fomin s .
his brother offered to lend him money , as he would have so many expenses , presents to give oh , are presents wanted ?
and he galloped to foulde s .
and at the confectioner s , and at fomin s , and at foulde s he saw that he was expected ; that they were pleased to see him , and prided themselves on his happiness , just as every one whom he had to do with during those days .
what was extraordinary was that everyone not only liked him , but even people previously unsympathetic , cold , and callous , were enthusiastic over him , gave way to him in everything , treated his feeling with tenderness and delicacy , and shared his conviction that he was the happiest man in the world because his betrothed was beyond perfection .
kitty too felt the same thing .
when countess nordston ventured to hint that she had hoped for something better , kitty was so angry and proved so conclusively that nothing in the world could be better than levin , that countess nordston had to admit it , and in kitty s presence never met levin without a smile of ecstatic admiration .
the confession he had promised was the one painful incident of this time .
he consulted the old prince , and with his sanction gave kitty his diary , in which there was written the confession that tortured him .
he had written this diary at the time with a view to his future wife .
two things caused him anguish his lack of purity and his lack of faith .
his confession of unbelief passed unnoticed .
she was religious , had never doubted the truths of religion , but his external unbelief did not affect her in the least .
through love she knew all his soul , and in his soul she saw what she wanted , and that such a state of soul should be called unbelieving was to her a matter of no account .
the other confession set her weeping bitterly .
levin , not without an inner struggle , handed her his diary .
he knew that between him and her there could not be , and should not be , secrets , and so he had decided that so it must be .
but he had not realized what an effect it would have on her , he had not put himself in her place .
it was only when the same evening he came to their house before the theater , went into her room and saw her , pitiful , sweet face , miserable with suffering he had caused and nothing could undo , he felt the abyss that separated his shameful past from her dovelike purity , and was appalled at what he had done .
take them , take these dreadful books !
she said , pushing away the notebooks lying before her on the table .
why did you give them me ?
no , it was better anyway , she added , touched by his despairing face .
but it s awful , awful !
his head sank , and he was silent .
he could say nothing .
you can t forgive me , he whispered .
yes , i forgive you ; but it s terrible !
but his happiness was so immense that this confession did not shatter it , it only added another shade to it .
she forgave him ; but from that time more than ever he considered himself unworthy of her , morally bowed down lower than ever before her , and prized more highly than ever his undeserved happiness .
unconsciously going over in his memory the conversations that had taken place during and after dinner , alexey alexandrovitch returned to his solitary room .
darya alexandrovna s words about forgiveness had aroused in him nothing but annoyance .
the applicability or of the christian precept to his own case was too difficult a question to be discussed lightly , and this question had long ago been answered by alexey alexandrovitch in the negative .
of all that had been said , what stuck most in his memory was the phrase of stupid , like a man , he did !
called him out and shot him ! everyone had apparently shared this feeling , though from politeness they had not expressed it .
but the matter is settled , it s useless thinking about it , alexey alexandrovitch told himself .
and thinking of nothing but the journey before him , and the revision work he had to do , he went into his room and asked the porter who escorted him where his man was .
the porter said that the man had only just gone out .
alexey alexandrovitch ordered tea to be sent him , sat down to the table , and taking the guidebook , began considering the route of his journey .
two telegrams , said his manservant , coming into the room .
i beg your pardon , your excellency ; i d only just that minute gone out .
alexey alexandrovitch took the telegrams and opened them .
the first telegram was the announcement of stremov s appointment to the very post karenin had coveted .
alexey alexandrovitch flung the telegram down , and flushing a little , got up and began to pace up and down the room .
vult perdere , he said , meaning by the persons responsible for this appointment .
he was not so much annoyed that he had not received the post , that he had been conspicuously passed over ; but it was incomprehensible , amazing to him that they did not see that the wordy stremov was the last man fit for it .
how could they fail to see how they were ruining themselves , lowering their by this appointment ?
something else in the same line , he said to himself bitterly , opening the second telegram .
the telegram was from his wife .
her name , written in blue pencil , anna , was the first thing that caught his eye .
i am dying ; i beg , i implore you to come .
i shall die easier with your forgiveness , he read .
he smiled contemptuously , and flung down the telegram .
that this was a trick and a fraud , of that , he thought for the first minute , there could be no doubt .
there is no deceit she would stick at .
she was near her confinement .
perhaps it is the confinement .
but what can be their aim ?
to legitimize the child , to compromise me , and prevent a divorce , he thought .
but something was said in it i am dying he read the telegram again , and suddenly the plain meaning of what was said in it struck him .
and if it is true ?
he said to himself .
if it is true that in the moment of agony and nearness to death she is genuinely penitent , and i , taking it for a trick , refuse to go ?
that would not only be cruel , and everyone would blame me , but it would be stupid on my part .
piotr , call a coach ; i am going to petersburg , he said to his servant .
alexey alexandrovitch decided that he would go to petersburg and see his wife .
if her illness was a trick , he would say nothing and go away again .
if she was really in danger , and wished to see him before her death , he would forgive her if he found her alive , and pay her the last duties if he came too late .
all the way he thought no more of what he ought to do .
with a sense of weariness and uncleanness from the night spent in the train , in the early fog of petersburg alexey alexandrovitch drove through the deserted nevsky and stared straight before him , not thinking of what was awaiting him .
he could not think about it , because in picturing what would happen , he could not drive away the reflection that her death would at once remove all the difficulty of his position .
bakers , closed shops , , porters sweeping the pavements flashed past his eyes , and he watched it all , trying to smother the thought of what was awaiting him , and what he dared not hope for , and yet was hoping for .
he drove up to the steps .
a sledge and a carriage with the coachman asleep stood at the entrance .
as he went into the entry , alexey alexandrovitch , as it were , got out his resolution from the remotest corner of his brain , and mastered it thoroughly .
its meaning ran if it s a trick , then calm contempt and departure .
if truth , do what is proper .
the porter opened the door before alexey alexandrovitch rang .
the porter , kapitonitch , looked queer in an old coat , without a tie , and in slippers .
how is your mistress ?
a successful confinement yesterday .
alexey alexandrovitch stopped short and turned white .
he felt distinctly now how intensely he had longed for her death .
and how is she ?
korney in his morning apron ran downstairs .
very ill , he answered .
there was a consultation yesterday , and the doctor s here now .
take my things , said alexey alexandrovitch , and feeling some relief at the news that there was still hope of her death , he went into the hall .
on the hatstand there was a military overcoat .
alexey alexandrovitch noticed it and asked who is here ?
the doctor , the midwife , and count vronsky .
alexey alexandrovitch went into the inner rooms .
in the drawing room there was no one ; at the sound of his steps there came out of her boudoir the midwife in a cap with lilac ribbons .
she went up to alexey alexandrovitch , and with the familiarity given by the approach of death took him by the arm and drew him towards the bedroom .
thank god you ve come !
she keeps on about you and nothing but you , she said .
make haste with the ice !
the doctor s peremptory voice said from the bedroom .
alexey alexandrovitch went into her boudoir .
at the table , sitting sideways in a low chair , was vronsky , his face hidden in his hands , weeping .
he jumped up at the doctor s voice , took his hands from his face , and saw alexey alexandrovitch .
seeing the husband , he was so overwhelmed that he sat down again , drawing his head down to his shoulders , as if he wanted to disappear ; but he made an effort over himself , got up and said she is dying .
the doctors say there is no hope .
i am entirely in your power , only let me be here though i am at your disposal .
i alexey alexandrovitch , seeing vronsky s tears , felt a rush of that nervous emotion always produced in him by the sight of other people s suffering , and turning away his face , he moved hurriedly to the door , without hearing the rest of his words .
from the bedroom came the sound of anna s voice saying something .
her voice was lively , eager , with exceedingly distinct intonations .
alexey alexandrovitch went into the bedroom , and went up to the bed .
she was lying turned with her face towards him .
her cheeks were flushed crimson , her eyes glittered , her little white hands thrust out from the sleeves of her dressing gown were playing with the quilt , twisting it about .
it seemed as though she were not only well and blooming , but in the happiest frame of mind .
she was talking rapidly , musically , and with exceptionally correct articulation and expressive intonation .
for am speaking of alexey alexandrovitch ( what a strange and awful thing that both are alexey , isn t it ?
) would not refuse me .
i should forget , he would forgive
but why doesn t he come ?
he s so good he doesn t know himself how good he is .
ah , my god , what agony !
give me some water , quick !
oh , that will be bad for her , my little girl !
oh , very well then , give her to a nurse .
yes , i agree , it s better in fact .
he ll be coming ; it will hurt him to see her .
give her to the nurse .
anna arkadyevna , he has come .
here he is !
said the midwife , trying to attract her attention to alexey alexandrovitch .
oh , what nonsense !
anna went on , not seeing her husband .
no , give her to me ; give me my little one !
he has not come yet .
you say he won t forgive me , because you don t know him .
no one knows him .
i m the only one , and it was hard for me even .
his eyes i ought to has just the same i can t bear to see them because of it .
has seryozha had his dinner ?
i know everyone will forget him .
he would not forget .
seryozha must be moved into the corner room , and mariette must be asked to sleep with him .
all of a sudden she shrank back , was silent ; and in terror , as though expecting a blow , as though to defend herself , she raised her hands to her face .
she had seen her husband .
no , no !
she began .
i am not afraid of him ; i am afraid of death .
alexey , come here .
i am in a hurry , because i ve no time , i ve not long left to live ; the fever will begin directly and i shall understand nothing more .
now i understand , i understand it all , i see it all !
alexey alexandrovitch s wrinkled face wore an expression of agony ; he took her by the hand and tried to say something , but he could not utter it ; his lower lip quivered , but he still went on struggling with his emotion , and only now and then glanced at her .
and each time he glanced at her , he saw her eyes gazing at him with such passionate and triumphant tenderness as he had never seen in them .
wait a minute , you don t know stay a little , stay !
she stopped , as though collecting her ideas .
yes , she began ; yes , yes , yes .
this is what i wanted to say .
don t be surprised at me .
i m still the same
but there is another woman in me , i m afraid of her she loved that man , and i tried to hate you , and could not forget about her that used to be .
i m not that woman .
now i m my real self , all myself .
i m dying now , i know i shall die , ask him .
even now i here , the weights on my feet , on my hands , on my fingers .
my how huge they are !
but this will soon all be over only one thing i want forgive me , forgive me quite .
i m terrible , but my nurse used to tell me ; the holy was her name ?
she was worse .
and i ll go to rome ; there s a wilderness , and there i shall be no trouble to any one , only i ll take seryozha and the little one no , you can t forgive me !
i know , it can t be forgiven !
no , no , go away , you re too good !
she held his hand in one burning hand , while she pushed him away with the other .
the nervous agitation of alexey alexandrovitch kept increasing , and had by now reached such a point that he ceased to struggle with it .
he suddenly felt that what he had regarded as nervous agitation was on the contrary a blissful spiritual condition that gave him all at once a new happiness he had never known .
he did not think that the christian law that he had been all his life trying to follow , enjoined on him to forgive and love his enemies ; but a glad feeling of love and forgiveness for his enemies filled his heart .
he knelt down , and laying his head in the curve of her arm , which burned him as with fire through the sleeve , he sobbed like a little child .
she put her arm around his head , moved towards him , and with defiant pride lifted up her eyes .
that is he .
i knew him !
now , forgive me , everyone , forgive me !
they ve come again ; why don t they go away ?
oh , take these cloaks off me !
the doctor unloosed her hands , carefully laying her on the pillow , and covered her up to the shoulders .
she lay back submissively , and looked before her with beaming eyes .
remember one thing , that i needed nothing but forgiveness , and i want nothing more why doesn t come ?
she said , turning to the door towards vronsky .
do come , do come !
give him your hand .
vronsky came to the side of the bed , and seeing anna , again hid his face in his hands .
uncover your at him !
he s a saint , she said .
oh !
uncover your face , do uncover it !
she said angrily .
alexey alexandrovitch , do uncover his face !
i want to see him .
alexey alexandrovitch took vronsky s hands and drew them away from his face , which was awful with the expression of agony and shame upon it .
give him your hand .
forgive him .
alexey alexandrovitch gave him his hand , not attempting to restrain the tears that streamed from his eyes .
thank god , thank god !
she said , now everything is ready .
only to stretch my legs a little .
there , that s capital .
how badly these flowers are a bit like a violet , she said , pointing to the hangings .
my god , my god !
when will it end ?
give me some morphine .
doctor , give me some morphine !
oh , my god , my god !
and she tossed about on the bed .
the doctors said that it was puerperal fever , and that it was chances in a hundred it would end in death .
the whole day long there was fever , delirium , and unconsciousness .
at midnight the patient lay without consciousness , and almost without pulse .
the end was expected every minute .
vronsky had gone home , but in the morning he came to inquire , and alexey alexandrovitch meeting him in the hall , said better stay , she might ask for you , and himself led him to his wife s boudoir .
towards morning , there was a return again of excitement , rapid thought and talk , and again it ended in unconsciousness .
on the third day it was the same thing , and the doctors said there was hope .
that day alexey alexandrovitch went into the boudoir where vronsky was sitting , and closing the door sat down opposite him .
alexey alexandrovitch , said vronsky , feeling that a statement of the position was coming , i can t speak , i can t understand .
spare me !
however hard it is for you , believe me , it is more terrible for me .
he would have risen ; but alexey alexandrovitch took him by the hand and said i beg you to hear me out ; it is necessary .
i must explain my feelings , the feelings that have guided me and will guide me , so that you may not be in error regarding me .
you know i had resolved on a divorce , and had even begun to take proceedings .
i won t conceal from you that in beginning this i was in uncertainty , i was in misery ; i will confess that i was pursued by a desire to revenge myself on you and on her .
when i got the telegram , i came here with the same feelings ; i will say more , i longed for her death .
but he paused , pondering whether to disclose or not to disclose his feeling to him .
but i saw her and forgave her .
and the happiness of forgiveness has revealed to me my duty .
i forgive completely .
i would offer the other cheek , i would give my cloak if my coat be taken .
i pray to god only not to take from me the bliss of forgiveness !
tears stood in his eyes , and the luminous , serene look in them impressed vronsky .
this is my position you can trample me in the mud , make me the of the world , i will not abandon her , and i will never utter a word of reproach to you , alexey alexandrovitch went on .
my duty is clearly marked for me ; i ought to be with her , and i will be .
if she wishes to see you , i will let you know , but now i suppose it would be better for you to go away .
he got up , and sobs cut short his words .
vronsky too was getting up , and in a stooping , not yet erect posture , looked up at him from under his brows .
he did not understand alexey alexandrovitch s feeling , but he felt that it was something higher and even unattainable for him with his view of life .
after the conversation with alexey alexandrovitch , vronsky went out onto the steps of the karenins house and stood still , with difficulty remembering where he was , and where he ought to walk or drive .
he felt disgraced , humiliated , guilty , and deprived of all possibility of washing away his humiliation .
he felt thrust out of the beaten track along which he had so proudly and lightly walked till then .
all the habits and rules of his life that had seemed so firm , had turned out suddenly false and inapplicable .
the betrayed husband , who had figured till that time as a pitiful creature , an incidental and somewhat ludicrous obstacle to his happiness , had suddenly been summoned by her herself , elevated to an pinnacle , and on the pinnacle that husband had shown himself , not malignant , not false , not ludicrous , but kind and straightforward and large .
vronsky could not but feel this , and the parts were suddenly reversed .
vronsky felt his elevation and his own abasement , his truth and his own falsehood .
he felt that the husband was magnanimous even in his sorrow , while he had been base and petty in his deceit .
but this sense of his own humiliation before the man he had unjustly despised made up only a small part of his misery .
he felt unutterably wretched now , for his passion for anna , which had seemed to him of late to be growing cooler , now that he knew he had lost her forever , was stronger than ever it had been .
he had seen all of her in her illness , had come to know her very soul , and it seemed to him that he had never loved her till then .
and now when he had learned to know her , to love her as she should be loved , he had been humiliated before her , and had lost her forever , leaving with her nothing of himself but a shameful memory .
most terrible of all had been his ludicrous , shameful position when alexey alexandrovitch had pulled his hands away from his humiliated face .
he stood on the steps of the karenins house like one distraught , and did not know what to do .
a sledge , sir ?
asked the porter .
yes , a sledge .
on getting home , after three sleepless nights , vronsky , without undressing , lay down flat on the sofa , clasping his hands and laying his head on them .
his head was heavy .
images , memories , and ideas of the strangest description followed one another with extraordinary rapidity and vividness .
first it was the medicine he had poured out for the patient and spilt over the spoon , then the midwife s white hands , then the queer posture of alexey alexandrovitch on the floor beside the bed .
to sleep !
to forget !
he said to himself with the serene confidence of a healthy man that if he is tired and sleepy , he will go to sleep at once .
and the same instant his head did begin to feel drowsy and he began to drop off into forgetfulness .
the waves of the sea of unconsciousness had begun to meet over his head , when all at was as though a violent shock of electricity had passed over him .
he started so that he leaped up on the springs of the sofa , and leaning on his arms got in a panic onto his knees .
his eyes were wide open as though he had never been asleep .
the heaviness in his head and the weariness in his limbs that he had felt a minute before had suddenly gone .
you may trample me in the mud , he heard alexey alexandrovitch s words and saw him standing before him , and saw anna s face with its burning flush and glittering eyes , gazing with love and tenderness not at him but at alexey alexandrovitch ; he saw his own , as he fancied , foolish and ludicrous figure when alexey alexandrovitch took his hands away from his face .
he stretched out his legs again and flung himself on the sofa in the same position and shut his eyes .
to sleep !
to forget !
he repeated to himself .
but with his eyes shut he saw more distinctly than ever anna s face as it had been on the memorable evening before the races .
that is not and will not be , and she wants to wipe it out of her memory .
but i can not live without it .
how can we be reconciled ?
how can we be reconciled ?
he said aloud , and unconsciously began to repeat these words .
this repetition checked the rising up of fresh images and memories , which he felt were thronging in his brain .
but repeating words did not check his imagination for long .
again in extraordinarily rapid succession his best moments rose before his mind , and then his recent humiliation .
take away his hands , anna s voice says .
he takes away his hands and feels the shamestruck and idiotic expression of his face .
he still lay down , trying to sleep , though he felt there was not the smallest hope of it , and kept repeating stray words from some chain of thought , trying by this to check the rising flood of fresh images .
he listened , and heard in a strange , mad whisper words repeated i did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it .
i did not appreciate it , did not make enough of it .
what s this ?
am i going out of my mind ?
he said to himself .
perhaps .
what makes men go out of their minds ; what makes men shoot themselves ?
he answered himself , and opening his eyes , he saw with wonder an embroidered cushion beside him , worked by varya , his brother s wife .
he touched the tassel of the cushion , and tried to think of varya , of when he had seen her last .
but to think of anything extraneous was an agonizing effort .
no , i must sleep !
he moved the cushion up , and pressed his head into it , but he had to make an effort to keep his eyes shut .
he jumped up and sat down .
that s all over for me , he said to himself .
i must think what to do .
what is left ?
his mind rapidly ran through his life apart from his love of anna .
ambition ?
serpuhovskoy ?
society ?
the court ?
he could not come to a pause anywhere .
all of it had had meaning before , but now there was no reality in it .
he got up from the sofa , took off his coat , undid his belt , and uncovering his hairy chest to breathe more freely , walked up and down the room .
this is how people go mad , he repeated , and how they shoot themselves to escape humiliation , he added slowly .
he went to the door and closed it , then with fixed eyes and clenched teeth he went up to the table , took a revolver , looked round him , turned it to a loaded barrel , and sank into thought .
for two minutes , his head bent forward with an expression of an intense effort of thought , he stood with the revolver in his hand , motionless , thinking .
of course , he said to himself , as though a logical , continuous , and clear chain of reasoning had brought him to an indubitable conclusion .
in reality this of course , that seemed convincing to him , was simply the result of exactly the same circle of memories and images through which he had passed ten times already during the last of happiness lost forever .
there was the same conception of the senselessness of everything to come in life , the same consciousness of humiliation .
even the sequence of these images and emotions was the same .
of course , he repeated , when for the third time his thought passed again round the same spellbound circle of memories and images , and pulling the revolver to the left side of his chest , and clutching it vigorously with his whole hand , as it were , squeezing it in his fist , he pulled the trigger .
he did not hear the sound of the shot , but a violent blow on his chest sent him reeling .
he tried to clutch at the edge of the table , dropped the revolver , staggered , and sat down on the ground , looking about him in astonishment .
he did not recognize his room , looking up from the ground , at the bent legs of the table , at the wastepaper basket , and the rug .
the hurried , creaking steps of his servant coming through the drawing room brought him to his senses .
he made an effort at thought , and was aware that he was on the floor ; and seeing blood on the rug and on his arm , he knew he had shot himself .
idiotic !
missed !
he said , fumbling after the revolver .
the revolver was close beside sought further off .
still feeling for it , he stretched out to the other side , and not being strong enough to keep his balance , fell over , streaming with blood .
the elegant , whiskered manservant , who used to be continually complaining to his acquaintances of the delicacy of his nerves , was so on seeing his master lying on the floor , that he left him losing blood while he ran for assistance .
an hour later varya , his brother s wife , had arrived , and with the assistance of three doctors , whom she had sent for in all directions , and who all appeared at the same moment , she got the wounded man to bed , and remained to nurse him .
the mistake made by alexey alexandrovitch in that , when preparing for seeing his wife , he had overlooked the possibility that her repentance might be sincere , and he might forgive her , and she might not mistake was two months after his return from moscow brought home to him in all its significance .
but the mistake made by him had arisen not simply from his having overlooked that contingency , but also from the fact that until that day of his interview with his dying wife , he had not known his own heart .
at his sick wife s bedside he had for the first time in his life given way to that feeling of sympathetic suffering always roused in him by the sufferings of others , and hitherto looked on by him with shame as a harmful weakness .
and pity for her , and remorse for having desired her death , and most of all , the joy of forgiveness , made him at once conscious , not simply of the relief of his own sufferings , but of a spiritual peace he had never experienced before .
he suddenly felt that the very thing that was the source of his sufferings had become the source of his spiritual joy ; that what had seemed insoluble while he was judging , blaming , and hating , had become clear and simple when he forgave and loved .
he forgave his wife and pitied her for her sufferings and her remorse .
he forgave vronsky , and pitied him , especially after reports reached him of his despairing action .
he felt more for his son than before .
and he blamed himself now for having taken too little interest in him .
but for the little newborn baby he felt a quite peculiar sentiment , not of pity , only , but of tenderness .
at first , from a feeling of compassion alone , he had been interested in the delicate little creature , who was not his child , and who was cast on one side during her mother s illness , and would certainly have died if he had not troubled about her , and he did not himself observe how fond he became of her .
he would go into the nursery several times a day , and sit there for a long while , so that the nurses , who were at first afraid of him , got quite used to his presence .
sometimes for half an hour at a stretch he would sit silently gazing at the , downy , wrinkled face of the sleeping baby , watching the movements of the frowning brows , and the fat little hands , with clenched fingers , that rubbed the little eyes and nose .
at such moments particularly , alexey alexandrovitch had a sense of perfect peace and inward harmony , and saw nothing extraordinary in his position , nothing that ought to be changed .
but as time went on , he saw more and more distinctly that however natural the position now seemed to him , he would not long be allowed to remain in it .
he felt that besides the blessed spiritual force controlling his soul , there was another , a brutal force , as powerful , or more powerful , which controlled his life , and that this force would not allow him that humble peace he longed for .
he felt that everyone was looking at him with inquiring wonder , that he was not understood , and that something was expected of him .
above all , he felt the instability and unnaturalness of his relations with his wife .
when the softening effect of the near approach of death had passed away , alexey alexandrovitch began to notice that anna was afraid of him , ill at ease with him , and could not look him straight in the face .
she seemed to be wanting , and not daring , to tell him something ; and as though foreseeing their present relations could not continue , she seemed to be expecting something from him .
towards the end of february it happened that anna s baby daughter , who had been named anna too , fell alexey alexandrovitch was in the nursery in the morning , and leaving orders for the doctor to be sent for , he went to his office .
on finishing his work , he returned home at four .
going into the hall he saw a handsome groom , in a braided livery and a bear fur cape , holding a white fur cloak .
who is here ?
asked alexey alexandrovitch .
princess elizaveta federovna tverskaya , the groom answered , and it seemed to alexey alexandrovitch that he grinned .
during all this difficult time alexey alexandrovitch had noticed that his worldly acquaintances , especially women , took a peculiar interest in him and his wife .
all these acquaintances he observed with difficulty concealing their mirth at something ; the same mirth that he had perceived in the lawyer s eyes , and just now in the eyes of this groom .
everyone seemed , somehow , hugely delighted , as though they had just been at a wedding .
when they met him , with enjoyment they inquired after his wife s health .
the presence of princess tverskaya was unpleasant to alexey alexandrovitch from the memories associated with her , and also because he disliked her , and he went straight to the nursery .
in the day nursery seryozha , leaning on the table with his legs on a chair , was drawing and chatting away merrily .
the english governess , who had during anna s illness replaced the french one , was sitting near the boy knitting a shawl .
she hurriedly got up , curtseyed , and pulled seryozha .
alexey alexandrovitch stroked his son s hair , answered the governess s inquiries about his wife , and asked what the doctor had said of the baby .
the doctor said it was nothing serious , and he ordered a bath , sir .
but she is still in pain , said alexey alexandrovitch , listening to the baby s screaming in the next room .
i think it s the , sir , the englishwoman said firmly .
what makes you think so ?
he asked , stopping short .
it s just as it was at countess paul s , sir .
they gave the baby medicine , and it turned out that the baby was simply hungry the nurse had no milk , sir .
alexey alexandrovitch pondered , and after standing still a few seconds he went in at the other door .
the baby was lying with its head thrown back , stiffening itself in the nurse s arms , and would not take the plump breast offered it ; and it never ceased screaming in spite of the double hushing of the and the other nurse , who was bending over her .
still no better ?
said alexey alexandrovitch .
she s very restless , answered the nurse in a whisper .
miss edwarde says that perhaps the has no milk , he said .
i think so too , alexey alexandrovitch .
then why didn t you say so ?
who s one to say it to ?
anna arkadyevna still ill said the nurse discontentedly .
the nurse was an old servant of the family .
and in her simple words there seemed to alexey alexandrovitch an allusion to his position .
the baby screamed louder than ever , struggling and sobbing .
the nurse , with a gesture of despair , went to it , took it from the s arms , and began walking up and down , rocking it .
you must ask the doctor to examine the , said alexey alexandrovitch .
the smartly dressed and nurse , frightened at the idea of losing her place , muttered something to herself , and covering her bosom , smiled contemptuously at the idea of doubts being cast on her abundance of milk .
in that smile , too , alexey alexandrovitch saw a sneer at his position .
luckless child !
said the nurse , hushing the baby , and still walking up and down with it .
alexey alexandrovitch sat down , and with a despondent and suffering face watched the nurse walking to and fro .
when the child at last was still , and had been put in a deep bed , and the nurse , after smoothing the little pillow , had left her , alexey alexandrovitch got up , and walking awkwardly on tiptoe , approached the baby .
for a minute he was still , and with the same despondent face gazed at the baby ; but all at once a smile , that moved his hair and the skin of his forehead , came out on his face , and he went as softly out of the room .
in the dining room he rang the bell , and told the servant who came in to send again for the doctor .
he felt vexed with his wife for not being anxious about this exquisite baby , and in this vexed humor he had no wish to go to her ; he had no wish , either , to see princess betsy .
but his wife might wonder why he did not go to her as usual ; and so , overcoming his disinclination , he went towards the bedroom .
as he walked over the soft rug towards the door , he could not help overhearing a conversation he did not want to hear .
if he hadn t been going away , i could have understood your answer and his too .
but your husband ought to be above that , betsy was saying .
it s not for my husband ; for myself i don t wish it .
don t say that !
answered anna s excited voice .
yes , but you must care to say to a man who has shot himself on your account that s just why i don t want to .
with a dismayed and guilty expression , alexey alexandrovitch stopped and would have gone back unobserved .
but reflecting that this would be undignified , he turned back again , and clearing his throat , he went up to the bedroom .
the voices were silent , and he went in .
anna , in a gray dressing gown , with a crop of short clustering black curls on her round head , was sitting on a settee .
the eagerness died out of her face , as it always did , at the sight of her husband ; she dropped her head and looked round uneasily at betsy .
betsy , dressed in the height of the latest fashion , in a hat that towered somewhere over her head like a shade on a lamp , in a blue dress with violet crossway stripes slanting one way on the bodice and the other way on the skirt , was sitting beside anna , her tall flat figure held erect .
bowing her head , she greeted alexey alexandrovitch with an ironical smile .
ah !
she said , as though surprised .
i m very glad you re at home .
you never put in an appearance anywhere , and i haven t seen you ever since anna has been ill .
i have heard all about anxiety .
yes , you re a wonderful husband !
she said , with a meaning and affable air , as though she were bestowing an order of magnanimity on him for his conduct to his wife .
alexey alexandrovitch bowed frigidly , and kissing his wife s hand , asked how she was .
better , i think , she said , avoiding his eyes .
but you ve rather a color , he said , laying stress on the word feverish .
we ve been talking too much , said betsy .
i feel it s selfishness on my part , and i am going away .
she got up , but anna , suddenly flushing , quickly caught at her hand .
no , wait a minute , please .
i must tell you no , you .
she turned to alexey alexandrovitch , and her neck and brow were suffused with crimson .
i won t and can t keep anything secret from you , she said .
alexey alexandrovitch cracked his fingers and bowed his head .
betsy s been telling me that count vronsky wants to come here to say before his departure for tashkend .
she did not look at her husband , and was evidently in haste to have everything out , however hard it might be for her .
i told her i could not receive him .
you said , my dear , that it would depend on alexey alexandrovitch , betsy corrected her .
oh , no , i can t receive him ; and what object would there she stopped suddenly , and glanced inquiringly at her husband ( he did not look at her ) .
in short , i don t wish it alexey alexandrovitch advanced and would have taken her hand .
her first impulse was to jerk back her hand from the damp hand with big swollen veins that sought hers , but with an obvious effort to control herself she pressed his hand .
i am very grateful to you for your confidence , but he said , feeling with confusion and annoyance that what he could decide easily and clearly by himself , he could not discuss before princess tverskaya , who to him stood for the incarnation of that brute force which would inevitably control him in the life he led in the eyes of the world , and hinder him from giving way to his feeling of love and forgiveness .
he stopped short , looking at princess tverskaya .
well , , my darling , said betsy , getting up .
she kissed anna , and went out .
alexey alexandrovitch escorted her out .
alexey alexandrovitch !
i know you are a truly magnanimous man , said betsy , stopping in the little , and with special warmth shaking hands with him once more .
i am an outsider , but i so love her and respect you that i venture to advise .
receive him .
alexey vronsky is the soul of honor , and he is going away to tashkend .
thank you , princess , for your sympathy and advice .
but the question of whether my wife can or can not see anyone she must decide herself .
he said this from habit , lifting his brows with dignity , and reflected immediately that whatever his words might be , there could be no dignity in his position .
and he saw this by the suppressed , malicious , and ironical smile with which betsy glanced at him after this phrase .
alexey alexandrovitch took leave of betsy in the drawing room , and went to his wife .
she was lying down , but hearing his steps she sat up hastily in her former attitude , and looked in a scared way at him .
he saw she had been crying .
i am very grateful for your confidence in me .
he repeated gently in russian the phrase he had said in betsy s presence in french , and sat down beside her .
when he spoke to her in russian , using the russian thou of intimacy and affection , it was insufferably irritating to anna .
and i am very grateful for your decision .
i , too , imagine that since he is going away , there is no sort of necessity for count vronsky to come here .
however , if but i ve said so already , so why repeat it ?
anna suddenly interrupted him with an irritation she could not succeed in repressing .
no sort of necessity , she thought , for a man to come and say to the woman he loves , for whom he was ready to ruin himself , and has ruined himself , and who can not live without him .
no sort of necessity !
she compressed her lips , and dropped her burning eyes to his hands with their swollen veins .
they were rubbing each other .
let us never speak of it , she added more calmly .
i have left this question to you to decide , and i am very glad to see alexey alexandrovitch was beginning .
that my wish coincides with your own , she finished quickly , exasperated at his talking so slowly while she knew beforehand all he would say .
yes , he assented ; and princess tverskaya s interference in the most difficult private affairs is utterly uncalled for .
she especially i don t believe a word of what s said about her , said anna quickly .
i know she really cares for me .
alexey alexandrovitch sighed and said nothing .
she played nervously with the tassel of her , glancing at him with that torturing sensation of physical repulsion for which she blamed herself , though she could not control it .
her only desire now was to be rid of his oppressive presence .
i have just sent for the doctor , said alexey alexandrovitch .
i am very well ; what do i want the doctor for ?
no , the little one cries , and they say the nurse hasn t enough milk .
why didn t you let me nurse her , when i begged to ?
anyway ( alexey alexandrovitch knew what was meant by that anyway ) , she s a baby , and they re killing her .
she rang the bell and ordered the baby to be brought her .
i begged to nurse her , i wasn t allowed to , and now i m blamed for it .
i don t blame yes , you do blame me !
my god !
why didn t i die !
and she broke into sobs .
forgive me , i m nervous , i m unjust , she said , controlling herself , but do go away no , it can t go on like this , alexey alexandrovitch said to himself decidedly as he left his wife s room .
never had the impossibility of his position in the world s eyes , and his wife s hatred of him , and altogether the might of that mysterious brutal force that guided his life against his spiritual inclinations , and exacted conformity with its decrees and change in his attitude to his wife , been presented to him with such distinctness as that day .
he saw clearly that all the world and his wife expected of him something , but what exactly , he could not make out .
he felt that this was rousing in his soul a feeling of anger destructive of his peace of mind and of all the good of his achievement .
he believed that for anna herself it would be better to break off all relations with vronsky ; but if they all thought this out of the question , he was even ready to allow these relations to be renewed , so long as the children were not disgraced , and he was not deprived of them nor forced to change his position .
bad as this might be , it was anyway better than a rupture , which would put her in a hopeless and shameful position , and deprive him of everything he cared for .
but he felt helpless ; he knew beforehand that every one was against him , and that he would not be allowed to do what seemed to him now so natural and right , but would be forced to do what was wrong , though it seemed the proper thing to them .
before betsy had time to walk out of the , she was met in the doorway by stepan arkadyevitch , who had just come from yeliseev s , where a consignment of fresh oysters had been received .
ah !
princess !
what a delightful meeting !
he began .
i ve been to see you .
a meeting for one minute , for i m going , said betsy , smiling and putting on her glove .
don t put on your glove yet , princess ; let me kiss your hand .
there s nothing i m so thankful to the revival of the old fashions for as the kissing the hand .
he kissed betsy s hand .
when shall we see each other ?
you don t deserve it , answered betsy , smiling .
oh , yes , i deserve a great deal , for i ve become a most serious person .
i don t only manage my own affairs , but other people s too , he said , with a significant expression .
oh , i m so glad !
answered betsy , at once understanding that he was speaking of anna .
and going back into the drawing room , they stood in a corner .
he s killing her , said betsy in a whisper full of meaning .
it s impossible , impossible i m so glad you think so , said stepan arkadyevitch , shaking his head with a serious and sympathetically distressed expression , that s what i ve come to petersburg for .
the whole town s talking of it , she said .
it s an impossible position .
she pines and pines away .
he doesn t understand that she s one of those women who can t trifle with their feelings .
one of two things either let him take her away , act with energy , or give her a divorce .
this is stifling her .
yes , yes just so oblonsky said , sighing .
that s what i ve come for .
at least not solely for that i ve been made a ; of course , one has to say thank you .
but the chief thing was having to settle this .
well , god help you !
said betsy .
after accompanying betsy to the outside hall , once more kissing her hand above the glove , at the point where the pulse beats , and murmuring to her such unseemly nonsense that she did not know whether to laugh or be angry , stepan arkadyevitch went to his sister .
he found her in tears .
although he happened to be bubbling over with good spirits , stepan arkadyevitch immediately and quite naturally fell into the sympathetic , poetically emotional tone which harmonized with her mood .
he asked her how she was , and how she had spent the morning .
very , very miserably .
today and this morning and all past days and days to come , she said .
i think you re giving way to pessimism .
you must rouse yourself , you must look life in the face .
i know it s hard , but i have heard it said that women love men even for their vices , anna began suddenly , but i hate him for his virtues .
i can t live with him .
do you understand ?
the sight of him has a physical effect on me , it makes me beside myself .
i can t , i can t live with him .
what am i to do ?
i have been unhappy , and used to think one couldn t be more unhappy , but the awful state of things i am going through now , i could never have conceived .
would you believe it , that knowing he s a good man , a splendid man , that i m not worth his little finger , still i hate him .
i hate him for his generosity .
and there s nothing left for me but she would have said death , but stepan arkadyevitch would not let her finish .
you are ill and overwrought , he said ; believe me , you re exaggerating dreadfully .
there s nothing so terrible in it .
and stepan arkadyevitch smiled .
no one else in stepan arkadyevitch s place , having to do with such despair , would have ventured to smile ( the smile would have seemed brutal ) ; but in his smile there was so much of sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound , but softened and soothed .
his gentle , soothing words and smiles were as soothing and softening as almond oil .
and anna soon felt this .
no , stiva , she said , i m lost , lost !
worse than lost !
i can t say yet that all is over ; on the contrary , i feel that it s not over .
i m an overstrained string that must snap .
but it s not ended yet and it will have a fearful end .
no matter , we must let the string be loosened , little by little .
there s no position from which there is no way of escape .
i have thought , and thought .
only one again he knew from her terrified eyes that this one way of escape in her thought was death , and he would not let her say it .
not at all , he said .
listen to me .
you can t see your own position as i can .
let me tell you candidly my opinion .
again he smiled discreetly his smile .
i ll begin from the beginning .
you married a man twenty years older than yourself .
you married him without love and not knowing what love was .
it was a mistake , let s admit .
a fearful mistake !
said anna .
but i repeat , it s an accomplished fact .
then you had , let us say , the misfortune to love a man not your husband .
that was a misfortune ; but that , too , is an accomplished fact .
and your husband knew it and forgave it .
he stopped at each sentence , waiting for her to object , but she made no answer .
that s so .
now the question is can you go on living with your husband ?
do you wish it ?
does he wish it ?
i know nothing , nothing .
but you said yourself that you can t endure him .
no , i didn t say so .
i deny it .
i can t tell , i don t know anything about it .
yes , but let you can t understand .
i feel i m lying head downwards in a sort of pit , but i ought not to save myself .
and i can t .
.
.
never mind , we ll slip something under and pull you out .
i understand you i understand that you can t take it on yourself to express your wishes , your feelings .
there s nothing , nothing i wish except for it to be all over .
but he sees this and knows it .
and do you suppose it weighs on him any less than on you ?
you re wretched , he s wretched , and what good can come of it ?
while divorce would solve the difficulty completely .
with some effort stepan arkadyevitch brought out his central idea , and looked significantly at her .
she said nothing , and shook her cropped head in dissent .
but from the look in her face , that suddenly brightened into its old beauty , he saw that if she did not desire this , it was simply because it seemed to her unattainable happiness .
i m awfully sorry for you !
and how happy i should be if i could arrange things !
said stepan arkadyevitch , smiling more boldly .
don t speak , don t say a word !
god grant only that i may speak as i feel .
i m going to him .
anna looked at him with dreamy , shining eyes , and said nothing .
stepan arkadyevitch , with the same somewhat solemn expression with which he used to take his presidential chair at his board , walked into alexey alexandrovitch s room .
alexey alexandrovitch was walking about his room with his hands behind his back , thinking of just what stepan arkadyevitch had been discussing with his wife .
i m not interrupting you ?
said stepan arkadyevitch , on the sight of his becoming suddenly aware of a sense of embarrassment unusual with him .
to conceal this embarrassment he took out a cigarette case he had just bought that opened in a new way , and sniffing the leather , took a cigarette out of it .
no .
do you want anything ?
alexey alexandrovitch asked without eagerness .
yes , i wished
i wanted yes , i wanted to talk to you , said stepan arkadyevitch , with surprise aware of an unaccustomed timidity .
this feeling was so unexpected and so strange that he did not believe it was the voice of conscience telling him that what he was meaning to do was wrong .
stepan arkadyevitch made an effort and struggled with the timidity that had come over him .
i hope you believe in my love for my sister and my sincere affection and respect for you , he said , reddening .
alexey alexandrovitch stood still and said nothing , but his face struck stepan arkadyevitch by its expression of an unresisting sacrifice .
i intended
i wanted to have a little talk with you about my sister and your mutual position , he said , still struggling with an unaccustomed constraint .
alexey alexandrovitch smiled mournfully , looked at his , and without answering went up to the table , took from it an unfinished letter , and handed it to his .
i think unceasingly of the same thing .
and here is what i had begun writing , thinking i could say it better by letter , and that my presence irritates her , he said , as he gave him the letter .
stepan arkadyevitch took the letter , looked with incredulous surprise at the lusterless eyes fixed so immovably on him , and began to read .
i see that my presence is irksome to you .
painful as it is to me to believe it , i see that it is so , and can not be otherwise .
i don t blame you , and god is my witness that on seeing you at the time of your illness i resolved with my whole heart to forget all that had passed between us and to begin a new life .
i do not regret , and shall never regret , what i have done ; but i have desired one good , the good of your now i see i have not attained that .
tell me yourself what will give you true happiness and peace to your soul .
i put myself entirely in your hands , and trust to your feeling of what s right .
stepan arkadyevitch handed back the letter , and with the same surprise continued looking at his , not knowing what to say .
this silence was so awkward for both of them that stepan arkadyevitch s lips began twitching nervously , while he still gazed without speaking at karenin s face .
that s what i wanted to say to her , said alexey alexandrovitch , turning away .
yes , yes said stepan arkadyevitch , not able to answer for the tears that were choking him .
yes , yes , i understand you , he brought out at last .
i want to know what she would like , said alexey alexandrovitch .
i am afraid she does not understand her own position .
she is not a judge , said stepan arkadyevitch , recovering himself .
she is crushed , simply crushed by your generosity .
if she were to read this letter , she would be incapable of saying anything , she would only hang her head lower than ever .
yes , but what s to be done in that case ?
how explain , how find out her wishes ?
if you will allow me to give my opinion , i think that it lies with you to point out directly the steps you consider necessary to end the position .
so you consider it must be ended ?
alexey alexandrovitch interrupted him .
but how ?
he added , with a gesture of his hands before his eyes not usual with him .
i see no possible way out of it .
there is some way of getting out of every position , said stepan arkadyevitch , standing up and becoming more cheerful .
there was a time when you thought of breaking off
if you are convinced now that you can not make each other happy happiness may be variously understood .
but suppose that i agree to everything , that i want nothing what way is there of getting out of our position ?
if you care to know my opinion , said stepan arkadyevitch with the same smile of softening , tenderness with which he had been talking to anna .
his kindly smile was so winning that alexey alexandrovitch , feeling his own weakness and unconsciously swayed by it , was ready to believe what stepan arkadyevitch was saying .
she will never speak out about it .
but one thing is possible , one thing she might desire , he went on , that is the cessation of your relations and all memories associated with them .
to my thinking , in your position what s essential is the formation of a new attitude to one another .
and that can only rest on a basis of freedom on both sides .
divorce , alexey alexandrovitch interrupted , in a tone of aversion .
yes , i imagine that , divorce , stepan arkadyevitch repeated , reddening .
that is from every point of view the most rational course for married people who find themselves in the position you are in .
what can be done if married people find that life is impossible for them together ?
that may always happen .
alexey alexandrovitch sighed heavily and closed his eyes .
there s only one point to be considered is either of the parties desirous of forming new ties ?
if not , it is very simple , said stepan arkadyevitch , feeling more and more free from constraint .
alexey alexandrovitch , scowling with emotion , muttered something to himself , and made no answer .
all that seemed so simple to stepan arkadyevitch , alexey alexandrovitch had thought over thousands of times .
and , so far from being simple , it all seemed to him utterly impossible .
divorce , the details of which he knew by this time , seemed to him now out of the question , because the sense of his own dignity and respect for religion forbade his taking upon himself a fictitious charge of adultery , and still more suffering his wife , pardoned and beloved by him , to be caught in the fact and put to public shame .
divorce appeared to him impossible also on other still more weighty grounds .
what would become of his son in case of a divorce ?
to leave him with his mother was out of the question .
the divorced mother would have her own illegitimate family , in which his position as a stepson and his education would not be good .
keep him with him ?
he knew that would be an act of vengeance on his part , and that he did not want .
but apart from this , what more than all made divorce seem impossible to alexey alexandrovitch was , that by consenting to a divorce he would be completely ruining anna .
the saying of darya alexandrovna at moscow , that in deciding on a divorce he was thinking of himself , and not considering that by this he would be ruining her irrevocably , had sunk into his heart .
and connecting this saying with his forgiveness of her , with his devotion to the children , he understood it now in his own way .
to consent to a divorce , to give her her freedom , meant in his thoughts to take from himself the last tie that bound him to children whom he loved ; and to take from her the last prop that stayed her on the path of right , to thrust her down to her ruin .
if she were divorced , he knew she would join her life to vronsky s , and their tie would be an illegitimate and criminal one , since a wife , by the interpretation of the ecclesiastical law , could not marry while her husband was living .
she will join him , and in a year or two he will throw her over , or she will form a new tie , thought alexey alexandrovitch .
and i , by agreeing to an unlawful divorce , shall be to blame for her ruin .
he had thought it all over hundreds of times , and was convinced that a divorce was not at all simple , as stepan arkadyevitch had said , but was utterly impossible .
he did not believe a single word stepan arkadyevitch said to him ; to every word he had a thousand objections to make , but he listened to him , feeling that his words were the expression of that mighty brutal force which controlled his life and to which he would have to submit .
the only question is on what terms you agree to give her a divorce .
she does not want anything , does not dare ask you for anything , she leaves it all to your generosity .
my god , my god !
what for ?
thought alexey alexandrovitch , remembering the details of divorce proceedings in which the husband took the blame on himself , and with just the same gesture with which vronsky had done the same , he hid his face for shame in his hands .
you are distressed , i understand that .
but if you think it over whosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek , turn to him the other also ; and if any man take away thy coat , let him have thy cloak also , thought alexey alexandrovitch .
yes , yes !
he cried in a shrill voice .
i will take the disgrace on myself , i will give up even my son , but but wouldn t it be better to let it alone ?
still you may do as you like and turning away so that his could not see him , he sat down on a chair at the window .
there was bitterness , there was shame in his heart , but with bitterness and shame he felt joy and emotion at the height of his own meekness .
stepan arkadyevitch was touched .
he was silent for a space .
alexey alexandrovitch , believe me , she appreciates your generosity , he said .
but it seems it was the will of god , he added , and as he said it felt how foolish a remark it was , and with difficulty repressed a smile at his own foolishness .
alexey alexandrovitch would have made some reply , but tears stopped him .
this is an unhappy fatality , and one must accept it as such .
i accept the calamity as an accomplished fact , and am doing my best to help both her and you , said stepan arkadyevitch .
when he went out of his s room he was touched , but that did not prevent him from being glad he had successfully brought the matter to a conclusion , for he felt certain alexey alexandrovitch would not go back on his words .
to this satisfaction was added the fact that an idea had just struck him for a riddle turning on his successful achievement , that when the affair was over he would ask his wife and most intimate friends .
he put this riddle into two or three different ways .
but i ll work it out better than that , he said to himself with a smile .
vronsky s wound had been a dangerous one , though it did not touch the heart , and for several days he had lain between life and death .
the first time he was able to speak , varya , his brother s wife , was alone in the room .
varya , he said , looking sternly at her , i shot myself by accident .
and please never speak of it , and tell everyone so .
or else it s too ridiculous .
without answering his words , varya bent over him , and with a delighted smile gazed into his face .
his eyes were clear , not feverish ; but their expression was stern .
thank god !
she said .
you re not in pain ?
a little here .
he pointed to his breast .
then let me change your bandages .
in silence , stiffening his broad jaws , he looked at her while she bandaged him up .
when she had finished he said i m not delirious .
please manage that there may be no talk of my having shot myself on purpose .
no one does say so .
only i hope you won t shoot yourself by accident any more , she said , with a questioning smile .
of course i won t , but it would have been better and he smiled gloomily .
in spite of these words and this smile , which so frightened varya , when the inflammation was over and he began to recover , he felt that he was completely free from one part of his misery .
by his action he had , as it were , washed away the shame and humiliation he had felt before .
he could now think calmly of alexey alexandrovitch .
he recognized all his magnanimity , but he did not now feel himself humiliated by it .
besides , he got back again into the beaten track of his life .
he saw the possibility of looking men in the face again without shame , and he could live in accordance with his own habits .
one thing he could not pluck out of his heart , though he never ceased struggling with it , was the regret , amounting to despair , that he had lost her forever .
that now , having expiated his sin against the husband , he was bound to renounce her , and never in future to stand between her with her repentance and her husband , he had firmly decided in his heart ; but he could not tear out of his heart his regret at the loss of her love , he could not erase from his memory those moments of happiness that he had so little prized at the time , and that haunted him in all their charm .
serpuhovskoy had planned his appointment at tashkend , and vronsky agreed to the proposition without the slightest hesitation .
but the nearer the time of departure came , the bitterer was the sacrifice he was making to what he thought his duty .
his wound had healed , and he was driving about making preparations for his departure for tashkend .
to see her once and then to bury myself , to die , he thought , and as he was paying farewell visits , he uttered this thought to betsy .
charged with this commission , betsy had gone to anna , and brought him back a negative reply .
so much the better , thought vronsky , when he received the news .
it was a weakness , which would have shattered what strength i have left .
next day betsy herself came to him in the morning , and announced that she had heard through oblonsky as a positive fact that alexey alexandrovitch had agreed to a divorce , and that therefore vronsky could see anna .
without even troubling himself to see betsy out of his flat , forgetting all his resolutions , without asking when he could see her , where her husband was , vronsky drove straight to the karenins .
he ran up the stairs seeing no one and nothing , and with a rapid step , almost breaking into a run , he went into her room .
and without considering , without noticing whether there was anyone in the room or not , he flung his arms round her , and began to cover her face , her hands , her neck with kisses .
anna had been preparing herself for this meeting , had thought what she would say to him , but she did not succeed in saying anything of it ; his passion mastered her .
she tried to calm him , to calm herself , but it was too late .
his feeling infected her .
her lips trembled so that for a long while she could say nothing .
yes , you have conquered me , and i am yours , she said at last , pressing his hands to her bosom .
so it had to be , he said .
so long as we live , it must be so .
i know it now .
that s true , she said , getting whiter and whiter , and embracing his head .
still there is something terrible in it after all that has happened .
it will all pass , it will all pass ; we shall be so happy .
our love , if it could be stronger , will be strengthened by there being something terrible in it , he said , lifting his head and parting his strong teeth in a smile .
and she could not but respond with a to his words , but to the love in his eyes .
she took his hand and stroked her chilled cheeks and cropped head with it .
i don t know you with this short hair .
you ve grown so pretty .
a boy .
but how pale you are !
yes , i m very weak , she said , smiling .
and her lips began trembling again .
we ll go to italy ; you will get strong , he said .
can it be possible we could be like husband and wife , alone , your family with you ?
she said , looking close into his eyes .
it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise .
stiva says that has agreed to everything , but i can t accept generosity , she said , looking dreamily past vronsky s face .
i don t want a divorce ; it s all the same to me now .
only i don t know what he will decide about seryozha .
he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could remember and think of her son , of divorce .
what did it all matter ?
don t speak of that , don t think of it , he said , turning her hand in his , and trying to draw her attention to him ; but still she did not look at him .
oh , why didn t i die !
it would have been better , she said , and silent tears flowed down both her cheeks ; but she tried to smile , so as not to wound him .
to decline the flattering and dangerous appointment at tashkend would have been , vronsky had till then considered , disgraceful and impossible .
but now , without an instant s consideration , he declined it , and observing dissatisfaction in the most exalted quarters at this step , he immediately retired from the army .
a month later alexey alexandrovitch was left alone with his son in his house at petersburg , while anna and vronsky had gone abroad , not having obtained a divorce , but having absolutely declined all idea of one .
princess shtcherbatskaya considered that it was out of the question for the wedding to take place before lent , just five weeks off , since not half the trousseau could possibly be ready by that time .
but she could not but agree with levin that to fix it for after lent would be putting it off too late , as an old aunt of prince shtcherbatsky s was seriously ill and might die , and then the mourning would delay the wedding still longer .
and therefore , deciding to divide the trousseau into two larger and smaller princess consented to have the wedding before lent .
she determined that she would get the smaller part of the trousseau all ready now , and the larger part should be made later , and she was much vexed with levin because he was incapable of giving her a serious answer to the question whether he agreed to this arrangement or not .
the arrangement was the more suitable as , immediately after the wedding , the young people were to go to the country , where the more important part of the trousseau would not be wanted .
levin still continued in the same delirious condition in which it seemed to him that he and his happiness constituted the chief and sole aim of all existence , and that he need not now think or care about anything , that everything was being done and would be done for him by others .
he had not even plans and aims for the future , he left its arrangement to others , knowing that everything would be delightful .
his brother sergey ivanovitch , stepan arkadyevitch , and the princess guided him in doing what he had to do .
all he did was to agree entirely with everything suggested to him .
his brother raised money for him , the princess advised him to leave moscow after the wedding .
stepan arkadyevitch advised him to go abroad .
he agreed to everything .
do what you choose , if it amuses you .
i m happy , and my happiness can be no greater and no less for anything you do , he thought .
when he told kitty of stepan arkadyevitch s advice that they should go abroad , he was much surprised that she did not agree to this , and had some definite requirements of her own in regard to their future .
she knew levin had work he loved in the country .
she did not , as he saw , understand this work , she did not even care to understand it .
but that did not prevent her from regarding it as a matter of great importance .
and then she knew their home would be in the country , and she wanted to go , not abroad where she was not going to live , but to the place where their home would be .
this definitely expressed purpose astonished levin .
but since he did not care either way , he immediately asked stepan arkadyevitch , as though it were his duty , to go down to the country and to arrange everything there to the best of his ability with the taste of which he had so much .
but i say , stepan arkadyevitch said to him one day after he had come back from the country , where he had got everything ready for the young people s arrival , have you a certificate of having been at confession ?
no .
but what of it ?
you can t be married without it .
, aïe , aïe ! cried levin .
why , i believe it s nine years since i ve taken the sacrament !
i never thought of it .
you re a pretty fellow !
said stepan arkadyevitch laughing , and you call me a nihilist !
but this won t do , you know .
you must take the sacrament .
when ?
there are four days left now .
stepan arkadyevitch arranged this also , and levin had to go to confession .
to levin , as to any unbeliever who respects the beliefs of others , it was exceedingly disagreeable to be present at and take part in church ceremonies .
at this moment , in his present softened state of feeling , sensitive to everything , this inevitable act of hypocrisy was not merely painful to levin , it seemed to him utterly impossible .
now , in the heyday of his highest glory , his fullest flower , he would have to be a liar or a scoffer .
he felt incapable of being either .
but though he repeatedly plied stepan arkadyevitch with questions as to the possibility of obtaining a certificate without actually communicating , stepan arkadyevitch maintained that it was out of the question .
besides , what is it to days ?
and he s an awfully nice clever old fellow .
he ll pull the tooth out for you so gently , you won t notice it .
standing at the first litany , levin attempted to revive in himself his youthful recollections of the intense religious emotion he had passed through between the ages of sixteen and seventeen .
but he was at once convinced that it was utterly impossible to him .
he attempted to look at it all as an empty custom , having no sort of meaning , like the custom of paying calls .
but he felt that he could not do that either .
levin found himself , like the majority of his contemporaries , in the vaguest position in regard to religion .
believe he could not , and at the same time he had no firm conviction that it was all wrong .
and consequently , not being able to believe in the significance of what he was doing nor to regard it with indifference as an empty formality , during the whole period of preparing for the sacrament he was conscious of a feeling of discomfort and shame at doing what he did not himself understand , and what , as an inner voice told him , was therefore false and wrong .
during the service he would first listen to the prayers , trying to attach some meaning to them not discordant with his own views ; then feeling that he could not understand and must condemn them , he tried not to listen to them , but to attend to the thoughts , observations , and memories which floated through his brain with extreme vividness during this idle time of standing in church .
he had stood through the litany , the evening service and the midnight service , and the next day he got up earlier than usual , and without having tea went at eight o clock in the morning to the church for the morning service and the confession .
there was no one in the church but a beggar soldier , two old women , and the church officials .
a young deacon , whose long back showed in two distinct halves through his thin undercassock , met him , and at once going to a little table at the wall read the exhortation .
during the reading , especially at the frequent and rapid repetition of the same words , lord , have mercy on us !
which resounded with an echo , levin felt that thought was shut and sealed up , and that it must not be touched or stirred now or confusion would be the result ; and so standing behind the deacon he went on thinking of his own affairs , neither listening nor examining what was said .
it s wonderful what expression there is in her hand , he thought , remembering how they had been sitting the day before at a corner table .
they had nothing to talk about , as was almost always the case at this time , and laying her hand on the table she kept opening and shutting it , and laughed herself as she watched her action .
he remembered how he had kissed it and then had examined the lines on the pink palm .
have mercy on us again !
thought levin , crossing himself , bowing , and looking at the supple spring of the deacon s back bowing before him .
she took my hand then and examined the lines you ve got a splendid hand , she said .
and he looked at his own hand and the short hand of the deacon .
yes , now it will soon be over , he thought .
no , it seems to be beginning again , he thought , listening to the prayers .
no , it s just ending there he is bowing down to the ground .
that s always at the end .
the deacon s hand in a plush cuff accepted a note unobtrusively , and the deacon said he would put it down in the register , and his new boots creaking jauntily over the flagstones of the empty church , he went to the altar .
a moment later he peeped out thence and beckoned to levin .
thought , till then locked up , began to stir in levin s head , but he made haste to drive it away .
it will come right somehow , he thought , and went towards the .
he went up the steps , and turning to the right saw the priest .
the priest , a little old man with a scanty grizzled beard and weary , eyes , was standing at the , turning over the pages of a missal .
with a slight bow to levin he began immediately reading prayers in the official voice .
when he had finished them he bowed down to the ground and turned , facing levin .
christ is present here unseen , receiving your confession , he said , pointing to the crucifix .
do you believe in all the doctrines of the holy apostolic church ?
the priest went on , turning his eyes away from levin s face and folding his hands under his stole .
i have doubted , i doubt everything , said levin in a voice that jarred on himself , and he ceased speaking .
the priest waited a few seconds to see if he would not say more , and closing his eyes he said quickly , with a broad , vladimirsky accent doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind , but we must pray that god in his mercy will strengthen us .
what are your special sins ?
he added , without the slightest interval , as though anxious not to waste time .
my chief sin is doubt .
i have doubts of everything , and for the most part i am in doubt .
doubt is natural to the weakness of mankind , the priest repeated the same words .
what do you doubt about principally ?
i doubt of everything .
i sometimes even have doubts of the existence of god , levin could not help saying , and he was horrified at the impropriety of what he was saying .
but levin s words did not , it seemed , make much impression on the priest .
what sort of doubt can there be of the existence of god ?
he said hurriedly , with a just perceptible smile .
levin did not speak .
what doubt can you have of the creator when you behold his creation ?
the priest went on in the rapid customary jargon .
who has decked the heavenly firmament with its lights ?
who has clothed the earth in its beauty ?
how explain it without the creator ?
he said , looking inquiringly at levin .
levin felt that it would be improper to enter upon a metaphysical discussion with the priest , and so he said in reply merely what was a direct answer to the question .
i don t know , he said .
you don t know !
then how can you doubt that god created all ?
the priest said , with perplexity .
i don t understand it at all , said levin , blushing , and feeling that his words were stupid , and that they could not be anything but stupid in such a position .
pray to god and beseech him .
even the holy fathers had doubts , and prayed to god to strengthen their faith .
the devil has great power , and we must resist him .
pray to god , beseech him .
pray to god , he repeated hurriedly .
the priest paused for some time , as though meditating .
you re about , i hear , to marry the daughter of my parishioner and son in the spirit , prince shtcherbatsky ?
he resumed , with a smile .
an excellent young lady .
yes , answered levin , blushing for the priest .
what does he want to ask me about this at confession for ?
he thought .
and , as though answering his thought , the priest said to him you are about to enter into holy matrimony , and god may bless you with offspring .
well , what sort of can you give your babes if you do not overcome the temptation of the devil , enticing you to infidelity ?
he said , with gentle reproachfulness .
if you love your child as a good father , you will not desire only wealth , luxury , honor for your infant ; you will be anxious for his salvation , his spiritual enlightenment with the light of truth .
eh ?
what answer will you make him when the innocent babe asks you papa !
who made all that enchants me in this earth , the waters , the sun , the flowers , the grass ? can you say to him i don t know ?
you can not but know , since the lord god in his infinite mercy has revealed it to us .
or your child will ask you what awaits me in the life beyond the tomb ? what will you say to him when you know nothing ?
how will you answer him ?
will you leave him to the allurements of the world and the devil ?
that s not right , he said , and he stopped , putting his head on one side and looking at levin with his kindly , gentle eyes .
levin made no answer this time , not because he did not want to enter upon a discussion with the priest , but because , so far , no one had ever asked him such questions , and when his babes did ask him those questions , it would be time enough to think about answering them .
you are entering upon a time of life , pursued the priest , when you must choose your path and keep to it .
pray to god that he may in his mercy aid you and have mercy on you !
he concluded .
our lord and god , jesus christ , in the abundance and riches of his lovingkindness , forgives this child and , finishing the prayer of absolution , the priest blessed him and dismissed him .
on getting home that day , levin had a delightful sense of relief at the awkward position being over and having been got through without his having to tell a lie .
apart from this , there remained a vague memory that what the kind , nice old fellow had said had not been at all so stupid as he had fancied at first , and that there was something in it that must be cleared up .
of course , not now , thought levin , but some day later on .
levin felt more than ever now that there was something not clear and not clean in his soul , and that , in regard to religion , he was in the same position which he perceived so clearly and disliked in others , and for which he blamed his friend sviazhsky .
levin spent that evening with his betrothed at dolly s , and was in very high spirits .
to explain to stepan arkadyevitch the state of excitement in which he found himself , he said that he was happy like a dog being trained to jump through a hoop , who , having at last caught the idea , and done what was required of him , whines and wags its tail , and jumps up to the table and the windows in its delight .
on the day of the wedding , according to the russian custom ( the princess and darya alexandrovna insisted on strictly keeping all the customs ) , levin did not see his betrothed , and dined at his hotel with three bachelor friends , casually brought together at his rooms .
these were sergey ivanovitch , katavasov , a university friend , now professor of natural science , whom levin had met in the street and insisted on taking home with him , and tchirikov , his best man , a moscow judge , levin s companion in his .
the dinner was a very merry one sergey ivanovitch was in his happiest mood , and was much amused by katavasov s originality .
katavasov , feeling his originality was appreciated and understood , made the most of it .
tchirikov always gave a lively and support to conversation of any sort .
see , now , said katavasov , drawling his words from a habit acquired in the , what a capable fellow was our friend konstantin dmitrievitch .
i m not speaking of present company , for he s absent .
at the time he left the university he was fond of science , took an interest in humanity ; now of his abilities is devoted to deceiving himself , and the other to justifying the deceit .
a more determined enemy of matrimony than you i never saw , said sergey ivanovitch .
oh , no , i m not an enemy of matrimony .
i m in favor of division of labor .
people who can do nothing else ought to rear people while the rest work for their happiness and enlightenment .
that s how i look at it .
to muddle up two trades is the error of the amateur ; i m not one of their number .
how happy i shall be when i hear that you re in love !
said levin .
please invite me to the wedding .
i m in love now .
yes , with a cuttlefish !
you know , levin turned to his brother , mihail semyonovitch is writing a work on the digestive organs of the now , make a muddle of it !
it doesn t matter what about .
and the fact is , i certainly do love cuttlefish .
but that s no hindrance to your loving your wife .
the cuttlefish is no hindrance .
the wife is the hindrance .
why so ?
oh , you ll see !
you care about farming , hunting , , you d better look out !
arhip was here today ; he said there were a lot of elks in prudno , and two bears , said tchirikov .
well , you must go and get them without me .
ah , that s the truth , said sergey ivanovitch .
and you may say to for the wife won t allow it !
levin smiled .
the picture of his wife not letting him go was so pleasant that he was ready to renounce the delights of looking upon bears forever .
still , it s a pity they should get those two bears without you .
do you remember last time at hapilovo ?
that was a delightful hunt !
said tchirikov .
levin had not the heart to disillusion him of the notion that there could be something delightful apart from her , and so said nothing .
there s some sense in this custom of saying to bachelor life , said sergey ivanovitch .
however happy you may be , you must regret your freedom .
and confess there is a feeling that you want to jump out of the window , like gogol s bridegroom ?
of course there is , but it isn t confessed , said katavasov , and he broke into loud laughter .
oh , well , the window s open .
let s start off this instant to tver !
there s a big ; one can go right up to the lair .
seriously , let s go by the five o clock !
and here let them do what they like , said tchirikov , smiling .
well , now , on my honor , said levin , smiling , i can t find in my heart that feeling of regret for my freedom .
yes , there s such a chaos in your heart just now that you can t find anything there , said katavasov .
wait a bit , when you set it to rights a little , you ll find it !
no ; if so , i should have felt a little , apart from my feeling ( he could not say love before them ) and happiness , a certain regret at losing my freedom on the contrary , i am glad at the very loss of my freedom .
awful !
it s a hopeless case !
said katavasov .
well , let s drink to his recovery , or wish that a hundredth part of his dreams may be that would be happiness such as never has been seen on earth !
soon after dinner the guests went away to be in time to be dressed for the wedding .
when he was left alone , and recalled the conversation of these bachelor friends , levin asked himself had he in his heart that regret for his freedom of which they had spoken ?
he smiled at the question .
freedom !
what is freedom for ?
happiness is only in loving and wishing her wishes , thinking her thoughts , that is to say , not freedom at s happiness !
but do i know her ideas , her wishes , her feelings ?
some voice suddenly whispered to him .
the smile died away from his face , and he grew thoughtful .
and suddenly a strange feeling came upon him .
there came over him a dread and of everything .
what if she does not love me ?
what if she s marrying me simply to be married ?
what if she doesn t see herself what she s doing ?
he asked himself .
she may come to her senses , and only when she is being married realize that she does not and can not love me .
and strange , most evil thoughts of her began to come to him .
he was jealous of vronsky , as he had been a year ago , as though the evening he had seen her with vronsky had been yesterday .
he suspected she had not told him everything .
he jumped up quickly .
