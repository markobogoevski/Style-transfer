pride , ' says the peacock mistress , that you know .
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse now , out of doubt antipholus is mad , else would he never so demean himself .
a ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats , and for the same he promised me a chain both one and other he denies me now .
the reason that i gather he is mad , besides this present instance of his rage , is a mad tale he told at dinner , of his own doors being shut against his entrance .
belike his wife , acquainted with his fits , on purpose shut the doors against his way .
my way is now to hie home to his house , and tell his wife that , being lunatic , he rush into my house and took perforce my ring away .
this course i fittest choose , for forty ducats is too much to lose .
exit scene iv .
a street .
enter antipholus of ephesus and the officer antipholus fear me not , man , i will not break away i give thee , ere i leave thee , so much money , to warrant thee , as i am for .
my wife is in a wayward mood , and will not lightly trust the messenger that i should be attach in ephesus , i tell you , sound harshly in her ears .
enter dromio of ephesus with a here comes my man , i think he brings the money .
how now , sir !
have you that i sent you for ?
here that , i warrant you , will pay them all .
antipholus but where the money ?
why , sir , i gave the money for the rope .
antipholus five hundred ducats , villain , for a rope ?
i serve you , sir , five hundred at the rate .
antipholus to what end did i bid thee hie thee home ?
to a , sir , and to that end am i returned .
antipholus and to that end , sir , i will welcome you .
beating him good sir , be patient .
nay , is for me to be patient , i am in adversity .
good , now , hold thy tongue .
nay , rather persuade him to hold his hands .
antipholus thou whoreson , senseless villain !
i would i were senseless , sir , that i might not feel your blows .
thou art sensible in nothing but blows , and so is an ass .
i am an ass , indeed , you may prove it by my long ears .
i have served him from the hour of my nativity to this instant , and have nothing at his hands for my service but blows .
when i am cold , he heats me with beating , when i am warm , he cools me with beating , i am waked with it when i sleep , raised with it when i sit , driven out of doors with it when i go from home , welcomed home with it when i return , nay , i bear it on my shoulders , as a beggar wont her brat , and , i think when he hath lamed me , i shall beg with it from door to door .
antipholus come , go along , my wife is coming yonder .
enter adriana , luciana , the courtezan , and pinch mistress , finem , ' respect your end , or rather , the prophecy like the parrot , the . '
antipholus wilt thou still talk ?
beating him how say you now ?
is not your husband mad ?
his incivility confirms no less .
good doctor pinch , you are a conjurer , establish him in his true sense again , and i will please you what you will demand .
alas , how fiery and how sharp he looks !
mark how he trembles in his ecstasy !
give me your hand and let me feel your pulse .
antipholus there is my hand , and let it feel your ear .
striking him i charge thee , satan , housed within this man , to yield possession to my holy prayers and to thy state of darkness hie thee straight i conjure thee by all the saints in heaven !
antipholus peace , doting wizard , peace !
i am not mad .
o , that thou wert not , poor distressed soul !
antipholus you minion , you , are these your customers ?
did this companion with the saffron face revel and feast it at my house , whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut and i denied to enter in my house ?
o husband , god doth know you dined at home , where would you had remain until this time , free from these slanders and this open shame !
antipholus dined at home !
thou villain , what sayest thou ?
sir , sooth to say , you did not dine at home .
antipholus were not my doors lock up and i shut out ?
perdie , your doors were lock and you shut out .
antipholus and did not she herself revile me there ?
sans fable , she herself reviled you there .
antipholus did not her rail , taunt , and scorn me ?
certes , she did , the scorn you .
antipholus and did not i in rage depart from thence ?
in verity you did , my bones bear witness , that since have felt the vigour of his rage .
good to soothe him in these contraries ?
it is no shame the fellow finds his vein , and yielding to him humours well his frenzy .
antipholus thou hast suborn the goldsmith to arrest me .
alas , i sent you money to redeem you , by dromio here , who came in haste for it .
money by me !
heart and goodwill you might , but surely master , not a rag of money .
antipholus not thou to her for a purse of ducats ?
he came to me and i deliver it .
and i am witness with her that she did .
god and the bear me witness that i was sent for nothing but a rope !
mistress , both man and master is possess , i know it by their pale and deadly looks they must be bound and laid in some dark room .
antipholus say , wherefore didst thou lock me forth ?
and why dost thou deny the bag of gold ?
i did not , gentle husband , lock thee forth .
and , gentle master , i received no gold , but i confess , sir , that we were lock out .
dissembling villain , thou false in both .
antipholus dissembling harlot , thou art false in all , and art confederate with a damned pack to make a loathsome abject scorn of me but with these nails i pluck out these false eyes that would behold in me this shameful sport .
enter three or four , and offer to bind him .
he strives o , bind him , bind him !
let him not come near me .
more company !
the fiend is strong within him .
ay me , poor man , how pale and wan he looks !
antipholus what , will you murder me ?
thou gaoler , thou , i am thy prisoner wilt thou suffer them to make a rescue ?
masters , let him go he is my prisoner , and you shall not have him .
go bind this man , for he is frantic too .
they offer to bind dromio of ephesus what wilt thou do , thou peevish officer ?
hast thou delight to see a wretched man do outrage and displeasure to himself ?
he is my prisoner if i let him go , the debt he owes will be required of me .
i will discharge thee ere i go from thee bear me forthwith unto his creditor , and , knowing how the debt grows , i will pay it .
good master doctor , see him safe convey home to my house .
o most unhappy day !
antipholus o most unhappy strumpet !
master , i am here entered in bond for you .
antipholus out on thee , villain !
wherefore dost thou mad me ?
will you be bound for nothing ?
be mad , good master cry devil ! '
god help , poor souls , how idly do they talk !
go bear him hence .
sister , go you with me .
exeunt all but adriana , luciana , officer and courtezan say now , whose suit is he arrested at ?
one angelo , a goldsmith do you know him ?
i know the man .
what is the sum he owes ?
two hundred ducats .
say , how grows it due ?
due for a chain your husband had of him .
he did bespeak a chain for me , but had it not .
when as your husband all in rage came to my house and took away my ring the ring i saw upon his finger now straight after did i meet him with a chain .
it may be so , but i did never see it .
come , gaoler , bring me where the goldsmith is i long to know the truth hereof at large .
enter antipholus of syracuse with his rapier drawn , and dromio of syracuse god , for thy mercy !
they are loose again .
and come with naked swords .
let call more help to have them bound again .
away !
they kill us .
exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse antipholus i see these witches are afraid of swords .
she that would be your wife now ran from you .
antipholus come to the centaur , fetch our stuff from thence i long that we were safe and sound aboard .
faith , stay here this night , they will surely do us no harm you saw they speak us fair , give us gold methinks they are such a gentle nation that , but for the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of me , i could find in my heart to stay here still and turn witch .
antipholus i will not stay for all the town , therefore away , to get our stuff aboard .
exeunt act v scene i .
a street before a priory .
enter second merchant and angelo i am sorry , sir , that i have hinder you , but , i protest , he had the chain of me , though most dishonestly he doth deny it .
how is the man esteemed here in the city ?
of very reverend reputation , sir , of credit infinite , highly beloved , second to none that lives here in the city his word might bear my wealth at any time .
speak softly , yonder , as i think , he walks .
enter antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse is so , and that self chain about his neck which he forswore most monstrously to have .
good sir , draw near to me , i speak to him .
signior antipholus , i wonder much that you would put me to this shame and trouble , and , not without some scandal to yourself , with circumstance and oaths so to deny this chain which now you wear so openly beside the charge , the shame , imprisonment , you have done wrong to this my honest friend , who , but for staying on our controversy , had hoisted sail and put to sea this chain you had of me , can you deny it ?
antipholus i think i had , i never did deny it .
yes , that you did , sir , and forswore it too .
antipholus who heard me to deny it or forswear it ?
these ears of mine , thou did hear thee .
fie on thee , wretch !
is pity that thou livest to walk where any honest man resort .
antipholus thou art a villain to impeach me thus i prove mine honour and mine honesty against thee presently , if thou darest stand .
i dare , and do defy thee for a villain .
they draw enter adriana , luciana , the courtezan , and others hold , hurt him not , for god sake !
he is mad .
some get within him , take his sword away bind dromio too , and bear them to my house .
run , master , run , for god sake , take a house !
this is some priory .
in , or we are spoil !
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse to the priory enter the lady abbess , aemilia be quiet , people .
wherefore throng you hither ?
to fetch my poor distracted husband hence .
let us come in , that we may bind him fast and bear him home for his recovery .
i knew he was not in his perfect wits .
i am sorry now that i did draw on him .
how long hath this possession held the man ?
this week he hath been heavy , sour , sad , and much different from the man he was , but till this afternoon his passion brake into extremity of rage .
hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea ?
buried some dear friend ?
hath not else his eye stray his affection in unlawful love ?
a sin prevailing much in youthful men , who give their eyes the liberty of gazing .
which of these sorrows is he subject to ?
to none of these , except it be the last , namely , some love that drew him oft from home .
you should for that have reprehended him .
why , so i did .
ay , but not rough enough .
as roughly as my modesty would let me .
haply , in private .
and in assemblies too .
ay , but not enough .
it was the copy of our conference in bed he slept not for my urging it , at board he fed not for my urging it , alone , it was the subject of my theme , in company i often glanced it , still did i tell him it was vile and bad .
and thereof came it that the man was mad .
the venom clamours of a jealous woman poisons more deadly than a mad dog tooth .
it seems his sleeps were hinder by thy railing , and therefore comes it that his head is light .
thou his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings unquiet meals make ill digestions , thereof the raging fire of fever bred , and what a fever but a fit of madness ?
thou his sports were hinderd by thy brawls sweet recreation barr , what doth ensue but moody and dull melancholy , kinsman to grim and comfortless despair , and at her heels a huge infectious troop of pale distemperatures and foes to life ?
in food , in sport and rest to be disturb , would mad or man or beast the consequence is then thy jealous fits have scared thy husband from the use of wits .
she never reprehended him but mildly , when he demean himself rough , rude and wildly .
why bear you these rebukes and answer not ?
she did betray me to my own reproof .
good people enter and lay hold on him .
no , not a creature enters in my house .
then let your servants bring my husband forth .
neither he took this place for sanctuary , and it shall privilege him from your hands till i have brought him to his wits again , or lose my labour in assaying it .
i will attend my husband , be his nurse , diet his sickness , for it is my office , and will have no attorney but myself , and therefore let me have him home with me .
be patient , for i will not let him stir till i have used the approved means i have , with wholesome syrups , drugs and holy prayers , to make of him a formal man again it is a branch and parcel of mine oath , a charitable duty of my order .
therefore depart and leave him here with me .
i will not hence and leave my husband here and ill it doth beseem your holiness to separate the husband and the wife .
be quiet and depart thou shalt not have him .
exit complain unto the duke of this indignity .
come , go i will fall prostrate at his feet and never rise until my tears and prayers have won his grace to come in person hither and take perforce my husband from the abbess .
by this , i think , the dial points at five anon , i sure , the duke himself in person comes this way to the melancholy vale , the place of death and sorry execution , behind the ditches of the abbey here .
upon what cause ?
to see a reverend syracusian merchant , who put unluckily into this bay against the laws and statutes of this town , beheaded publicly for his offence .
see where they come we will behold his death .
kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey .
enter duke solinus , attended , aegeon bareheaded , with the headsman and other officers yet once again proclaim it publicly , if any friend will pay the sum for him , he shall not die , so much we tender him .
justice , most sacred duke , against the abbess !
she is a virtuous and a reverend lady it can not be that she hath done thee wrong .
may it please your grace , antipholus , my husband , whom i made lord of me and all i had , at your important letters , this ill day a most outrageous fit of madness took him , that desperately he hurried through the street , with him his bondman , all as mad as he doing displeasure to the citizens by rushing in their houses , bearing thence rings , jewels , any thing his rage did like .
once did i get him bound and sent him home , whilst to take order for the wrongs i went , that here and there his fury had committed .
anon , i wot not by what strong escape , he broke from those that had the guard of him , and with his mad attendant and himself , each one with ireful passion , with drawn swords , met us again and madly bent on us , chased us away , till , raising of more aid , we came again to bind them .
then they fled into this abbey , whither we pursued them and here the abbess shuts the gates on us and will not suffer us to fetch him out , nor send him forth that we may bear him hence .
therefore , most gracious duke , with thy command let him be brought forth and borne hence for help .
long since thy husband served me in my wars , and i to thee engaged a prince word , when thou didst make him master of thy bed , to do him all the grace and good i could .
go , some of you , knock at the and bid the lady abbess come to me .
i will determine this before i stir .
enter a servant o mistress , mistress , shift and save yourself !
my master and his man are both broke loose , beaten the maids and bound the doctor whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire , and ever , as it blazed , they threw on him great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair my master preaches patience to him and the while his man with scissors nicks him like a fool , and sure , unless you send some present help , between them they will kill the conjurer .
peace , fool !
thy master and his man are here , and that is false thou dost report to us .
mistress , upon my life , i tell you true , i have not breathed almost since i did see it .
he cries for you , and vows , if he can take you , to scorch your face and to disfigure you .
cry within hark , hark !
i hear him , mistress .
fly , be gone !
come , stand by me , fear nothing .
guard with halberds !
ay me , it is my husband !
witness you , that he is borne about invisible even now we housed him in the abbey here , and now he there , past thought of human reason .
enter antipholus of ephesus and dromio of ephesus antipholus justice , most gracious duke , o , grant me justice !
even for the service that long since i did thee , when i bestrid thee in the wars and took deep scars to save thy life , even for the blood that then i lost for thee , now grant me justice .
unless the fear of death doth make me dote , i see my son antipholus and dromio .
antipholus justice , sweet prince , against that woman there !
she whom thou gavest to me to be my wife , that hath abused and dishonour me even in the strength and height of injury !
beyond imagination is the wrong that she this day hath shameless thrown on me .
discover how , and thou shalt find me just .
antipholus this day , great duke , she shut the doors upon me , while she with harlots feasted in my house .
a grievous fault !
say , woman , didst thou so ?
no , my good lord myself , he and my sister did dine together .
so befall my soul as this is false he burdens me withal !
may i look on day , nor sleep on night , but she tells to your highness simple truth !
o perjured woman !
they are both forsworn in this the madman justly chargeth them .
antipholus my liege , i am advised what i say , neither disturbed with the effect of wine , nor , provoked with raging ire , albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad .
this woman lock me out this day from dinner that goldsmith there , were he not pack with her , could witness it , for he was with me then , who parted with me to go fetch a chain , promising to bring it to the porpentine , where balthazar and i did dine together .
our dinner done , and he not coming thither , i went to seek him in the street i met him and in his company that gentleman .
there did this perjured goldsmith swear me down that i this day of him received the chain , which , god he knows , i saw not for the which he did arrest me with an officer .
i did obey , and sent my peasant home for certain ducats he with none return then fairly i bespoke the officer to go in person with me to my house .
by the way we met my wife , her sister , and a rabble more of vile confederates .
along with them they brought one pinch , a hungry villain , a mere anatomy , a mountebank , a threadbare juggler and a , a needy , , wretch , a man this pernicious slave , forsooth , took on him as a conjurer , and , gazing in mine eyes , feeling my pulse , and with no face , as , outfacing me , cries out , i was possess .
then all together they fell upon me , bound me , bore me thence and in a dark and dankish vault at home there left me and my man , both bound together , till , gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder , i gain my freedom , and immediately ran hither to your grace , whom i beseech to give me ample satisfaction for these deep shames and great indignities .
my lord , in truth , thus far i witness with him , that he dined not at home , but was lock out .
but had he such a chain of thee or no ?
he had , my lord and when he ran in here , these people saw the chain about his neck .
besides , i will be sworn these ears of mine heard you confess you had the chain of him after you first forswore it on the mart and thereupon i drew my sword on you , and then you fled into this abbey here , from whence , i think , you are come by miracle .
antipholus i never came within these , nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me i never saw the chain , so help me heaven !
and this is false you burden me withal .
why , what an intricate impeach is this !
i think you all have drunk of circe cup .
if here you housed him , here he would have been , if he were mad , he would not plead so coldly you say he dined at home , the goldsmith here denies that saying .
sirrah , what say you ?
sir , he dined with her there , at the porpentine .
he did , and from my finger snatch that ring .
antipholus is true , my liege , this ring i had of her .
thou him enter at the abbey here ?
as sure , my liege , as i do see your grace .
why , this is strange .
go call the abbess hither .
i think you are all mated or stark mad .
exit one to abbess most mighty duke , vouchsafe me speak a word haply i see a friend will save my life and pay the sum that may deliver me .
speak freely , syracusian , what thou wilt .
is not your name , sir , call antipholus ?
and is not that your bondman , dromio ?
within this hour i was his bondman sir , but he , i thank him , gnaw in two my cords now am i dromio and his man unbound .
i am sure you both of you remember me .
ourselves we do remember , sir , by you , for lately we were bound , as you are now you are not pinch patient , are you , sir ?
why look you strange on me ?
you know me well .
i never saw you in my life till now .
o , grief hath changed me since you saw me last , and careful hours with time deformed hand have written strange defeatures in my face but tell me yet , dost thou not know my voice ?
antipholus neither .
dromio , nor thou ?
no , trust me , sir , nor i .
i am sure thou dost .
ay , sir , but i am sure i do not , and whatsoever a man denies , you are now bound to believe him .
not know my voice !
o time extremity , hast thou so crack and splitted my poor tongue in seven short years , that here my only son knows not my feeble key of untuned cares ?
though now this grained face of mine be hid in winter drizzled snow , and all the conduits of my blood froze up , yet hath my night of life some memory , my wasting lamps some fading glimmer left , my dull deaf ears a little use to hear all these old witnesses i can not err tell me thou art my son antipholus .
antipholus i never saw my father in my life .
but seven years since , in syracusa , boy , thou we parted but perhaps , my son , thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery .
antipholus the duke and all that know me in the city can witness with me that it is not so i saw syracusa in my life .
i tell thee , syracusian , twenty years have i been patron to antipholus , during which time he saw syracusa i see thy age and dangers make thee dote .
aemilia , with antipholus of syracuse and dromio of syracuse most mighty duke , behold a man much wrong .
all gather to see them i see two husbands , or mine eyes deceive me .
one of these men is genius to the other , and so of these .
which is the natural man , and which the spirit ?
who deciphers them ?
i , sir , am dromio , command him away .
i , sir , am dromio , pray , let me stay .
antipholus aegeon art thou not ?
or else his ghost ?
o , my old master !
who hath bound him here ?
whoever bound him , i will loose his bonds and gain a husband by his liberty .
speak , old aegeon , if thou the man that hadst a wife once call aemilia that bore thee at a burden two fair sons o , if thou the same aegeon , speak , and speak unto the same aemilia !
if i dream not , thou art aemilia if thou art she , tell me where is that son that floated with thee on the fatal raft ?
by men of epidamnum he and i and the twin dromio all were taken up , but by and by rude fishermen of corinth by force took dromio and my son from them and me they left with those of epidamnum .
what then became of them i can not tell i to this fortune that you see me in .
why , here begins his morning story right , these two antipholuses , these two so like , and these two dromios , one in semblance , besides her urging of her wreck at sea , these are the parents to these children , which accidentally are met together .
antipholus , thou camest from corinth first ?
antipholus no , sir , not i , i came from syracuse .
stay , stand apart , i know not which is which .
antipholus i came from corinth , my most gracious lord , and i with him .
antipholus brought to this town by that most famous warrior , duke menaphon , your most renowned uncle .
which of you two did dine with me ?
antipholus i , gentle mistress .
and are not you my husband ?
antipholus no , i say nay to that .
antipholus and so do i , yet did she call me so and this fair gentlewoman , her sister here , did call me brother .
to luciana what i told you then , i hope i shall have leisure to make good , if this be not a dream i see and hear .
that is the chain , sir , which you had of me .
antipholus i think it be , sir , i deny it not .
antipholus and you , sir , for this chain arrested me .
i think i did , sir , i deny it not .
i sent you money , sir , to be your bail , by dromio , but i think he brought it not .
no , none by me .
antipholus this purse of ducats i received from you , and dromio , my man , did bring them me .
i see we still did meet each other man , and i was for him , and he for me , and thereupon these errors are arose .
antipholus these ducats pawn i for my father here .
it shall not need , thy father hath his life .
sir , i must have that diamond from you .
antipholus there , take it , and much thanks for my good cheer .
renowned duke , vouchsafe to take the pains to go with us into the abbey here and hear at large discoursed all our fortunes and all that are assembled in this place , that by this sympathized one day error have suffer wrong , go keep us company , and we shall make full satisfaction .
years have i but gone in travail of you , my sons , and till this present hour my heavy burden delivered .
the duke , my husband and my children both , and you the calendars of their nativity , go to a gossips ' feast and go with me , after so long grief , such festivity !
with all my heart , i gossip at this feast .
exeunt all but antipholus of syracuse , antipholus of ephesus , dromio of syracuse and dromio of ephesus master , shall i fetch your stuff from shipboard ?
antipholus dromio , what stuff of mine hast thou embark ?
your goods that lay at host , sir , in the centaur .
antipholus he speaks to me .
i am your master , dromio come , go with us , we look to that anon embrace thy brother there , rejoice with him .
exeunt antipholus of syracuse and antipholus of ephesus there is a fat friend at your master house , that kitchen me for you at dinner she now shall be my sister , not my wife .
methinks you are my glass , and not my brother i see by you i am a youth .
will you walk in to see their gossiping ?
not i , sir , you are my elder .
that a question how shall we try it ?
we draw cuts for the senior till then lead thou first .
nay , then , thus we came into the world like brother and brother , and now let go hand in hand , not one before another .
exeunt act i scene rome .
a street .
enter a company of mutinous citizens , with staves , clubs , and other weapons before we proceed any further , hear me speak .
speak , speak .
you are all resolved rather to die than to famish ?
resolved .
resolved .
first , you know caius marcius is chief enemy to the people .
we , we .
let us kill him , and we have corn at our own price .
a verdict ?
no more talking o , let it be done away , away !
one word , good citizens .
we are accounted poor citizens , the patricians good .
what authority surfeits on would relieve us if they would yield us but the superfluity , while it were wholesome , we might guess they relieved us humanely , but they think we are too dear the leanness that afflicts us , the object of our misery , is as an inventory to particularise their abundance , our sufferance is a gain to them let us revenge this with our pikes , ere we become rakes for the gods know i speak this in hunger for bread , not in thirst for revenge .
would you proceed especially against caius marcius ?
against him first he a very dog to the commonalty .
consider you what services he has done for his country ?
very well , and could be content to give him good report fort , but that he pays himself with being proud .
nay , but speak not maliciously .
i say unto you , what he hath done famously , he did it to that end though men can be content to say it was for his country he did it to please his mother and to be partly proud , which he is , even till the altitude of his virtue .
what he can not help in his nature , you account a vice in him .
you must in no way say he is covetous .
if i must not , i need not be barren of accusations , he hath faults , with surplus , to tire in repetition .
shouts within what shouts are these ?
the other side o ' the city is risen why stay we prating here ?
to the capitol !
come , come .
soft !
who comes here ?
enter menenius agrippa worthy menenius agrippa , one that hath always loved the people .
he one honest enough would all the rest were so !
what work , my countrymen , in hand ?
where go you with bats and clubs ?
the matter ?
speak , i pray you .
our business is not unknown to the senate , they have had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do , which now we show in deeds .
they say poor suitors have strong breaths they shall know we have strong arms too .
why , masters , my good friends , mine honest neighbours , will you undo yourselves ?
we can not , sir , we are undone already .
i tell you , friends , most charitable care have the patricians of you .
for your wants , your suffering in this dearth , you may as well strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them against the roman state , whose course will on the way it takes , cracking ten thousand curbs of more strong link asunder than can ever appear in your impediment .
for the dearth , the gods , not the patricians , make it , and your knees to them , not arms , must help .
alack , you are transported by calamity thither where more attends you , and you slander the helms o ' the state , who care for you like fathers , when you curse them as enemies .
care for us !
true , indeed !
they cared for us yet suffer us to famish , and their crammed with grain , make edicts for usury , to support usurers , repeal daily any wholesome act established against the rich , and provide more piercing statutes daily , to chain up and restrain the poor .
if the wars eat us not up , they will , and there all the love they bear us .
either you must confess yourselves wondrous malicious , or be accused of folly .
i shall tell you a pretty tale it may be you have heard it , but , since it serves my purpose , i will venture to stale a little more .
well , i hear it , sir yet you must not think to fob off our disgrace with a tale but , an please you , deliver .
there was a time when all the body members rebell against the belly , thus accused it that only like a gulf it did remain i ' the midst o ' the body , idle and unactive , still cupboarding the viand , never bearing like labour with the rest , where the other instruments did see and hear , devise , instruct , walk , feel , and , mutually participate , did minister unto the appetite and affection common of the whole body .
the belly answer well , sir , what answer made the belly ?
sir , i shall tell you .
with a kind of smile , which came from the lungs , but even thus for , look you , i may make the belly smile as well as speak it tauntingly replied to the discontented members , the mutinous parts that envied his receipt , even so most fitly as you malign our senators for that they are not such as you .
your belly answer ?
what !
the head , the vigilant eye , the counsellor heart , the arm our soldier , our steed the leg , the tongue our trumpeter .
with other muniments and petty helps in this our fabric , if that they what then ?
me , this fellow speaks !
what then ?
what then ?
should by the cormorant belly be restrain , who is the sink o ' the body , well , what then ?
the former agents , if they did complain , what could the belly answer ?
i will tell you if you bestow a small of what you have little patience awhile , you hear the belly answer .
ye long about it .
note me this , good friend , your most grave belly was deliberate , not rash like his accusers , and thus answer is it , my incorporate friends , ' quoth he , i receive the general food at first , which you do live upon , and fit it is , because i am the and the shop of the whole body but , if you do remember , i send it through the rivers of your blood , even to the court , the heart , to the seat o ' the brain , and , through the cranks and offices of man , the strongest nerves and small inferior veins from me receive that natural competency whereby they live and though that all at once , you , my good friends , ' this says the belly , mark me , ay , sir , well , well .
all at once can not see what i do deliver out to each , yet i can make my audit up , that all from me do back receive the flour of all , and leave me but the bran . '
what say you ?
it was an answer how apply you this ?
the senators of rome are this good belly , and you the mutinous members , for examine their counsels and their cares , digest things rightly touching the weal o ' the common , you shall find no public benefit which you receive but it proceeds or comes from them to you and no way from yourselves .
what do you think , you , the great toe of this assembly ?
i the great toe !
why the great toe ?
for that , being one o ' the lowest , basest , poorest , of this most wise rebellion , thou foremost thou rascal , that art worst in blood to run , first to win some vantage .
but make you ready your stiff bats and clubs rome and her rats are at the point of battle , the one side must have bale .
enter caius marcius hail , noble marcius !
thanks .
what the matter , you dissentious rogues , that , rubbing the poor itch of your opinion , make yourselves scabs ?
we have ever your good word .
he that will give good words to thee will flatter beneath abhorring .
what would you have , you curs , that like nor peace nor war ?
the one affrights you , the other makes you proud .
he that trusts to you , where he should find you lions , finds you hares , where foxes , geese you are no surer , no , than is the coal of fire upon the ice , or hailstone in the sun .
your virtue is to make him worthy whose offence subdues him and curse that justice did it .
who deserves greatness deserves your hate , and your affections are a sick man appetite , who desires most that which would increase his evil .
he that depends upon your favours swims with fins of lead and hews down oaks with rushes .
hang ye !
trust ye ?
with every minute you do change a mind , and call him noble that was now your hate , him vile that was your garland .
what the matter , that in these several places of the city you cry against the noble senate , who , under the gods , keep you in awe , which else would feed on one another ?
what their seeking ?
for corn at their own rates , whereof , they say , the city is well stored .
hang !
they say !
they sit by the fire , and presume to know what done i ' the capitol , who like to rise , who thrives and who declines , side factions and give out conjectural marriages , making parties strong and feebling such as stand not in their liking below their cobbled shoes .
they say there grain enough !
would the nobility lay aside their ruth , and let me use my sword , i make a quarry with thousands of these quarter slaves , as high as i could pick my lance .
nay , these are almost thoroughly persuaded , for though abundantly they lack discretion , yet are they passing cowardly .
but , i beseech you , what says the other troop ?
they are dissolved hang !
they said they were , sigh forth proverbs , that hunger broke stone walls , that dogs must eat , that meat was made for mouths , that the gods sent not corn for the rich men only with these shreds they vented their complainings , which being answer , and a petition granted them , a strange one to break the heart of generosity , and make bold power look pale they threw their caps as they would hang them on the horns o ' the moon , shouting their emulation .
what is granted them ?
five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms , of their own choice one junius brutus , sicinius velutus , and i know not !
the rabble should have first unroof the city , ere so prevail with me it will in time win upon power and throw forth greater themes for insurrection arguing .
this is strange .
go , get you home , you fragments !
enter a messenger , hastily where caius marcius ?
here what the matter ?
the news is , sir , the volsces are in arms .
i am glad on then we shall ha ' means to vent our musty superfluity .
see , our best elders .
enter cominius , titus lartius , and other senators , junius brutus and sicinius velutus marcius , is true that you have lately told us , the volsces are in arms .
they have a leader , tullus aufidius , that will put you to .
i sin in envying his nobility , and were i any thing but what i am , i would wish me only he .
you have fought together .
were half to half the world by the ears and he .
upon my party , revolt to make only my wars with him he is a lion that i am proud to hunt .
then , worthy marcius , attend upon cominius to these wars .
it is your former promise .
sir , it is , and i am constant .
titus lartius , thou shalt see me once more strike at tullus ' face .
what , art thou stiff ?
out ?
no , caius marcius , i lean upon one crutch and fight with , ere stay behind this business .
o , !
your company to the capitol , where , i know , our greatest friends attend us .
to cominius lead you on .
to marcius right worthy you priority .
noble marcius !
to the citizens hence to your homes , be gone !
nay , let them follow the volsces have much corn , take these rats thither to gnaw their garners .
worshipful mutiners , your valour puts well forth pray , follow .
citizens steal away .
exeunt all but sicinius and brutus was ever man so proud as is this marcius ?
he has no equal .
when we were chosen tribunes for the people , mark you his lip and eyes ?
nay .
but his taunts .
being moved , he will not spare to gird the gods .
the modest moon .
the present wars devour him he is grown too proud to be so valiant .
such a nature , tickled with good success , disdains the shadow which he treads on at noon but i do wonder his insolence can brook to be commanded under cominius .
fame , at the which he aims , in whom already he well graced , can not better be held nor more attain than by a place below the first for what miscarries shall be the general fault , though he perform to the utmost of a man , and giddy censure will then cry out of marcius ' o if he had borne the business ! '
besides , if things go well , opinion that so sticks on marcius shall of his demerits rob cominius .
come half all cominius ' honours are to marcius .
though marcius earned them not , and all his faults to marcius shall be honours , though indeed in aught he merit not .
let hence , and hear how the dispatch is made , and in what fashion , more than his singularity , he goes upon this present action .
lets along .

enter tullus aufidius and certain senators so , your opinion is , aufidius , that they of rome are entered in our counsels and know how we proceed .
is it not yours ?
what ever have been thought on in this state , that could be brought to bodily act ere rome had circumvention ?
is not four days gone since i heard thence , these are the words i think i have the letter here , yes , here it is .
reads have press a power , but it is not known whether for east or west the dearth is great , the people mutinous , and it is rumour , cominius , marcius your old enemy , who is of rome worse hated than of you , and titus lartius , a most valiant roman , these three lead on this preparation whither is bent most likely is for you consider of it . '
our army in the field we never yet made doubt but rome was ready to answer us .
nor did you think it folly to keep your great pretences veil till when they needs must show themselves , which in the hatching , it seem , appear to rome .
by the discovery .
we shall be shorten in our aim , which was to take in many towns ere almost rome should know we were afoot .
noble aufidius , take your commission , hie you to your bands let us alone to guard corioli if they set down before , for the remove bring your army , but , i think , you find they not prepared for us .
o , doubt not that , i speak from certainties .
nay , more , some parcels of their power are forth already , and only hitherward .
i leave your honours .
if we and caius marcius chance to meet , is sworn between us we shall ever strike till one can do no more .
the gods assist you !
and keep your honours safe !

enter volumnia and virgilia they set them down on two low stools , and sew i pray you , daughter , sing , or express yourself in a more comfortable sort if my son were my husband , i should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he won honour than in the embracements of his bed where he would show most love .
when yet he was but and the only son of my womb , when youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way , when for a day of kings ' entreaties a mother should not sell him an hour from her beholding , i , considering how honour would become such a person .
that it was no better than to hang by the wall , if renown made it not stir , was pleased to let him seek danger where he was like to find fame .
to a cruel war i sent him , from whence he returned , his brows bound with oak .
i tell thee , daughter , i sprang not more in joy at first hearing he was a than now in first seeing he had proved himself a man .
but had he died in the business , madam , how then ?
then his good report should have been my son , i therein would have found issue .
hear me profess sincerely had i a dozen sons , each in my love alike and none less dear than thine and my good marcius , i had rather had eleven die nobly for their country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action .
enter a gentlewoman madam , the lady valeria is come to visit you .
beseech you , give me leave to retire myself .
indeed , you shall not .
methinks i hear hither your husband drum , see him pluck aufidius down by the hair , as children from a bear , the volsces shunning him methinks i see him stamp thus , and call thus on , you cowards !
you were got in fear , though you were born in rome ' his bloody brow with his mail hand then wiping , forth he goes , like to a that task to mow or all or lose his hire .
his bloody brow !
o jupiter , no blood !
away , you fool !
it more becomes a man than gilt his trophy the breasts of hecuba , when she did suckle hector , look not lovelier than hector forehead when it spit forth blood at grecian sword , contemning .
tell valeria , we are fit to bid her welcome .
exit gentlewoman heavens bless my lord from fell aufidius !
he beat aufidius below his knee and tread upon his neck .
enter valeria , with an usher and gentlewoman my ladies both , good day to you .
sweet madam .
i am glad to see your ladyship .
how do you both ?
you are manifest .
what are you sewing here ?
a fine spot , in good faith .
how does your little son ?
i thank your ladyship , well , good madam .
he had rather see the swords , and hear a drum , than look upon his .
o ' my word , the father son i swear , is a very pretty boy .
o ' my troth , i looked upon him o ' wednesday half an hour together has such a confirmed countenance .
i saw him run after a gilded butterfly and when he caught it , he let it go again , and after it again , and over and over he comes , and again , catched it again , or whether his fall enraged him , or how was , he did so set his teeth and tear it , o , i warrant it , how he mammocked it !
one on father moods .
indeed , la , is a noble child .
a crack , madam .
come , lay aside your stitchery , i must have you play the idle husewife with me this afternoon .
no , good madam , i will not out of doors .
not out of doors !
she shall , she shall .
indeed , no , by your patience , i not over the threshold till my lord return from the wars .
fie , you confine yourself most unreasonably come , you must go visit the good lady that lies in .
i will wish her speedy strength , and visit her with my prayers , but i can not go thither .
why , i pray you ?
is not to save labour , nor that i want love .
you would be another penelope yet , they say , all the yarn she spun in ulysses ' absence did but fill ithaca full of moths .
come , i would your cambric were sensible as your finger , that you might leave pricking it for pity .
come , you shall go with us .
no , good madam , pardon me , indeed , i will not forth .
in truth , la , go with me , and i tell you excellent news of your husband .
o , good madam , there can be none yet .
verily , i do not jest with you , there came news from him last night .
indeed , madam ?
in earnest , it true , i heard a senator speak it .
thus it is the volsces have an army forth , against whom cominius the general is gone , with one part of our roman power your lord and titus lartius are set down before their city corioli , they nothing doubt prevailing and to make it brief wars .
this is true , on mine honour , and so , i pray , go with us .
give me excuse , good madam , i will obey you in every thing hereafter .
let her alone , lady as she is now , she will but disease our better mirth .
in troth , i think she would .
fare you well , then .
come , good sweet lady .
prithee , virgilia , turn thy solemness out o ' door .
and go along with us .
no , at a word , madam , indeed , i must not .

no , nor a man that fears you less than he , that lesser than a little .

slain , sir , doubtless .
following the fliers at the very heels , with them he enters , who , upon the sudden , clapp to their gates he is himself alone , to answer all the city .
o noble fellow !
who sensibly outdares his senseless sword , and , when it bows , stands up .
thou art left , marcius a carbuncle entire , as big as thou art , were not so rich a jewel .
thou wast a soldier even to cato wish , not fierce and terrible only in strokes , but , with thy grim looks and the percussion of thy sounds , thou madst thine enemies shake , as if the world were feverous and did tremble .
marcius , bleeding , assaulted by the enemy look , sir .
o , is marcius !
let fetch him off , or make remain alike .
they fight , and all enter the city scene corioli .

alarum continues still afar off enter marcius and titus lartius with a trumpet see here these movers that do prize their hours at a crack drachm !
cushions , leaden spoons , irons of a doit , doublets that hangmen would bury with those that wore them , these base slaves , ere yet the fight be done , pack up down with them !
and hark , what noise the general makes !
to him !
there is the man of my soul hate , aufidius , piercing our romans then , valiant titus , take convenient numbers to make good the city , whilst i , with those that have the spirit , will haste to help cominius .
worthy sir , thou , thy exercise hath been too violent for a second course of fight .
sir , praise me not , my work hath yet not warm me fare you well the blood i drop is rather physical than dangerous to me to aufidius thus i will appear , and fight .
now the fair goddess , fortune , fall deep in love with thee , and her great charms misguide thy opposers ' swords !
bold gentleman , prosperity be thy page !
thy friend no less than those she placeth highest !

exeunt scene vi .
near the camp of cominius .
enter cominius , as it were in retire , with soldiers breathe you , my friends well fought , we are come off like romans , neither foolish in our stands , nor cowardly in retire believe me , sirs , we shall be charged again .
whiles we have struck , by interims and conveying gusts we have heard the charges of our friends .
ye roman gods !
lead their successes as we wish our own , that both our powers , with smiling fronts encountering , may give you thankful sacrifice .
enter a messenger thy news ?
the citizens of corioli have issued , and given to lartius and to marcius battle i saw our party to their trenches driven , and then i came away .
though thou truth , methinks thou not well .
how long since ?
above an hour , my lord .
is not a mile , briefly we heard their drums how couldst thou in a mile confound an hour , and bring thy news so late ?
spies of the volsces held me in chase , that i was forced to wheel three or four miles about , else had i , sir , half an hour since brought my report .
who yonder , that does appear as he were flay ?
o gods he has the stamp of marcius , and i have seen him thus .
within come i too late ?
the shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour more than i know the sound of marcius ' tongue from every meaner man .
enter marcius come i too late ?
ay , if you come not in the blood of others , but mantled in your own .
o , let me clip ye in arms as sound as when i woo , in heart as merry as when our nuptial day was done , and tapers burn to bedward !
flower of warriors , how is it with titus lartius ?
as with a man busied about decrees condemning some to death , and some to exile , ransoming him , or pitying , threatening the other , holding corioli in the name of rome , even like a fawning greyhound in the leash , to let him slip at will .
where is that slave which told me they had beat you to your trenches ?
where is he ?
call him hither .
let him alone , he did inform the truth but for our gentlemen , the common file a plague !
tribunes for them ! the mouse shunn the cat as they did budge from rascals worse than they .
but how prevail you ?
will the time serve to tell ?
i do not think .
where is the enemy ?
are you lords o ' the field ?
if not , why cease you till you are so ?
marcius , we have at disadvantage fought and did retire to win our purpose .
how lies their battle ?
know you on which side they have placed their men of trust ?
as i guess , marcius , their bands i ' the vaward are the antiates , of their best trust , them aufidius , their very heart of hope .
i do beseech you , by all the battles wherein we have fought , by the blood we have shed together , by the vows we have made to endure friends , that you directly set me against aufidius and his antiates , and that you not delay the present , but , filling the air with swords advanced and darts , we prove this very hour .
though i could wish you were conducted to a gentle bath and balms applied to , you , yet dare i never deny your asking take your choice of those that best can aid your action .
those are they that most are willing .
if any such be here as it were sin to doubt that love this painting wherein you see me smear , if any fear lesser his person than an ill report , if any think brave death outweighs bad life and that his country dearer than himself , let him alone , or so many so minded , wave thus , to express his disposition , and follow marcius .
they all shout and wave their swords , take him up in their arms , and cast up their caps o , me alone !
make you a sword of me ?
if these shows be not outward , which of you but is four volsces ?
none of you but is able to bear against the great aufidius a shield as hard as his .
a certain number , though thanks to all , must i select from all the rest shall bear the business in some other fight , as cause will be obey .
please you to march , and four shall quickly draw out my command , which men are best inclined .
march on , my fellows make good this ostentation , and you shall divide in all with us .
exeunt scene vii .
the gates of corioli .
titus lartius , having set a guard upon corioli , going with drum and trumpet toward cominius and caius marcius , enters with lieutenant , other soldiers , and a scout so , let the ports be guarded keep your duties , as i have set them down .
if i do send , dispatch those centuries to our aid the rest will serve for a short holding if we lose the field , we can not keep the town .
fear not our care , sir .

fix thy foot .
let the first budger die the other slave , and the gods doom him after !
if i fly , marcius , holloa me like a hare .
within these three hours , tullus , alone i fought in your corioli walls , and made what work i pleased is not my blood wherein thou seest me mask , for thy revenge wrench up thy power to the highest .
wert thou the hector that was the whip of your bragg progeny , thou shouldst not scape me here .

enter , from one side , cominius with the romans , from the other side , marcius , with his arm in a scarf if i should tell thee this thy day work , not believe thy deeds but i report it where senators shall mingle tears with smiles , where great patricians shall attend and shrug , i ' the end admire , where ladies shall be frighted , and , gladly quaked , hear more , where the dull tribunes , that , with the fusty plebeians , hate thine honours , shall say against their hearts thank the gods our rome hath such a soldier .

yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast , having fully dined before .
enter titus lartius , with his power , from the pursuit o general , here is the steed , we the caparison hadst thou beheld pray now , no more my mother , who has a charter to extol her blood , when she does praise me grieves me .
i have done as you have done , that what i can , induced as you have been , that for my country he that has but effected his good will hath mine act .
you shall not be the grave of your deserving , rome must know the value of her own a concealment worse than a theft , no less than a traducement , to hide your doings , and to silence that , which , to the spire and top of praises vouch , would seem but modest therefore , i beseech you in sign of what you are , not to reward what you have done before our army hear me .
i have some wounds upon me , and they smart to hear themselves remember .
should they not , well might they fester ingratitude , and tent themselves with death .
of all the horses , whereof we have good and good store , of all the treasure in this field achieved and city , we render you the tenth , to be forth , before the common distribution , at your only choice .
i thank you , general , but can not make my heart consent to take a bribe to pay my sword i do refuse it , and stand upon my common part with those that have beheld the doing .
a long flourish .
they all cry !
marcius ! '
cast up their caps and lances cominius and lartius stand bare may these same instruments , which you profane , never sound more !
when drums and trumpets shall i ' the field prove flatterers , let courts and cities be made all of soothing !
when steel grows soft as the parasite silk , let him be made a coverture for the wars !
no more , i say !
for that i have not wash my nose that bled , or foil some debile which , without note , here many else have done , you shout me forth in acclamations hyperbolical , as if i loved my little should be dieted in praises sauced with lies .
too modest are you , more cruel to your good report than grateful to us that give you truly by your patience , if yourself you be incensed , we put you , like one that means his proper harm , in manacles , then reason safely with you .
therefore , be it known , as to us , to all the world , that caius marcius wears this war garland in token of the which , my noble steed , known to the camp , i give him , with all his trim belonging , and from this time , for what he did before corioli , call him , with all the applause and clamour of the host , caius marcius coriolanus !
bear the addition nobly ever !
flourish .
trumpets sound , and drums caius marcius coriolanus !
i will go wash , and when my face is fair , you shall perceive whether i blush or no howbeit , i thank you .
i mean to stride your steed , and at all times to undercrest your good addition to the fairness of my power .
so , to our tent , where , ere we do repose us , we will write to rome of our success .
you , titus lartius , must to corioli back send us to rome the best , with whom we may articulate , for their own good and ours .
i shall , my lord .
the gods begin to mock me .
i , that now refused most princely gifts , am bound to beg of my lord general .
, is yours .
what ?
i sometime lay here in corioli at a poor man house , he used me kindly he cried to me , i saw him prisoner , but then aufidius was with in my view , and wrath my pity i request you to give my poor host freedom .
o , well begg !
were he the butcher of my son , he should be free as is the wind .
deliver him , titus .
marcius , his name ?
by jupiter !
forgot .
i am weary , yea , my memory is tired .
have we no wine here ?

condition !
i would i were a roman , for i can not , being a volsce , be that i am .
condition !
what good condition can a treaty find i ' the part that is at mercy ?
five times , marcius , i have fought with thee so often hast thou beat me , and wouldst do so , i think , should we encounter as often as we eat .
by the elements , if again i meet him beard to beard , he mine , or i am his mine emulation hath not that honour i it had , for where i thought to crush him in an equal force , true sword to sword , i potch at him some way or wrath or craft may get him .
he the devil .
bolder , though not so subtle .
my valour poison with only suffering stain by him , for him shall fly out of itself nor sleep nor sanctuary , being naked , sick , nor fane nor capitol , the prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice , embarquements all of fury , shall lift up their rotten privilege and custom my hate to marcius where i find him , were it at home , upon my brother guard , even there , against the hospitable canon , would i wash my fierce hand in heart .
go you to the city , learn how is held , and what they are that must be hostages for rome .
will not you go ?
i am attended at the cypress grove i pray you is south the city mills bring me word thither how the world goes , that to the pace of it i may spur on my journey .

not according to the prayer of the people , for they love not marcius .
nature teaches beasts to know their friends .
pray you , who does the wolf love ?
the lamb .
ay , to devour him , as the hungry plebeians would the noble marcius .
he a lamb indeed , that baes like a bear .
he a bear indeed , that lives like a lamb .
you two are old men tell me one thing that i shall ask you .
well , sir .
in what enormity is marcius poor in , that you two have not in abundance ?
he poor in no one fault , but stored with all .
especially in pride .
and topping all others in boasting .
this is strange now do you two know how you are censured here in the city , i mean of us o ' the file ?
do you ?
why , how are we censured ?
because you talk of pride now , will you not be angry ?
well , well , sir , well .
why , is no great matter , for a very little thief of occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience give your dispositions the reins , and be angry at your pleasures , at the least if you take it as a pleasure to you in being so .
you blame marcius for being proud ?
we do it not alone , sir .
i know you can do very little alone , for your helps are many , or else your actions would grow wondrous single your abilities are too for doing much alone .
you talk of pride o that you could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks , and make but an interior survey of your good selves !
o that you could !
what then , sir ?
why , then you should discover a brace of unmeriting , proud , violent , testy magistrates , alias fools , as any in rome .
menenius , you are known well enough too .
i am known to be a humorous patrician , and one that loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying tiber i , said to be something imperfect in favouring the first complaint , hasty and upon too trivial motion , one that converses more with the buttock of the night than with the forehead of the morning what i think i utter , and spend my malice in my breath .
meeting two such wealsmen as you are i can not call you lycurguses if the drink you give me touch my palate adversely , i make a crooked face at it .
i ca say your worships have delivered the matter well , when i find the ass in compound with the major part of your syllables and though i must be content to bear with those that say you are reverend grave men , yet they lie deadly that tell you you have good faces .
if you see this in the map of my microcosm , follows it that i am known well enough too ?
what barm can your bisson conspectuities glean out of this character , if i be known well enough too ?
come , sir , come , we know you well enough .
you know neither me , yourselves nor any thing .
you are ambitious for poor knaves ' caps and legs you wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a cause between an orange wife and a , and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a second day of audience .
when you are hearing a matter between party and party , if you chance to be pinched with the colic , you make faces like mummers , set up the bloody flag against all patience , and , in roaring for a , dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled by your hearing all the peace you make in their cause is , calling both the parties knaves .
you are a pair of strange ones .
come , come , you are well understood to be a perfecter giber for the table than a necessary bencher in the capitol .
our very priests must become mockers , if they shall encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are .
when you speak best unto the purpose , it is not worth the wagging of your beards , and your beards deserve not so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher cushion , or to be entombed in an ass saddle .
yet you must be saying , marcius is proud , who in a cheap estimation , is worth predecessors since deucalion , though peradventure some of the best of were hereditary hangmen .
to your worships more of your conversation would infect my brain , being the herdsmen of the beastly plebeians i will be bold to take my leave of you .
brutus and sicinius go aside enter volumnia , virgilia , and valeria how now , my as fair as noble ladies , and the moon , were she earthly , no nobler , whither do you follow your eyes so fast ?
honourable menenius , my boy marcius approaches , for the love of juno , let go .
ha !
marcius coming home !
ay , worthy menenius , and with most prosperous approbation .
take my cap , jupiter , and i thank thee .
hoo !
marcius coming home !
nay , is true .
look , here a letter from him the state hath another , his wife another , and , i think , there one at home for you .
i will make my very house reel tonight a letter for me !
yes , certain , there a letter for you , i .
a letter for me !
it gives me an estate of seven years ' health , in which time i will make a lip at the physician the most sovereign prescription in galen is but empiricutic , and , to this preservative , of no better report than a .
is he not wounded ?
he was wont to come home wounded .
o , no , no , no .
o , he is wounded , i thank the gods .
so do i too , if it be not too much brings a ' victory in his pocket ?
the wounds become him .
on brows menenius , he comes the third time home with the oaken garland .
has he disciplined aufidius soundly ?
titus lartius writes , they fought together , but aufidius got off .
and was time for him too , i warrant him that an he had stayed by him , i would not have been so fidiused for all the chests in corioli , and the gold that in them .
is the senate possessed of this ?
good ladies , let go .
yes , yes , yes , the senate has letters from the general , wherein he gives my son the whole name of the war he hath in this action outdone his former deeds doubly in troth , there wondrous things spoke of him .
wondrous !
ay , i warrant you , and not without his true purchasing .
the gods grant them true !
true !
pow , wow .
true !
i be sworn they are true .
where is he wounded ?
to the tribunes god save your good worships !
marcius is coming home he has more cause to be proud .
where is he wounded ?
i ' the shoulder and i ' the left arm there will be large cicatrices to show the people , when he shall stand for his place .
he received in the repulse of tarquin seven hurts i ' the body .
one i ' the neck , and two i ' the thigh , there nine that i know .
he had , before this last expedition , wounds upon him .
now it every gash was an enemy grave .
a shout and flourish hark !
the trumpets .
these are the ushers of marcius before him he carries noise , and behind him he leaves tears death , that dark spirit , in nervy arm doth lie , which , being advanced , declines , and then men die .
a sennet .
trumpets sound .
enter cominius the general , and titus lartius , between them , coriolanus , crowned with an oaken garland , with captains and soldiers , and a herald know , rome , that all alone marcius did fight within corioli gates where he hath won , with fame , a name to caius marcius , these in honour follows coriolanus .
welcome to rome , renowned coriolanus !
flourish welcome to rome , renowned coriolanus !
no more of this , it does offend my heart pray now , no more .
look , sir , your mother !
o , you have , i know , petition all the gods for my prosperity !
kneels nay , my good soldier , up , my gentle marcius , worthy caius , and by honour newly named , what is it ? coriolanus must i call thee ? but o , thy wife !
my gracious silence , hail !
wouldst thou have laugh had i come coffin home , that to see me triumph ?
ay , my dear , such eyes the widows in corioli wear , and mothers that lack sons .
now , the gods crown thee !
and live you yet ?
to valeria o my sweet lady , pardon .
i know not where to turn o , welcome home and welcome , general and ye welcome all .
a hundred thousand welcomes .
i could weep and i could laugh , i am light and heavy .
welcome .
a curse begin at very root on heart , that is not glad to see thee !
you are three that rome should dote on yet , by the faith of men , we have some old here at home that will not be grafted to your relish .
yet welcome , warriors we call a nettle but a nettle and the faults of fools but folly .
ever right .
menenius ever , ever .
give way there , and go on !
to volumnia and virgilia your hand , and yours ere in our own house i do shade my head , the good patricians must be visited , from whom i have received not only greetings , but with them change of honours .
i have lived to see inherited my very wishes and the buildings of my fancy only there one thing wanting , which i doubt not but our rome will cast upon thee .
know , good mother , i had rather be their servant in my way , than sway with them in theirs .
on , to the capitol !
flourish .
cornets .
exeunt in state , as before .
brutus and sicinius come forward all tongues speak of him , and the bleared sights are spectacled to see him your prattling nurse into a rapture lets her baby cry while she chats him the kitchen malkin pins her richest lockram her reechy neck , clambering the walls to eye him stalls , bulks , windows , are smother up , leads fill , and ridges horsed with variable complexions , all agreeing in earnestness to see him flamens do press among the popular throngs and puff to win a vulgar station or veil dames commit the war of white and damask in their cheeks to the wanton spoil of phoebus ' burning kisses such a pother as if that whatsoever god who leads him were slily crept into his human powers and gave him graceful posture .
on the sudden , i warrant him consul .
then our office may , during his power , go sleep .
he can not temperately transport his honours from where he should begin and end , but will lose those he hath won .
in that there comfort .
doubt not the commoners , for whom we stand , but they upon their ancient malice will forget with the least cause these his new honours , which that he will give them make i as little question as he is proud to .
i heard him swear , were he to stand for consul , never would he appear i ' the nor on him put the napless vesture of humility , nor showing , as the manner is , his wounds to the people , beg their stinking breaths .
is right .
it was his word o , he would miss it rather than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him , and the desire of the nobles .
i wish no better than have him hold that purpose and to put it in execution .
is most like he will .
it shall be to him then as our good wills , a sure destruction .
so it must fall out to him or our authorities .
for an end , we must suggest the people in what hatred he still hath held them , that to power he would have made them mules , silenced their pleaders and dispropertied their freedoms , holding them , in human action and capacity , of no more soul nor fitness for the world than camels in the war , who have their provand only for bearing burdens , and sore blows for sinking under them .
this , as you say , suggested at some time when his soaring insolence shall touch the people which time shall not want , if he be put upon , and that as easy as to set dogs on sheep will be his fire to kindle their dry stubble , and their blaze shall darken him for ever .
enter a messenger what the matter ?
you are sent for to the capitol .
is thought that marcius shall be consul i have seen the dumb men throng to see him and the blind to bear him speak matrons flung gloves , ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers , upon him as he pass the nobles bended , as to jove statue , and the commons made a shower and thunder with their caps and shouts i never saw the like .
let to the capitol , and carry with us ears and eyes for the time , but hearts for the event .
have with you .
exeunt scene ii .
the same .
the capitol .
enter two officers , to lay cushions come , come , they are almost here .
how many stand for consulships ?
three , they say but is thought of every one coriolanus will carry it .
that a brave fellow , but he vengeance proud , and loves not the common people .
faith , there had been many great men that have flattered the people , who loved them , and there be many that they have loved , they know not wherefore so that , if they love they know not why , they hate upon no better a ground therefore , for coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate him manifests the true knowledge he has in their disposition , and out of his noble carelessness lets them plainly .
if he did not care whether he had their love or no , he waved indifferently doing them neither good nor harm but he seeks their hate with greater devotion than can render it him , and leaves nothing undone that may fully discover him their opposite .
now , to seem to affect the malice and displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he dislikes , to flatter them for their love .
he hath deserved worthily of his country and his ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who , having been supple and courteous to the people , bonneted , without any further deed to have them at an into their estimation and report but he hath so planted his honours in their eyes , and his actions in their hearts , that for their tongues to be silent , and not confess so much , were a kind of ingrateful injury , to report otherwise , were a malice , that , giving itself the lie , would pluck reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it .
no more of him , he is a worthy man make way , they are coming .
a sennet .
enter , with actors before them , cominius the consul , menenius , coriolanus , senators , sicinius and brutus .
the senators take their places , the tribunes take their places by themselves .
coriolanus stands having determined of the volsces and to send for titus lartius , it remains , as the main point of this our , to gratify his noble service that hath thus stood for his country therefore , please you , most reverend and grave elders , to desire the present consul , and last general in our successes , to report a little of that worthy work perform by caius marcius coriolanus , whom we met here both to thank and to remember with honours like himself .
speak , good cominius leave nothing out for length , and make us think rather our state defective for requital than we to stretch it out .
to the tribunes masters o ' the people , we do request your kindest ears , and after , your loving motion toward the common body , to yield what passes here .
we are convented upon a pleasing treaty , and have hearts inclinable to honour and advance the theme of our assembly .
which the rather we shall be blest to do , if he remember a kinder value of the people than he hath hereto prized them at .
that off , that off , i would you rather had been silent .
please you to hear cominius speak ?
most willingly , but yet my caution was more pertinent than the rebuke you give it .
he loves your people but tie him not to be their bedfellow .
worthy cominius , speak .
coriolanus offers to go away nay , keep your place .
sit , coriolanus , never shame to hear what you have nobly done .
your horror pardon i had rather have my wounds to heal again than hear say how i got them .
sir , i hope my words disbench you not .
no , sir yet oft , when blows have made me stay , i fled from words .
you soothed not , therefore hurt not but your people , i love them as they weigh .
pray now , sit down .
i had rather have one scratch my head i ' the sun when the alarum were struck than idly sit to hear my nothings monster .
exit masters of the people , your multiplying spawn how can he flatter that thousand to one good one when you now see he had rather venture all his limbs for honour than one on ears to hear it ?
proceed , cominius .
i shall lack voice the deeds of coriolanus should not be utter feebly .
it is held that valour is the chiefest virtue , and most dignifies the haver if it be , the man i speak of can not in the world be singly counterpoised .
at sixteen years , when tarquin made a head for rome , he fought beyond the mark of others our then dictator , whom with all praise i point at , saw him fight , when with his amazonian chin he drove the bristled lips before him be bestrid an roman and i ' the consul view slew three opposers tarquin self he met , and struck him on his knee in that day feats , when he might act the woman in the scene , he proved best man i ' the field , and for his meed was with the oak .
his pupil age thus , he waxed like a sea , and in the brunt of seventeen battles since he lurch all swords of the garland .
for this last , before and in corioli , let me say , i can not speak him home he stopp the fliers , and by his rare example made the coward turn terror into sport as weeds before a vessel under sail , so men obey and fell below his stem his sword , death stamp , where it did mark , it took , from face to foot he was a thing of blood , whose every motion was timed with dying cries alone he enter the mortal gate of the city , which he painted with shunless destiny , aidless came off , and with a sudden reinforcement struck corioli like a planet now all his when , by and by , the din of war gan pierce his ready sense , then straight his doubled spirit what in flesh was fatigate , and to the battle came he , where he did run reeking the lives of men , as if a perpetual spoil and till we call both field and city ours , he never stood to ease his breast with panting .
worthy man !
he can not but with measure fit the honours which we devise him .
our spoils he kick at , and look upon things precious as they were the common muck of the world he covets less than misery itself would give , rewards his deeds with doing them , and is content to spend the time to end it .
he right noble let him be call for .
call coriolanus .
he doth appear .
coriolanus the senate , coriolanus , are well pleased to make thee consul .
i do owe them still my life and services .
it then remains that you do speak to the people .
i do beseech you , let me that custom , for i can not put on the gown , stand naked and entreat them , for my wounds ' sake , to give their suffrage please you that i may pass this doing .
sir , the people must have their voices , neither will they bate one jot of ceremony .
put them not pray you , go fit you to the custom and take to you , as your predecessors have , your honour with your form .
it is apart that i shall blush in acting , and might well be taken from the people .
mark you that ?
to brag unto them , thus i did , and thus , show them the unaching scars which i should hide , as if i had received them for the hire of their breath only !
do not stand upo .
we recommend to you , tribunes of the people , our purpose to them and to our noble consul wish we all joy and honour .
to coriolanus come all joy and honour !
flourish of cornets .
exeunt all but sicinius and brutus you see how he intends to use the people .
may they perceive intent !
he will require them , as if he did contemn what he requested should be in them to give .
come , we inform them of our proceedings here on the marketplace , i know , they do attend us .
exeunt scene iii .
the same .
the forum .
enter seven or eight citizens once , if he do require our voices , we ought not to deny him .
we may , sir , if we will .
we have power in ourselves to do it , but it is a power that we have no power to do , for if he show us his wounds and tell us his deeds , we are to put our tongues into those wounds and speak for them , so , if he tell us his noble deeds , we must also tell him our noble acceptance of them .
ingratitude is monstrous , and for the multitude to be ingrateful , were to make a monster of the multitude of the which we being members , should bring ourselves to be monstrous members .
and to make us no better thought of , a little help will serve , for once we stood up about the corn , he himself stuck not to call us the multitude .
we have been called so of many , not that our heads are some brown , some black , some auburn , some bald , but that our wits are so diversely coloured and truly i think if all our wits were to issue out of one skull , they would fly east , west , north , south , and their consent of one direct way should be at once to all the points o ' the compass .
think you so ?
which way do you judge my wit would fly ?
nay , your wit will not so soon out as another man will , is strongly wedged up in a , but if it were at liberty , , sure , southward .
why that way ?
to lose itself in a fog , where being three parts melted away with rotten dews , the fourth would return for conscience sake , to help to get thee a wife .
you are never without your tricks you may , you may .
are you all resolved to give your voices ?
but that no matter , the greater part carries it .
i say , if he would incline to the people , there was never a worthier man .
enter coriolanus in a gown of humility , with menenius here he comes , and in the gown of humility mark his behavior .
we are not to stay all together , but to come by him where he stands , by ones , by twos , and by threes .
he to make his requests by particulars , wherein every one of us has a single honour , in giving him our own voices with our own tongues therefore follow me , and i direct you how you shall go by him .
content , content .
exeunt citizens o sir , you are not right have you not known the worthiest men have ?
what must i say ?
' i pray , sir ' plague upo !
i can not bring my tongue to such a pace , sir , my wounds !
i got them in my country service , when some certain of your brethren roar and ran from the noise of our own drums . '
o me , the gods !
you must not speak of that you must desire them to think upon you .
think upon me !
hang !
i would they would forget me , like the virtues which our divines lose by .
you mar all i leave you pray you , speak to , i pray you , in wholesome manner .
exit bid them wash their faces and keep their teeth clean .
two of the citizens so , here comes a brace .
a third citizen you know the cause , air , of my standing here .
we do , sir , tell us what hath brought you .
mine own desert .
your own desert !
ay , but not mine own desire .
how not your own desire ?
no , sir , was never my desire yet to trouble the poor with begging .
you must think , if we give you any thing , we hope to gain by you .
well then , i pray , your price o ' the consulship ?
the price is to ask it kindly .
kindly !
sir , i pray , let me i have wounds to show you , which shall be yours in private .
your good voice , sir , what say you ?
you shall ha ' it , worthy sir .
a match , sir .
there in all two worthy voices begged .
i have your alms adieu .
but this is something odd .
an to give again , but is no matter .
exeunt the three citizens two other citizens pray you now , if it may stand with the tune of your voices that i may be consul , i have here the customary gown .
you have deserved nobly of your country , and you have not deserved nobly .
your enigma ?
you have been a scourge to her enemies , you have been a rod to her friends , you have not indeed loved the common people .
you should account me the more virtuous that i have not been common in my love .
i will , sir , flatter my sworn brother , the people , to earn a dearer estimation of them , is a condition they account gentle and since the wisdom of their choice is rather to have my hat than my heart , i will practise the insinuating nod and be off to them most counterfeitly , that is , sir , i will counterfeit the bewitchment of some popular man and give it bountiful to the desirers .
therefore , beseech you , i may be consul .
we hope to find you our friend , and therefore give you our voices heartily .
you have received many wounds for your country .
i will not seal your knowledge with showing them .
i will make much of your voices , and so trouble you no further .
the gods give you joy , sir , heartily !
exeunt most sweet voices !
better it is to die , better to starve , than crave the hire which first we do deserve .
why in this woolvish toge should i stand here , to beg of hob and dick , that do appear , their needless vouches ?
custom calls me what custom wills , in all things should we , the dust on antique time would lie unswept , and mountainous error be too highly heapt for truth to .
rather than fool it so , let the high office and the honour go to one that would do thus .
i am half through , the one part suffer , the other will i do .
three citizens more here come more voices .
your voices for your voices i have fought , watch for your voices , for your voices bear of wounds two dozen odd , battles thrice six i have seen and heard of , for your voices have done many things , some less , some more your voices indeed i would be consul .
he has done nobly , and can not go without any honest man voice .
therefore let him be consul the gods give him joy , and make him good friend to the people !
amen , amen .
god save thee , noble consul !
exeunt worthy voices !
menenius , with brutus and sicinius you have stood your limitation , and the tribunes endue you with the people voice remains that , in the official marks invested , you anon do meet the senate .
is this done ?
the custom of request you have discharged the people do admit you , and are summon to meet anon , upon your approbation .
where ?
at the ?
there , coriolanus .
may i change these garments ?
you may , sir .
that i straight do , and , knowing myself again , repair to the .
i keep you company .
will you along ?
we stay here for the people .
fare you well .
exeunt coriolanus and menenius he has it now , and by his looks methink is warm at heart .
with a proud heart he wore his humble weeds .
will you dismiss the people ?
citizens how now , my masters !
have you chose this man ?
he has our voices , sir .
we pray the gods he may deserve your loves .
amen , sir to my poor unworthy notice , he mock us when he begg our voices .
certainly he flouted us downright .
no , is his kind of speech he did not mock us .
not one amongst us , save yourself , but says he used us scornfully he should have show us his marks of merit , wounds received for country .
why , so he did , i am sure .
no , no , no man saw .
he said he had wounds , which he could show in private , and with his hat , thus waving it in scorn , ' i would be consul , ' says he custom , but by your voices , will not so permit me , your voices therefore . '
when we granted that , here was ' i thank you for your voices thank you your most sweet voices now you have left your voices , i have no further with you . '
was not this mockery ?
why either were you ignorant to , or , seeing it , of such childish friendliness to yield your voices ?
could you not have told him as you were lesson , when he had no power , but was a petty servant to the state , he was your enemy , ever spake against your liberties and the charters that you bear i ' the body of the weal , and now , arriving a place of potency and sway o ' the state , if he should still malignantly remain fast foe to the plebeii , your voices might be curses to yourselves ?
you should have said that as his worthy deeds did claim no less than what he stood for , so his gracious nature would think upon you for your voices and translate his malice towards you into love , standing your friendly lord .
thus to have said , as you were , had touch his spirit and tried his inclination , from him pluck either his gracious promise , which you might , as cause had call you up , have held him to or else it would have gall his surly nature , which easily endures not article tying him to aught , so putting him to rage , you should have the advantage of his choler and pass him unelected .
did you perceive he did solicit you in free contempt when he did need your loves , and do you think that his contempt shall not be bruising to you , when he hath power to crush ?
why , had your bodies no heart among you ?
or had you tongues to cry against the rectorship of judgment ?
have you ere now denied the asker ?
and now again of him that did not ask , but mock , bestow your tongues ?
he not confirm , we may deny him yet .
and will deny him i have five hundred voices of that sound .
i twice five hundred and their friends to piece .
get you hence instantly , and tell those friends , they have chose a consul that will from them take their liberties , make them of no more voice than dogs that are as often beat for barking as therefore kept to do so .
let them assemble , and on a safer judgment all revoke your ignorant election , enforce his pride , and his old hate unto you , besides , forget not with what contempt he wore the humble weed , how in his suit he scorn you , but your loves , thinking upon his services , took from you the apprehension of his present portance , which most gibingly , ungravely , he did fashion after the inveterate hate he bears you .
lay a fault on us , your tribunes , that we laboured , no impediment between , but that you must cast your election on him .
say , you chose him more after our commandment than as guided by your own true affections , and that your minds , preoccupied with what you rather must do than what you should , made you against the grain to voice him consul lay the fault on us .
ay , spare us not .
say we read lectures to you .
how youngly he began to serve his country , how long continued , and what stock he springs of , the noble house o ' the marcians , from whence came that ancus marcius , numa daughter son , who , after great hostilius , here was king , of the same house publius and quintus were , that our beat water brought by conduits hither , and censorinus , nobly named so , twice being by the people chosen censor , was his great ancestor .
one thus descended , that hath beside well in his person wrought to be set high in place , we did commend to your remembrances but you have found , scaling his present bearing with his past , that he your fixed enemy , and revoke your sudden approbation .
say , you had harp on that still but by our putting on , and presently , when you have drawn your number , repair to the capitol .
we will so almost all repent in their election .
exeunt citizens let them go on , this mutiny were better put in hazard , than stay , past doubt , for greater if , as his nature is , he fall in rage with their refusal , both observe and answer the vantage of his anger .
to the capitol , come we will be there before the stream o ' the people , and this shall seem , as partly is , their own , which we have goaded onward .

he had , my lord , and that it was which caused our swifter composition .
so then the volsces stand but as at first , ready , when time shall prompt them , to make road .
upon again .
they are worn , lord consul , so , that we shall hardly in our ages see their banners wave again .
saw you aufidius ?
on he came to me , and did curse against the volsces , for they had so vilely yielded the town he is retired to antium .
spoke he of me ?
he did , my lord .
how ?
what ?
how often he had met you , sword to sword , that of all things upon the earth he hated your person most , that he would pawn his fortunes to hopeless restitution , so he might be call your vanquisher .
at antium lives he ?
at antium .
i wish i had a cause to seek him there , to oppose his hatred fully .
welcome home .
enter sicinius and brutus behold , these are the tribunes of the people , the tongues o ' the common mouth i do despise them , for they do prank them in authority , against all noble sufferance .
pass no further .
ha !
what is that ?
it will be dangerous to go on no further .
what makes this change ?
the matter ?
hath he not pass the noble and the common ?
cominius , no .
have i had children voices ?
tribunes , give way , he shall to the .
the people are incensed against him .
stop , or all will fall in broil .
are these your herd ?
must these have voices , that can yield them now and straight disclaim their tongues ?
what are your offices ?
you being their mouths , why rule you not their teeth ?
have you not set them on ?
be calm , be calm .
it is a purposed thing , and grows by plot , to curb the will of the nobility , and live with such as can not rule nor ever will be ruled .
not a plot the people cry you mock them , and of late , when corn was given them gratis , you repined , scandal the suppliants for the people , call them , flatterers , foes to nobleness .
why , this was known before .
not to them all .
have you inform them sithence ?
how !
i inform them !
you are like to do such business .
not unlike , each way , to better yours .
why then should i be consul ?
by yond clouds , let me deserve so ill as you , and make me your fellow tribune .
you show too much of that for which the people stir if you will pass to where you are bound , you must inquire your way , which you are out of , with a gentler spirit , or never be so noble as a consul , nor yoke with him for tribune .
let be calm .
the people are abused , set on .
this paltering becomes not rome , nor has coriolanus deserved this so dishonour rub , laid falsely i ' the plain way of his merit .
tell me of corn !
this was my speech , and i will again not now , not now .
not in this heat , sir , now .
now , as i live , i will .
my nobler friends , i crave their pardons for the mutable , many , let them regard me as i do not flatter , and therein behold themselves i say again , in soothing them , we nourish our senate the cockle of rebellion , insolence , sedition , which we ourselves have plough for , sow , and scatter , by mingling them with us , the honour number , who lack not virtue , no , nor power , but that which they have given to beggars .
well , no more .
no more words , we beseech you .
how !
no more !
as for my country i have shed my blood , not fearing outward force , so shall my lungs coin words till their decay against those measles , which we disdain should tatter us , yet sought the very way to catch them .
you speak o ' the people , as if you were a god to punish , not a man of their infirmity .
well we let the people .
what , what ?
his choler ?
choler !
were i as patient as the midnight sleep , by jove , be my mind !
it is a mind that shall remain a poison where it is , not poison any further .
shall remain !
hear you this triton of the minnows ?
mark you his absolute ' ?
was from the canon .
' !
o good but most unwise patricians !
why , you grave but reckless senators , have you thus given hydra here to choose an officer , that with his peremptory , ' being but the horn and noise o ' the monster , wants not spirit to say he turn your current in a ditch , and make your channel his ?
if he have power then vail your ignorance , if none , awake your dangerous lenity .
if you are learn , be not as common fools , if you are not , let them have cushions by you .
you are plebeians , if they be senators and they are no less , when , both your voices blended , the taste most palates theirs .
they choose their magistrate , and such a one as he , who puts his , ' his popular ' against a graver bench than ever frown in greece .
by jove himself !
it makes the consuls base and my soul aches to know , when two authorities are up , neither supreme , how soon confusion may enter the gap of both and take the one by the other .
well , on to the .
whoever gave that counsel , to give forth the corn o ' the storehouse gratis , as was used sometime in greece , well , well , no more of that .
though there the people had more absolute power , i say , they nourish disobedience , fed the ruin of the state .
why , shall the people give one that speaks thus their voice ?
i give my reasons , more worthier than their voices .
they know the corn was not our recompense , resting well assured that did service being press to the war , even when the navel of the state was touch , they would not thread the gates .
this kind of service did not deserve corn gratis .
being i ' the war their mutinies and revolts , wherein they show most valour , spoke not for them the accusation which they have often made against the senate , all cause unborn , could never be the motive of our so frank donation .
well , what then ?
how shall this bisson multitude digest the senate courtesy ?
let deeds express what like to be their words did request it , we are the greater poll , and in true fear they gave us our demands . '
thus we debase the nature of our seats and make the rabble call our cares fears , which will in time break ope the locks o ' the senate and bring in the crows to peck the eagles .
come , enough .
enough , with .
no , take more what may be sworn by , both divine and human , seal what i end withal !
this double worship , where one part does disdain with cause , the other insult without all reason , where gentry , title , wisdom , can not conclude but by the yea and no of general ignorance , it must omit real necessities , and give way the while to unstable slightness purpose so barr , it follows , nothing is done to purpose .
therefore , beseech you , you that will be less fearful than discreet , that love the fundamental part of state more than you doubt the change o , that prefer a noble life before a long , and wish to jump a body with a dangerous physic that sure of death without it , at once pluck out the multitudinous tongue , let them not lick the sweet which is their poison your dishonour mangles true judgment and bereaves the state of that integrity which should , not having the power to do the good it would , for the in which doth .
has said enough .
has spoken like a traitor , and shall answer as traitors do .
thou wretch , despite thee !
what should the people do with these bald tribunes ?
on whom depending , their obedience fails to the greater bench in a rebellion , when what not meet , but what must be , was law , then were they chosen in a better hour , let what is meet be said it must be meet , and throw their power i ' the dust .
manifest treason !
this a consul ?
no .
the aediles , ho !
enter an aedile let him be apprehended .
go , call the people exit aedile in whose name myself attach thee as a traitorous innovator , a foe to the public weal obey , i charge thee , and follow to thine answer .
hence , old goat !
senators , and c we surety him .
aged sir , hands off .
hence , rotten thing !
or i shall shake thy bones out of thy garments .
help , ye citizens !
enter a rabble of citizens ( plebeians ) , with the aediles on both sides more respect .
here he that would take from you all your power .
seize him , aediles !
down with him !
down with him !
senators , and c weapons , weapons , weapons !
they all bustle about coriolanus , crying ! '
! '
! '
, ho ! '
! '
! '
! '
! '
, peace , peace ! '
, hold , peace ! '
what is about to be ?
i am out of breath , confusion near , i can not speak .
you , tribunes to the people !
coriolanus , patience !
speak , good sicinius .
hear me , people , peace !
let hear our tribune peace speak , speak , speak .
you are at point to lose your liberties marcius would have all from you , marcius , whom late you have named for consul .
fie , fie , fie !
this is the way to kindle , not to quench .
to unbuild the city and to lay all flat .
what is the city but the people ?
true , the people are the city .
by the consent of all , we were establish the people magistrates .
you so remain .
and so are like to do .
that is the way to lay the city flat , to bring the roof to the foundation , and bury all , which yet distinctly ranges , in heaps and piles of ruin .
this deserves death .
or let us stand to our authority , or let us lose it .
we do here pronounce , upon the part o ' the people , in whose power we were elected theirs , marcius is worthy of present death .
therefore lay hold of him , bear him to the rock tarpeian , and from thence into destruction cast him .
aediles , seize him !
yield , marcius , yield !
hear me one word , beseech you , tribunes , hear me but a word .
peace , peace !
to brutus be that you seem , truly your country friend , and temperately proceed to what you would thus violently redress .
sir , those cold ways , that seem like prudent helps , are very poisonous where the disease is violent .
lay hands upon him , and bear him to the rock .
no , i die here .
drawing his sword there some among you have beheld me fighting come , try upon yourselves what you have seen me .
down with that sword !
tribunes , withdraw awhile .
lay hands upon him .
help marcius , help , you that be noble , help him , young and old !
down with him , down with him !
in this mutiny , the tribunes , the aediles , and the people , are beat in go , get you to your house , be gone , away !
all will be naught else .
get you gone .
stand fast , we have as many friends as enemies .
sham it be put to that ?
the gods forbid !
i prithee , noble friend , home to thy house , leave us to cure this cause .
for is a sore upon us , you can not tent yourself be gone , beseech you .
come , sir , along with us .
i would they were barbarians as they are , though in rome litter not romans as they are not , though calved i ' the porch o ' the capitol be gone , put not your worthy rage into your tongue , one time will owe another .
on fair ground i could beat forty of them .
i could myself take up a brace o ' the best of them , yea , the two tribunes but now is odds beyond arithmetic , and manhood is call foolery , when it stands against a falling fabric .
will you hence , before the tag return ?
whose rage doth rend like interrupted waters and what they are used to bear .
pray you , be gone i try whether my old wit be in request with those that have but little this must be patch with cloth of any colour .
nay , come away .
exeunt coriolanus , cominius , and others this man has marr his fortune .
his nature is too noble for the world he would not flatter neptune for his trident , or jove for power to thunder .
his heart his mouth what his breast forges , that his tongue must vent , and , being angry , does forget that ever he heard the name of death .
a noise within here goodly work !
i would they were abed !
i would they were in tiber !
what the vengeance !
could he not speak fair ?
brutus and sicinius , with the rabble where is this viper that would depopulate the city and be every man himself ?
you worthy tribunes , he shall be thrown down the tarpeian rock with rigorous hands he hath resisted law , and therefore law shall scorn him further trial than the severity of the public power which he so sets at nought .
he shall well know the noble tribunes are the people mouths , and we their hands .
he shall , sure o .
sir , sir , peace !
do not cry havoc , where you should but hunt with modest warrant .
sir , how that you have holp to make this rescue ?
hear me speak as i do know the consul worthiness , so can i name his faults , consul !
what consul ?
the consul coriolanus .
he consul !
no , no , no , no , no .
if , by the tribunes ' leave , and yours , good people , i may be heard , i would crave a word or two , the which shall turn you to no further harm than so much loss of time .
speak briefly then , for we are peremptory to dispatch this viperous traitor to eject him hence were but one danger , and to keep him here our certain death therefore it is decreed he dies .
now the good gods forbid that our renowned rome , whose gratitude towards her deserved children is enroll in jove own book , like an unnatural dam should now eat up her own !
he a disease that must be cut away .
o , he a limb that has but a disease , mortal , to cut it off , to cure it , easy .
what has he done to rome that worthy death ?
killing our enemies , the blood he hath lost which , i dare vouch , is more than that he hath , by many an ounce he dropp it for his country , and what is left , to lose it by his country , were to us all , that and suffer it , a brand to the end o ' the world .
this is clean kam .
merely awry when he did love his country , it honour him .
the service of the foot being once gangrened , is not then respected for what before it was .
we hear no more .
pursue him to his house , and pluck him thence lest his infection , being of catching nature , spread further .
one word more , one word .
this rage , when it shall find the harm of unscann swiftness , will too late tie leaden pounds to heels .
proceed by process , lest parties , as he is beloved , break out , and sack great rome with romans .
if it were so , what do ye talk ?
have we not had a taste of his obedience ?
our aediles smote ?
ourselves resisted ?
come .
consider this he has been bred i ' the wars since he could draw a sword , and is ill school in bolted language , meal and bran together he throws without distinction .
give me leave , i go to him , and undertake to bring him where he shall answer , by a lawful form , in peace , to his utmost peril .
noble tribunes , it is the humane way the other course will prove too bloody , and the end of it unknown to the beginning .
noble menenius , be you then as the people officer .
masters , lay down your weapons .
go not home .
meet on the .
we attend you there where , if you bring not marcius , we proceed in our first way .
i bring him to you .
to the senators let me desire your company he must come , or what is worst will follow .
pray you , let to him .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in coriolanus house .
enter coriolanus with patricians let them puff all about mine ears , present me death on the wheel or at wild horses ' heels , or pile ten hills on the tarpeian rock , that the precipitation might down stretch below the beam of sight , yet will i still be thus to them .
you do the nobler .
i muse my mother does not approve me further , who was wont to call them woollen vassals , things created to buy and sell with groats , to show bare heads in congregations , to yawn , be still and wonder , when one but of my ordinance stood up to speak of peace or war .
enter volumnia i talk of you why did you wish me milder ?
would you have me false to my nature ?
rather say i play the man i am .
o , sir , sir , sir , i would have had you put your power well on , before you had worn it out .
let go .
you might have been enough the man you are , with striving less to be so , lesser had been the thwartings of your dispositions , if you had not show them how ye were disposed ere they lack power to cross you .
let them hang .
ay , and burn too .
enter menenius and senators come , come , you have been too rough , something too rough , you must return and mend it .
there no remedy , unless , by not so doing , our good city cleave in the midst , and perish .
pray , be counsell i have a heart as little apt as yours , but yet a brain that leads my use of anger to better vantage .
well said , noble woman ?
before he should thus stoop to the herd , but that the violent fit o ' the time craves it as physic for the whole state , i would put mine armour on , which i can scarcely bear .
what must i do ?
return to the tribunes .
well , what then ?
what then ?
repent what you have spoke .
for them !
i can not do it to the gods , must i then to them ?
you are too absolute , though therein you can never be too noble , but when extremities speak .
i have heard you say , honour and policy , like unsever friends , i ' the war do grow together grant that , and tell me , in peace what each of them by the other lose , that they combine not there .
tush , tush !
a good demand .
if it be honour in your wars to seem the same you are not , which , for your best ends , you adopt your policy , how is it less or worse , that it shall hold companionship in peace with honour , as in war , since that to both it stands in like request ?
why force you this ?
because that now it lies you on to speak to the people , not by your own instruction , nor by the matter which your heart prompts you , but with such words that are but rooted in your tongue , though but bastards and syllables of no allowance to your bosom truth .
now , this no more dishonours you at all than to take in a town with gentle words , which else would put you to your fortune and the hazard of much blood .
i would dissemble with my nature where my fortunes and my friends at stake required i should do so in honour i am in this , your wife , your son , these senators , the nobles , and you will rather show our general louts how you can frown than spend a fawn upon , for the inheritance of their loves and safeguard of what that want might ruin .
noble lady !
come , go with us , speak fair you may salve so , not what is dangerous present , but the loss of what is past .
i prithee now , my son , go to them , with this bonnet in thy hand , and thus far having stretch it here be with them thy knee bussing the stones for in such business action is eloquence , and the eyes of the ignorant more learned than the ears waving thy head , which often , thus , correcting thy stout heart , now humble as the ripest mulberry that will not hold the handling or say to them , thou art their soldier , and being bred in broils hast not the soft way which , thou dost confess , were fit for thee to use as they to claim , in asking their good loves , but thou wilt frame thyself , forsooth , hereafter theirs , so far as thou hast power and person .
this but done , even as she speaks , why , their hearts were yours , for they have pardons , being ask , as free as words to little purpose .
prithee now , go , and be ruled although i know thou hadst rather follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf than flatter him in a bower .
here is cominius .
enter cominius i have been i ' the , and , sir , is fit you make strong party , or defend yourself by calmness or by absence all in anger .
only fair speech .
i think serve , if he can thereto frame his spirit .
he must , and will prithee now , say you will , and go about it .
must i go show them my unbarbed sconce ?
must i with base tongue give my noble heart a lie that it must bear ?
well , i will yet , were there but this single plot to lose , this mould of marcius , they to dust should grind it and against the wind .
to the !
you have put me now to such a part which never i shall discharge to the life .
come , come , we prompt you .
i prithee now , sweet son , as thou hast said my praises made thee first a soldier , so , to have my praise for this , perform a part thou hast not done before .
well , i must away , my disposition , and possess me some harlot spirit !
my throat of war be turn , which quired with my drum , into a pipe small as an eunuch , or the virgin voice that babies lulls asleep !
the smiles of knaves tent in my cheeks , and schoolboys ' tears take up the glasses of my sight !
a beggar tongue make motion through my lips , and my arm knees , who bow but in my stirrup , bend like his that hath received an alms !
i will not , lest i surcease to honour mine own truth and by my body action teach my mind a most inherent baseness .
at thy choice , then to beg of thee , it is my more dishonour than thou of them .
come all to ruin , let thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear thy dangerous stoutness , for i mock at death with as big heart as thou .
do as thou list thy valiantness was mine , thou it from me , but owe thy pride thyself .
pray , be content mother , i am going to the , chide me no more .
i mountebank their loves , cog their hearts from them , and come home beloved of all the trades in rome .
look , i am going commend me to my wife .
i return consul , or never trust to what my tongue can do i ' the way of flattery further .
do your will .
exit away !
the tribunes do attend you arm yourself to answer mildly , for they are prepared with accusations , as i hear , more strong than are upon you yet .
the word is . '
pray you , let us go let them accuse me by invention , i will answer in mine honour .
ay , but mildly .
well , mildly be it then .
mildly !

how accompanied ?
with old menenius , and those senators that always favour him .
have you a catalogue of all the voices that we have procured set down by the poll ?
i have , is ready .
have you collected them by tribes ?
i have .
assemble presently the people hither , and when they bear me say shall be so i ' the right and strength o ' the commons , ' be it either for death , for fine , or banishment , then let them if i say fine , cry , ' if death , cry . '
insisting on the old prerogative and power i ' the truth o ' the cause .
i shall inform them .
and when such time they have begun to cry , let them not cease , but with a din confused enforce the present execution of what we chance to sentence .
very well .
make them be strong and ready for this hint , when we shall hap to give them .
go about it .
exit aedile put him to choler straight he hath been used ever to conquer , and to have his worth of contradiction being once chafed , he can not be rein again to temperance , then he speaks what in his heart , and that is there which looks with us to break his neck .
well , here he comes .
enter coriolanus , menenius , and cominius , with senators and patricians calmly , i do beseech you .
ay , as an ostler , that for the poorest piece will bear the knave by the volume .

throng our large temples with the shows of peace , and not our streets with war !
amen , amen .

aedile , with citizens draw near , ye people .
list to your tribunes .
audience peace , i say !
first , hear me speak .
well , say .
peace , ho !
shall i be charged no further than this present ?
must all determine here ?
i do demand , if you submit you to the people voices , allow their officers and are content to suffer lawful censure for such faults as shall be proved upon you ?
i am content .
lo , citizens , he says he is content the warlike service he has done , consider , think upon the wounds his body bears , which show like graves i ' the holy churchyard .
scratches with briers , scars to move laughter only .
consider further , that when he speaks not like a citizen , you find him like a soldier do not take his rougher accents for malicious sounds , but , as i say , such as become a soldier , rather than envy you .
well , well , no more .
what is the matter that being pass for consul with full voice , i am so dishonour that the very hour you take it off again ?
answer to us .
say , then is true , i ought so .
we charge you , that you have contrived to take from rome all season office and to wind yourself into a power tyrannical , for which you are a traitor to the people .
how !
traitor !
nay , temperately , your promise .
the fires i ' the lowest hell the people !
call me their traitor !
thou injurious tribune !
within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths , in thy hand clutch as many millions , in thy lying tongue both numbers , i would say liest ' unto thee with a voice as free as i do pray the gods .
mark you this , people ?
to the rock , to the rock with him !
peace !
we need not put new matter to his charge what you have seen him do and heard him speak , beating your officers , cursing yourselves , opposing laws with strokes and here defying those whose great power must try him , even this , so criminal and in such capital kind , deserves the extremest death .
but since he hath served well for rome , what do you prate of service ?
i talk of that , that know it .
you ?
is this the promise that you made your mother ?
know , i pray you , i know no further let them pronounce the steep tarpeian death , vagabond exile , raying , pent to linger but with a grain a day , i would not buy their mercy at the price of one fair word , nor cheque my courage for what they can give , to with saying morrow . '
for that he has , as much as in him lies , from time to time envied against the people , seeking means to pluck away their power , as now at last given hostile strokes , and that not in the presence of dreaded justice , but on the ministers that do distribute it , in the name o ' the people and in the power of us the tribunes , we , even from this instant , banish him our city , in peril of precipitation from off the rock tarpeian never more to enter our rome gates i ' the people name , i say it shall be so .
it shall be so , it shall be so , let him away he banish , and it shall be so .
hear me , my masters , and my common friends , he sentenced , no more hearing .
let me speak i have been consul , and can show for rome her enemies ' marks upon me .
i do love my country good with a respect more tender , more holy and profound , than mine own life , my dear wife estimate , her womb increase , and treasure of my loins , then if i would speak that , we know your drift speak what ?
there no more to be said , but he is banish , as enemy to the people and his country it shall be so .
it shall be so , it shall be so .
you common cry of curs !
whose breath i hate as reek o ' the rotten fens , whose loves i prize as the dead carcasses of unburied men that do corrupt my air , i banish you , and here remain with your uncertainty !
let every feeble rumour shake your hearts !
your enemies , with nodding of their plumes , fan you into despair !
have the power still to banish your defenders , till at length your ignorance , which finds not till it feels , making not reservation of yourselves , still your own foes , deliver you as most abated captives to some nation that won you without blows !

no .

you had more beard when i last saw you , but your favour is well approved by your tongue .
what the news in rome ?
i have a note from the volscian state , to find you out there you have well saved me a day journey .
there hath been in rome strange insurrections , the people against the senators , patricians , and nobles .
hath been !
is it ended , then ?
our state thinks not so they are in a most warlike preparation , and hope to come upon them in the heat of their division .
the main blaze of it is past , but a small thing would make it flame again for the nobles receive so to heart the banishment of that worthy coriolanus , that they are in a ripe aptness to take all power from the people and to pluck from them their tribunes for ever .
this lies glowing , i can tell you , and is almost mature for the violent breaking out .
coriolanus banished !
banished , sir .
you will be welcome with this intelligence , nicanor .
the day serves well for them now .
i have heard it said , the fittest time to corrupt a man wife is when she fallen out with her husband .
your noble tullus aufidius will appear well in these wars , his great opposer , coriolanus , being now in no request of his country .
he can not choose .
i am most fortunate , thus accidentally to encounter you you have ended my business , and i will merrily accompany you home .
i shall , between this and supper , tell you most strange things from rome , all tending to the good of their adversaries .
have you an army ready , say you ?
a most royal one , the centurions and their charges , distinctly billeted , already in the entertainment , and to be on foot at an hour warning .
i am joyful to hear of their readiness , and am the man , i think , that shall set them in present action .
so , sir , heartily well met , and most glad of your company .
you take my part from me , sir , i have the most cause to be glad of yours .
well , let us go together .

thank you , sir farewell .
exit citizen o world , thy slippery turns !
friends now fast sworn , whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart , whose house , whose bed , whose meal , and exercise , are still together , who twin , as , in love unseparable , shall within this hour , on a dissension of a doit , break out to bitterest enmity so , fellest foes , whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep , to take the one the other , by some chance , some trick not worth an egg , shall grow dear friends and interjoin their issues .
so with me my hate i , and my love upon this enemy town .

thou pratest , and pratest , serve with thy trencher , hence !
beats him away .
exit third servingman enter aufidius with the second servingman where is this fellow ?
here , sir have beaten him like a dog , but for disturbing the lords within .
retires whence comest thou ?
what wouldst thou ?
thy name ?
why not ?
speak , man what thy name ?
if , tullus , unmuffling not yet thou knowest me , and , seeing me , dost not think me for the man i am , necessity commands me name myself .
what is thy name ?
a name unmusical to the volscians ' ears , and harsh in sound to thine .
say , what thy name ?
thou hast a grim appearance , and thy face bears a command i , though thy tackle torn .
thou a noble vessel what thy name ?
prepare thy brow to frown thou me yet ?
i know thee not thy name ?
my name is caius marcius , who hath done to thee particularly and to all the volsces great hurt and mischief , thereto witness may my surname , coriolanus the painful service , the extreme dangers and the drops of blood shed for my thankless country are requited but with that surname , a good memory , and witness of the malice and displeasure which thou shouldst bear me only that name remains , the cruelty and envy of the people , permitted by our dastard nobles , who have all forsook me , hath devour the rest , and suffer me by the voice of slaves to be whoop out of rome .
now this extremity hath brought me to thy hearth , not out of hope mistake me not to save my life , for if i had fear death , of all the men i ' the world i would have thee , but in mere spite , to be full quit of those my banishers , stand i before thee here .
then if thou hast a heart of wreak in thee , that wilt revenge thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims of shame seen through thy country , speed thee straight , and make my misery serve thy turn so use it that my revengeful services may prove as benefits to thee , for i will fight against my canker country with the spleen of all the under fiends .
but if so be thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes tired , then , in a word , i also am longer to live most weary , and present my throat to thee and to thy ancient malice , which not to cut would show thee but a fool , since i have ever follow thee with hate , drawn tuns of blood out of thy country breast , and can not live but to thy shame , unless it be to do thee service .
o marcius , marcius !
each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart a root of ancient envy .
if jupiter should from yond cloud speak divine things , and say is true , ' not believe them more than thee , all noble marcius .
let me twine mine arms about that body , where against my grained ash an hundred times hath broke and scarr the moon with splinters here i clip the anvil of my sword , and do contest as hotly and as nobly with thy love as ever in ambitious strength i did contend against thy valour .
know thou first , i loved the maid i married , never man sigh truer breath , but that i see thee here , thou noble thing !
more dances my rapt heart than when i first my wedded mistress saw bestride my threshold .
why , thou mars !
i tell thee , we have a power on foot , and i had purpose once more to hew thy target from thy brawn , or lose mine arm fort thou hast beat me out twelve several times , and i have nightly since dreamt of encounters thyself and me , we have been down together in my sleep , unbuckling helms , fisting each other throat , and waked half dead with nothing .
worthy marcius , had we no quarrel else to rome , but that thou art thence banish , we would muster all from twelve to seventy , and pouring war into the bowels of ungrateful rome , like a bold flood .
o , come , go in , and take our friendly senators by the hands , who now are here , taking their leaves of me , who am prepared against your territories , though not for rome itself .
you bless me , gods !
therefore , most absolute sir , if thou wilt have the leading of thine own revenges , take the one half of my commission , and set down as best thou art experienced , since thou thy country strength and weakness , thine own ways , whether to knock against the gates of rome , or rudely visit them in parts remote , to fright them , ere destroy .
but come in let me commend thee first to those that shall say yea to thy desires .
a thousand welcomes !
and more a friend than an enemy , yet , marcius , that was much .
your hand most welcome !
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius .
the two servingmen come forward here a strange alteration !
by my hand , i had thought to have strucken him with a cudgel , and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a false report of him .
what an arm he has !
he turned me about with his finger and his thumb , as one would set up a top .
nay , i knew by his face that there was something in him he had , sir , a kind of face , methought , i can not tell how to term it .
he had so , looking as it were would i were hanged , but i thought there was more in him than i could think .
so did i , i be sworn he is simply the rarest man i ' the world .
i think he is but a greater soldier than he you wot on .
who , my master ?
nay , it no matter for that .
worth six on him .
nay , not so neither but i take him to be the greater soldier .
faith , look you , one can not tell how to say that for the defence of a town , our general is excellent .
ay , and for an assault too .
third servingman o slaves , i can tell you news , news , you rascals !
what , what , what ?
let partake .
i would not be a roman , of all nations , i had as lieve be a condemned man .
wherefore ?
wherefore ?
why , here he that was wont to thwack our general , caius marcius .
why do you say our general ' ?
i do not say our general , ' but he was always good enough for him .
come , we are fellows and friends he was ever too hard for him , i have heard him say so himself .
he was too hard for him directly , to say the troth o before corioli he scotched him and notched him like a carbon ado .
an he had been cannibally given , he might have broiled and eaten him too .
but , more of thy news ?
why , he is so made on here within , as if he were son and heir to mars , set at upper end o ' the table , no question asked him by any of the senators , but they stand bald before him our general himself makes a mistress of him sanctifies himself with hand and turns up the white o ' the eye to his discourse .
but the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i ' the middle and but one half of what he was yesterday , for the other has half , by the entreaty and grant of the whole table .
he go , he says , and sowl the porter of rome gates by the ears he will mow all down before him , and leave his passage polled .
and he as like to as any man i can imagine .
!
he will , for , look you , sir , he has as many friends as enemies , which friends , sir , as it were , durst not , look you , sir , show themselves , as we term it , his friends whilst he in directitude .
directitude !
what that ?
but when they shall see , sir , his crest up again , and the man in blood , they will out of their burrows , like conies after rain , and revel all with him .
but when goes this forward ?
, , presently , you shall have the drum struck up this afternoon is , as it were , a parcel of their feast , and to be executed ere they wipe their lips .
why , then we shall have a stirring world again .
this peace is nothing , but to rust iron , increase tailors , and breed .
let me have war , say i , it exceeds peace as far as day does night , it spritely , waking , audible , and full of vent .
peace is a very apoplexy , lethargy , mulled , deaf , sleepy , insensible , a getter of more bastard children than war a destroyer of men .
is so and as war , in some sort , may be said to be a ravisher , so it can not be denied but peace is a great maker of cuckolds .
ay , and it makes men hate one another .
reason , because they then less need one another .
the wars for my money .
i hope to see romans as cheap as volscians .
they are rising , they are rising .
in , in , in , in !
exeunt scene vi .
rome .
a public place .
enter sicinius and brutus we hear not of him , neither need we fear him , his remedies are tame i ' the present peace and quietness of the people , which before were in wild hurry .
here do we make his friends blush that the world goes well , who rather had , though they themselves did suffer , behold dissentious numbers pestering streets than see our tradesmen with in their shops and going about their functions friendly .
we stood in good time .
enter menenius is this menenius ?
is he , is he o , he is grown most kind of late .
hail sir !
hail to you both !
your coriolanus is not much miss , but with his friends the commonwealth doth stand , and so would do , were he more angry at it .
all well , and might have been much better , if he could have temporized .
where is he , hear you ?
nay , i hear nothing his mother and his wife hear nothing from him .
enter three or four citizens the gods preserve you both !
, our neighbours .
to you all , to you all .
ourselves , our wives , and children , on our knees , are bound to pray for you both .
live , and thrive !
farewell , kind neighbours we wish coriolanus had loved you as we did .
now the gods keep you !
farewell , farewell .
exeunt citizens this is a happier and more comely time than when these fellows ran about the streets , crying confusion .
caius marcius was a worthy officer i ' the war , but insolent , with pride , ambitious past all thinking , , and affecting one sole throne , without assistance .
i think not so .
we should by this , to all our lamentation , if he had gone forth consul , found it so .
the gods have well prevented it , and rome sits safe and still without him .
enter an aedile worthy tribunes , there is a slave , whom we have put in prison , reports , the volsces with two several powers are enter in the roman territories , and with the deepest malice of the war destroy what lies before .
is aufidius , who , hearing of our marcius ' banishment , thrusts forth his horns again into the world , which were inshell when marcius stood for rome , and durst not once peep out .
come , what talk you of marcius ?
go see this rumourer whipp .
it can not be the volsces dare break with us .
can not be !
we have record that very well it can , and three examples of the like have been within my age .
but reason with the fellow , before you punish him , where he heard this , lest you shall chance to whip your information and beat the messenger who bids beware of what is to be dreaded .
tell not me i know this can not be .
not possible .
enter a messenger the nobles in great earnestness are going all to the some news is come that turns their countenances .
is this slave , go whip him , the people eyes his raising , nothing but his report .
yes , worthy sir , the slave report is seconded , and more , more fearful , is deliver .
what more fearful ?
it is spoke freely out of many mouths how probable i do not know that marcius , join with aufidius , leads a power rome , and vows revenge as spacious as between the and oldest thing .
this is most likely !
raised only , that the weaker sort may wish good marcius home again .
the very trick o .
this is unlikely he and aufidius can no more atone than violentest contrariety .
enter a second messenger you are sent for to the senate a fearful army , led by caius marcius associated with aufidius , rages upon our territories , and have already their way , consumed with fire , and took what lay before them .
enter cominius o , you have made good work !
what news ?
what news ?
you have holp to ravish your own daughters and to melt the city leads upon your pates , to see your wives dishonour to your noses , what the news ?
what the news ?
your temples burned in their cement , and your franchises , whereon you stood , confined into an auger bore .
pray now , your news ?
you have made fair work , i fear pray , your news ? if marcius should be join with volscians , if !
he is their god he leads them like a thing made by some other deity than nature , that shapes man better , and they follow him , against us brats , with no less confidence than boys pursuing summer butterflies , or butchers killing flies .
you have made good work , you and your , you that stood so up much on the voice of occupation and the breath of !
he will shake your rome about your ears .
as hercules did shake down mellow fruit .
you have made fair work !
but is this true , sir ?
ay , and you look pale before you find it other .
all the regions do smilingly revolt , and who resist are mock for valiant ignorance , and perish constant fools .
who can blame him ?
your enemies and his find something in him .
we are all undone , unless the noble man have mercy .
who shall ask it ?
the tribunes can not for shame , the people deserve such pity of him as the wolf does of the shepherds for his best friends , if they should say good to rome , ' they charged him even as those should do that had deserved his hate , and therein show like enemies .
is true if he were putting to my house the brand that should consume it , i have not the face to say you , cease . '
you have made fair hands , you and your crafts !
you have crafted fair !
you have brought a trembling upon rome , such as was never so incapable of help .
say not we brought it .
how !
was it we ?
we loved him but , like beasts and cowardly nobles , gave way unto your clusters , who did hoot him out o ' the city .
but i fear they roar him in again .
tullus aufidius , the second name of men , obeys his points as if he were his officer desperation is all the policy , strength and defence , that rome can make against them .
enter a troop of citizens here come the clusters .
and is aufidius with him ?
you are they that made the air unwholesome , when you cast your stinking greasy caps in hooting at coriolanus ' exile .
now he coming , and not a hair upon a soldier head which will not prove a whip as many coxcombs as you threw caps up will he tumble down , and pay you for your voices .
is no matter , if he could burn us all into one coal , we have deserved it .
faith , we hear fearful news .
for mine own part , when i said , banish him , i said was pity .
and so did i .
and so did i , and , to say the truth , so did very many of us that we did , we did for the best , and though we willingly consented to his banishment , yet it was against our will .
ye re goodly things , you voices !
you have made good work , you and your cry !
shall to the capitol ?
o , ay , what else ?
exeunt cominius and menenius go , masters , get you home , be not dismay these are a side that would be glad to have this true which they so seem to fear .
go home , and show no sign of fear .
the gods be good to us !
come , masters , let home .
i ever said we were i ' the wrong when we banished him .
so did we all .
but , come , let home .
exeunt citizens i do not like this news .
nor i .
let to the capitol .
would half my wealth would buy this for a lie !
pray , let us go .
exeunt scene vii .
a camp , at a small distance from rome .
enter aufidius and his lieutenant do they still fly to the roman ?
i do not know what witchcraft in him , but your soldiers use him as the grace meat , their talk at table , and their thanks at end , and you are darken in this action , sir , even by your own .
i can not help it now , unless , by using means , i lame the foot of our design .
he bears himself more proudlier , even to my person , than i thought he would when first i did embrace him yet his nature in that no changeling , and i must excuse what can not be amended .
yet i wish , sir , i mean for your particular , you had not join in commission with him , but either had borne the action of yourself , or else to him had left it solely .
i understand thee well , and be thou sure , when he shall come to his account , he knows not what i can urge against him .
although it seems , and so he thinks , and is no less apparent to the vulgar eye , that he bears all things fairly .
and shows good husbandry for the volscian state , fights , and does achieve as soon as draw his sword , yet he hath left undone that which shall break his neck or hazard mine , we come to our account .
sir , i beseech you , think you he carry rome ?
all places yield to him ere he sits down , and the nobility of rome are his the senators and patricians love him too the tribunes are no soldiers , and their people will be as rash in the repeal , as hasty to expel him thence .
i think he be to rome as is the osprey to the fish , who takes it by sovereignty of nature .
first he was a noble servant to them , but he could not carry his honours even whether was pride , which out of daily fortune ever taints the happy man , whether defect of judgment , to fail in the disposing of those chances which he was lord of , or whether nature , not to be other than one thing , not moving from the casque to the cushion , but commanding peace even with the same austerity and garb as he controll the war , but one of these as he hath spices of them all , not all , for i dare so far free him made him fear , so hated , and so banish but he has a merit , to choke it in the utterance .
so our virtues lie in the interpretation of the time and power , unto itself most commendable , hath not a tomb so evident as a chair to extol what it hath done .
one fire drives out one fire , one nail , one nail , rights by rights falter , strengths by strengths do fail .
come , let away .
when , caius , rome is thine , thou art of all , then shortly art thou mine .
exeunt act v scene rome .
a public place .
enter menenius , cominius , sicinius , brutus , and others no , i not go you hear what he hath said which was sometime his general , who loved him in a most dear particular .
he call me father but what o ' that ?
go , you that banish him , a mile before his tent fall down , and knee the way into his mercy nay , if he coy to hear cominius speak , i keep at home .
he would not seem to know me .
do you hear ?
yet one time he did call me by my name i urged our old acquaintance , and the drops that we have bled together .
coriolanus he would not answer to forbad all names , he was a kind of nothing , titleless , till he had forged himself a name o ' the fire of burning rome .
why , so you have made good work !
a pair of tribunes that have rack for rome , to make coals cheap , a noble memory !
i minded him how royal was to pardon when it was less expected he replied , it was a bare petition of a state to one whom they had punish .
very well could he say less ?
i offer to awaken his regard for private friends his answer to me was , he could not stay to pick them in a pile of noisome musty chaff he said was folly , for one poor grain or two , to leave unburnt , and still to nose the offence .
for one poor grain or two !
i am one of those , his mother , wife , his child , and this brave fellow too , we are the grains you are the musty chaff , and you are smelt above the moon we must be burnt for you .
nay , pray , be patient if you refuse your aid in this so help , yet do not upbraid with our distress .
but , sure , if you would be your country pleader , your good tongue , more than the instant army we can make , might stop our countryman .
no , i not meddle .
pray you , go to him .
what should i do ?
only make trial what your love can do for rome , towards marcius .
well , and say that marcius return me , as cominius is return , unheard , what then ?
but as a discontented friend , with his unkindness ?
be so ?
yet your good will must have that thanks from rome , after the measure as you intended well .
i undertake i think he hear me .
yet , to bite his lip and hum at good cominius , much unhearts me .
he was not taken well , he had not dined the veins unfill , our blood is cold , and then we pout upon the morning , are unapt to give or to forgive , but when we have stuff these and these conveyances of our blood with wine and feeding , we have suppler souls than in our fasts therefore i watch him till he be dieted to my request , and then i set upon him .
you know the very road into his kindness , and can not lose your way .
good faith , i prove him , speed how it will .
i shall ere long have knowledge of my success .
exit he never hear him .
not ?
i tell you , he does sit in gold , his eye red as burn rome , and his injury the gaoler to his pity .
i kneel before him , was very faintly he said , ' dismiss me thus , with his speechless hand what he would do , he sent in writing after me , what he would not , bound with an oath to yield to his conditions so that all hope is vain .
unless his noble mother , and his wife , who , as i hear , mean to solicit him for mercy to his country .
therefore , let hence , and with our fair entreaties haste them on .
exeunt scene ii .
entrance of the volscian camp before rome .
two sentinels on guard .
enter to them , menenius stay whence are you ?
stand , and go back .
you guard like men , is well but , by your leave , i am an officer of state , and come to speak with coriolanus .
from whence ?
from rome .
you may not pass , you must return our general will no more hear from thence .
you see your rome embraced with fire before you speak with coriolanus .
good my friends , if you have heard your general talk of rome , and of his friends there , it is lots to blanks , my name hath touch your ears it is menenius .
be it so , go back the virtue of your name is not here passable .
i tell thee , fellow , the general is my lover i have been the book of his good acts , whence men have read his name unparallel , haply amplified , for i have ever verified my friends , of whom he chief , with all the size that verity would without lapsing suffer nay , sometimes , like to a bowl upon a subtle ground , i have tumbled past the throw , and in his praise have almost stamp the leasing therefore , fellow , i must have leave to pass .
faith , sir , if you had told as many lies in his behalf as you have uttered words in your own , you should not pass here , no , though it were as virtuous to lie as to live chastely .
therefore , go back .
prithee , fellow , remember my name is menenius , always factionary on the party of your general .
howsoever you have been his liar , as you say you have , i am one that , telling true under him , must say , you can not pass .
therefore , go back .
has he dined , canst thou tell ?
for i would not speak with him till after dinner .
you are a roman , are you ?
i am , as thy general is .
then you should hate rome , as he does .
can you , when you have pushed out your gates the very defender of them , and , in a violent popular ignorance , given your enemy your shield , think to front his revenges with the easy groans of old women , the virginal palms of your daughters , or with the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as you seem to be ?
can you think to blow out the intended fire your city is ready to flame in , with such weak breath as this ?
no , you are deceived , therefore , back to rome , and prepare for your execution you are condemned , our general has sworn you out of reprieve and pardon .
sirrah , if thy captain knew i were here , he would use me with estimation .
come , my captain knows you not .
i mean , thy general .
my general cares not for you .
back , i say , go , lest i let forth your of blood , back , that the utmost of your having back .
nay , but , fellow , fellow , enter coriolanus and aufidius what the matter ?
now , you companion , i say an errand for you you shall know now that i am in estimation , you shall perceive that a jack guardant can not office me from my son coriolanus guess , but by my entertainment with him , if thou standest not i ' the state of hanging , or of some death more long in spectatorship , and crueller in suffering , behold now presently , and swoon for what to come upon thee .
to coriolanus the glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy particular prosperity , and love thee no worse than thy old father menenius does !
o my son , my son !
thou art preparing fire for us , look thee , here water to quench it .
i was hardly moved to come to thee , but being assured none but myself could move thee , i have been blown out of your gates with sighs , and conjure thee to pardon rome , and thy petitionary countrymen .
the good gods assuage thy wrath , and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet here , this , who , like a block , hath denied my access to thee .
away !
how !
away !
wife , mother , child , i know not .
my affairs are servanted to others though i owe my revenge properly , my remission lies in volscian breasts .
that we have been familiar , ingrate forgetfulness shall poison , rather than pity note how much .
therefore , be gone .
mine ears against your suits are stronger than your gates against my force .
yet , for i loved thee , take this along , i writ it for thy sake gives a letter and would have rent it .
another word , menenius , i will not hear thee speak .
this man , aufidius , was my beloved in rome yet thou !
you keep a constant temper .
exeunt coriolanus and aufidius now , sir , is your name menenius ?
is a spell , you see , of much power you know the way home again .
do you hear how we are shent for keeping your greatness back ?
what cause , do you think , i have to swoon ?
i neither care for the world nor your general for such things as you , i can scarce think there any , ye so slight .
he that hath a will to die by himself fears it not from another let your general do his worst .
for you , be that you are , long , and your misery increase with your age !
i say to you , as i was said to , away !
exit a noble fellow , i warrant him .
the worthy fellow is our general he the rock , the oak not to be .
exeunt scene iii .
the tent of coriolanus .
enter coriolanus , aufidius , and others we will before the walls of rome tomorrow set down our host .
my partner in this action , you must report to the volscian lords , how plainly i have borne this business .
only their ends you have respected , stopp your ears against the general suit of rome , never admitted a private whisper , no , not with such friends that thought them sure of you .
this last old man , whom with a crack heart i have sent to rome , loved me above the measure of a father , nay , godded me , indeed .
their latest refuge was to send him , for whose old love i have , though i show sourly to him , once more offer the first conditions , which they did refuse and can not now accept , to grace him only that thought he could do more , a very little i have yielded to fresh embassies and suits , nor from the state nor private friends , hereafter will i lend ear to .
ha !
what shout is this ?
shout within shall i be tempted to infringe my vow in the same time is made ?
i will not .
enter in mourning habits , virgilia , volumnia , leading young marcius , valeria , and attendants my wife comes foremost , then the honour mould wherein this trunk was framed , and in her hand the grandchild to her blood .
but , out , affection !
all bond and privilege of nature , break !
let it be virtuous to be obstinate .
what is that worth ?
or those doves ' eyes , which can make gods forsworn ?
i melt , and am not of stronger earth than others .
my mother bows , as if olympus to a molehill should in supplication nod and my young boy hath an aspect of intercession , which great nature cries not . '
let the volsces plough rome and harrow italy i never be such a gosling to obey instinct , but stand , as if a man were author of himself and knew no other kin .
my lord and husband !
these eyes are not the same i wore in rome .
the sorrow that delivers us thus changed makes you think so .
like a dull actor now , i have forgot my part , and i am out , even to a full disgrace .
best of my flesh , forgive my tyranny , but do not say for that our romans . '
o , a kiss long as my exile , sweet as my revenge !
now , by the jealous queen of heaven , that kiss i carried from thee , dear , and my true lip hath virgin it since .
you gods !
i prate , and the most noble mother of the world leave unsaluted sink , my knee , i ' the earth , kneels of thy deep duty more impression show than that of common sons .
o , stand up blest !
whilst , with no softer cushion than the flint , i kneel before thee , and unproperly show duty , as mistaken all this while between the child and parent .
kneels what is this ?
your knees to me ?
to your corrected son ?
then let the pebbles on the hungry beach fillip the stars , then let the mutinous winds strike the proud cedars the fiery sun , murdering impossibility , to make what can not be , slight work .
thou art my warrior , i holp to frame thee .
do you know this lady ?
the noble sister of publicola , the moon of rome , chaste as the icicle that curdied by the frost from purest snow and hangs on dian temple dear valeria !
this is a poor epitome of yours , which by the interpretation of full time may show like all yourself .
the god of soldiers , with the consent of supreme jove , inform thy thoughts with nobleness , that thou mayst prove to shame unvulnerable , and stick i ' the wars like a great , standing every flaw , and saving those that eye thee !
your knee , sirrah .
that my brave boy !
even he , your wife , this lady , and myself , are suitors to you .
i beseech you , peace or , if ask , remember this before the thing i have forsworn to grant may never be held by you denials .
do not bid me dismiss my soldiers , or capitulate again with rome mechanics tell me not wherein i seem unnatural desire not to ally my rages and revenges with your colder reasons .
o , no more , no more !
you have said you will not grant us any thing , for we have nothing else to ask , but that which you deny already yet we will ask , that , if you fail in our request , the blame may hang upon your hardness therefore hear us .
aufidius , and you volsces , mark , for we hear nought from rome in private .
your request ?
should we be silent and not speak , our raiment and state of bodies would bewray what life we have led since thy exile .
think with thyself how more unfortunate than all living women are we come hither since that thy sight , which should make our eyes flow with joy , hearts dance with comforts , constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow , making the mother , wife and child to see the son , the husband and the father tearing his country bowels out .
and to poor we thine enmity most capital thou us our prayers to the gods , which is a comfort that all but we enjoy , for how can we , alas , how can we for our country pray .
whereto we are bound , together with thy victory , whereto we are bound ?
alack , or we must lose the country , our dear nurse , or else thy person , our comfort in the country .
we must find an evident calamity , though we had our wish , which side should win for either thou must , as a foreign recreant , be led with manacles thorough our streets , or else triumphantly tread on thy country ruin , and bear the palm for having bravely shed thy wife and children blood .
for myself , son , i purpose not to wait on fortune till these wars determine if i can not persuade thee rather to show a noble grace to both parts than seek the end of one , thou shalt no sooner march to assault thy country than to tread trust , thou shalt not on thy mother womb , that brought thee to this world .
ay , and mine , that brought you forth this boy , to keep your name living to time .
a ' shall not tread on me , i run away till i am bigger , but then i fight .
not of a woman tenderness to be , requires nor child nor woman face to see .
i have sat too long .
rising nay , go not from us thus .
if it were so that our request did tend to save the romans , thereby to destroy the volsces whom you serve , you might condemn us , as poisonous of your honour no , our suit is that you reconcile them while the volsces may say mercy we have show , ' the romans , we received , ' and each in either side give the to thee and cry blest for making up this peace ! '
thou , great son , the end of war uncertain , but this certain , that , if thou conquer rome , the benefit which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name , whose repetition will be dogg with curses , whose chronicle thus writ man was noble , but with his last attempt he wiped it out , destroy his country , and his name remains to the ensuing age abhorr . '
speak to me , son thou hast affected the fine strains of honour , to imitate the graces of the gods , to tear with thunder the wide cheeks o ' the air , and yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt that should but rive an oak .
why dost not speak ?
thou it honourable for a noble man still to remember wrongs ?
daughter , speak you he cares not for your weeping .
speak thou , boy perhaps thy childishness will move him more than can our reasons .
there no man in the world more bound to mother , yet here he lets me prate like one i ' the stocks .
thou hast never in thy life show thy dear mother any courtesy , when she , poor hen , fond of no second brood , has cluck thee to the wars and safely home , loaden with honour .
say my request unjust , and spurn me back but if it be not so , thou art not honest , and the gods will plague thee , that thou from me the duty which to a mother part belongs .
he turns away down , ladies , let us shame him with our knees .
to his surname coriolanus more pride than pity to our prayers .
down an end , this is the last so we will home to rome , and die among our neighbours .
nay , behold this boy , that can not tell what he would have but kneels and holds up bands for fellowship , does reason our petition with more strength than thou hast to deny .
come , let us go this fellow had a volscian to his mother , his wife is in corioli and his child like him by chance .
yet give us our dispatch i am hush until our city be , and then i speak a little .
he holds her by the hand , silent o mother , mother !
what have you done ?
behold , the heavens do ope , the gods look down , and this unnatural scene they laugh at .
o my mother , mother !
o !
you have won a happy victory to rome , but , for your son , believe it , o , believe it , most dangerously you have with him prevail , if not most mortal to him .
but , let it come .
aufidius , though i can not make true wars , i frame convenient peace .
now , good aufidius , were you in my stead , would you have heard a mother less ?
or granted less , aufidius ?
i was moved withal .
i dare be sworn you were and , sir , it is no little thing to make mine eyes to sweat compassion .
but , good sir , what peace you make , advise me for my part , i not to rome , i back with you , and pray you , stand to me in this cause .
o mother !
wife !
aside i am glad thou hast set thy mercy and thy honour at difference in thee out of that i work myself a former fortune .
the ladies make signs to coriolanus ay , by and by , to volumnia , virgilia , and c but we will drink together , and you shall bear a better witness back than words , which we , on like conditions , will have .
come , enter with us .
ladies , you deserve to have a temple built you all the swords in italy , and her confederate arms , could not have made this peace .
exeunt scene iv .
rome .
a public place .
enter menenius and sicinius see you yond coign o ' the capitol , yond ?
why , what of that ?
if it be possible for you to displace it with your little finger , there is some hope the ladies of rome , especially his mother , may prevail with him .
but i say there is no hope i our throats are sentenced and stay upon execution .
possible that so short a time can alter the condition of a man !
there is differency between a grub and a butterfly , yet your butterfly was a grub .
this marcius is grown from man to dragon he has wings , he more than a creeping thing .
he loved his mother dearly .
so did he me and he no more remembers his mother now than an horse .
the tartness of his face sours ripe grapes when he walks , he moves like an engine , and the ground shrinks before his treading he is able to pierce a corslet with his eye , talks like a knell , and his hum is a battery .
he sits in his state , as a thing made for alexander .
what he bids be done is finished with his bidding .
he wants nothing of a god but eternity and a heaven to throne in .
yes , mercy , if you report him truly .
i paint him in the character .
mark what mercy his mother shall bring from him there is no more mercy in him than there is milk in a male tiger , that shall our poor city find and all this is long of you .
the gods be good unto us !
no , in such a case the gods will not be good unto us .
when we banished him , we respected not them , and , he returning to break our necks , they respect not us .
enter a messenger sir , if save your life , fly to your house the plebeians have got your and hale him up and down , all swearing , if the roman ladies bring not comfort home , they give him death by inches .
enter a second messenger what the news ?
good news , good news , the ladies have prevail , the volscians are dislodged , and marcius gone a merrier day did never yet greet rome , no , not the expulsion of the tarquins .
friend , art thou certain this is true ?
is it most certain ?
as certain as i know the sun is fire where have you lurk , that you make doubt of it ?
through an arch so hurried the blown tide , as the recomforted through the gates .
why , hark you !
trumpets , hautboys , drums beat , all together the trumpets , sackbuts , psalteries and fifes , tabours and cymbals and the shouting romans , make the sun dance .
hark you !
a shout within this is good news i will go meet the ladies .
this volumnia is worth of consuls , senators , patricians , a city full , of tribunes , such as you , a sea and land full .
you have pray well this morning for ten thousand of your throats i not have given a doit .
hark , how they joy !
music still , with shouts first , the gods bless you for your tidings , next , accept my thankfulness .
sir , we have all great cause to give great thanks .
they are near the city ?
almost at point to enter .
we will meet them , and help the joy .
exeunt scene the same .
a street near the gate .
enter two senators with volumnia , virgilia , valeria , and passing over the stage , followed by patricians and others behold our patroness , the life of rome !
call all your tribes together , praise the gods , and make triumphant fires , strew flowers before them unshout the noise that banish marcius , repeal him with the welcome of his mother , cry , ladies , welcome ! '
welcome , ladies , welcome !

exeunt scene vi .
antium .
a public place .
enter tullus aufidius , with attendants go tell the lords o ' the city i am here deliver them this paper having read it , bid them repair to the market place , where i , even in theirs and in the commons ' ears , will vouch the truth of it .
him i accuse the city ports by this hath enter and intends to appear before the people , hoping to purge herself with words dispatch .
exeunt attendants enter three or four conspirators of aufidius ' faction most welcome !
how is it with our general ?
even so as with a man by his own alms empoison , and with his charity slain .
most noble sir , if you do hold the same intent wherein you wish us parties , we deliver you of your great danger .
sir , i can not tell we must proceed as we do find the people .
the people will remain uncertain whilst you there difference , but the fall of either makes the survivor heir of all .
i know it , and my pretext to strike at him admits a good construction .
i raised him , and i pawn mine honour for his truth who being so heighten , he water his new plants with dews of flattery , seducing so my friends , and , to this end , he bow his nature , never known before but to be rough , unswayable and free .
sir , his stoutness when he did stand for consul , which he lost by lack of stooping , that i would have spoke of being banish , he came unto my hearth , presented to my knife his throat i took him , made him with me , gave him way in all his own desires , nay , let him choose out of my files , his projects to accomplish , my best and freshest men , served his designments in mine own person , holp to reap the fame which he did end all his , and took some pride to do myself this wrong till , at the last , i seem his follower , not partner , and he waged me with his countenance , as if i had been mercenary .
so he did , my lord the army marvell at it , and , in the last , when he had carried rome and that we look for no less spoil than glory , there was it for which my sinews shall be stretch upon him .
at a few drops of women rheum , which are as cheap as lies , he sold the blood and labour of our great action therefore shall he die , and i renew me in his fall .
but , hark !
drums and trumpets sound , with great shouts of the people your native town you enter like a post , and had no welcomes home but he returns , splitting the air with noise .
and patient fools , whose children he hath slain , their base throats tear with giving him glory .
therefore , at your vantage , ere he express himself , or move the people with what he would say , let him feel your sword , which we will second .
when he lies along , after your way his tale pronounced shall bury his reasons with his body .
say no more here come the lords .
enter the lords of the city you are most welcome home .
i have not deserved it .
but , worthy lords , have you with heed perused what i have written to you ?
we have .
and grieve to .
what faults he made before the last , i think might have found easy fines but there to end where he was to begin and give away the benefit of our levies , answering us with our own charge , making a treaty where there was a yielding , this admits no excuse .
he approaches you shall hear him .
enter coriolanus , marching with drum and colours , commoners being with him hail , lords !
i am return your soldier , no more infected with my country love than when i parted hence , but still subsisting under your great command .
you are to know that prosperously i have attempted and with bloody passage led your wars even to the gates of rome .
our spoils we have brought home do more than counterpoise a full third part the charges of the action .
we have made peace with no less honour to the antiates than shame to the romans and we here deliver , subscribed by the consuls and patricians , together with the seal o ' the senate , what we have compounded on .
read it not , noble lords , but tell the traitor , in the degree he hath abused your powers .
traitor !
how now !
ay , traitor , marcius !
marcius !
ay , marcius , caius marcius dost thou think i grace thee with that robbery , thy name coriolanus in corioli ?
you lords and heads o ' the state , perfidiously he has betray your business , and given up , for certain drops of salt , your city rome , i say city , ' to his wife and mother , breaking his oath and resolution like a twist of rotten silk , never admitting counsel o ' the war , but at his nurse tears he whined and roar away your victory , that pages blush at him and men of heart look wondering each at other .
thou , mars ?
name not the god , thou boy of tears !
ha !
no more .
measureless liar , thou hast made my heart too great for what contains it .
boy !
o slave !
pardon me , lords , is the first time that ever i was forced to scold .
your judgments , my grave lords , must give this cur the lie and his own notion who wears my stripes impress upon him , that must bear my beating to his grave shall join to thrust the lie unto him .
peace , both , and hear me speak .
cut me to pieces , volsces , men and lads , stain all your edges on me .
boy !
false hound !
if you have writ your annals true , is there , that , like an eagle in a , i flutter your volscians in corioli alone i did it .
boy !
why , noble lords , will you be put in mind of his blind fortune , which was your shame , by this unholy braggart , your own eyes and ears ?
let him die .

kill my son . '
daughter . '
killed my cousin marcus . '
killed my father . '
peace , ho !
no outrage peace !
the man is noble and his fame this orb o ' the earth .
his last offences to us shall have judicious hearing .
stand , aufidius , and trouble not the peace .
o that i had him , with six aufidiuses , or more , his tribe , to use my lawful sword !
insolent villain !
kill , kill , kill , kill , kill him !
the conspirators draw , and kill coriolanus aufidius stands on his body hold , hold , hold , hold !
my noble masters , hear me speak .
o tullus , thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep .
tread not upon him .
masters all , be quiet , put up your swords .
my lords , when you shall know as in this rage , provoked by him , you can not the great danger which this man life did owe you , you rejoice that he is thus cut off .
please it your honours to call me to your senate , i deliver myself your loyal servant , or endure your heaviest censure .
bear from hence his body , and mourn you for him let him be regarded as the most noble corse that ever herald did follow to his urn .
his own impatience takes from aufidius a great part of blame .
let make the best of it .
my rage is gone , and i am struck with sorrow .
take him up .
help , three o ' the chiefest soldiers , i be one .
beat thou the drum , that it speak mournfully trail your steel pikes .

a dead march sounded act i scene britain .
the garden of cymbeline palace .
enter two gentlemen you do not meet a man but frowns our bloods no more obey the heavens than our courtiers still seem as does the king .
but what the matter ?
his daughter , and the heir of kingdom , whom he purposed to his wife sole son a widow that late he married hath referr herself unto a poor but worthy gentleman she wedded , her husband banish , she imprison all is outward sorrow , though i think the king be touch at very heart .
none but the king ?
he that hath lost her too , so is the queen , that most desired the match , but not a courtier , although they wear their faces to the bent of the king look , hath a heart that is not glad at the thing they scowl at .
and why so ?
he that hath miss the princess is a thing too bad for bad report and he that hath her i mean , that married her , alack , good man !
and therefore banish is a creature such as , to seek through the regions of the earth for one his like , there would be something failing in him that should compare .
i do not think so fair an outward and such stuff within endows a man but he .
you speak him far .
i do extend him , sir , within himself , crush him together rather than unfold his measure duly .
what his name and birth ?
i can not delve him to the root his father was call sicilius , who did join his honour against the romans with cassibelan , but had his titles by tenantius whom he served with glory and admired success , so gain the leonatus , and had , besides this gentleman in question , two other sons , who in the wars o ' the time died with their swords in hand , for which their father , then old and fond of issue , took such sorrow that he quit being , and his gentle lady , big of this gentleman our theme , deceased as he was born .
the king he takes the babe to his protection , calls him posthumus leonatus , breeds him and makes him of his , puts to him all the learnings that his time could make him the receiver of , which he took , as we do air , fast as was minister , and in spring became a harvest , lived in court which rare it is to do most praised , most loved , a sample to the youngest , to the more mature a glass that feated them , and to the graver a child that guided dotards , to his mistress , for whom he now is banish , her own price proclaims how she esteem him and his virtue , by her election may be truly read what kind of man he is .
i honour him even out of your report .
but , pray you , tell me , is she sole child to the king ?
his only child .
he had two sons if this be worth your hearing , mark it the eldest of them at three years old , i ' the the other , from their nursery were , and to this hour no guess in knowledge which way they went .
how long is this ago ?
some twenty years .
that a king children should be so convey , so slackly guarded , and the search so slow , that could not trace them !
is strange , or that the negligence may well be laugh at , yet is it true , sir .
i do well believe you .
we must forbear here comes the gentleman , the queen , and princess .
exeunt enter the queen , posthumus leonatus , and imogen no , be assured you shall not find me , daughter , after the slander of most stepmothers , unto you you my prisoner , but your gaoler shall deliver you the keys that lock up your restraint .
for you , posthumus , so soon as i can win the offended king , i will be known your advocate marry , yet the fire of rage is in him , and good you lean unto his sentence with what patience your wisdom may inform you .
please your highness , i will from hence .
you know the peril .
i fetch a turn about the garden , pitying the pangs of barr affections , though the king hath charged you should not speak together .
exit o dissembling courtesy !
how fine this tyrant can tickle where she wounds !
my dearest husband , i something fear my father wrath , but nothing always reserved my holy duty what his rage can do on me you must be gone , and i shall here abide the hourly shot of angry eyes , not comforted to live , but that there is this jewel in the world that i may see again .
my queen !
my mistress !
o lady , weep no more , lest i give cause to be suspected of more tenderness than doth become a man .
i will remain the husband that did plight troth my residence in rome at one philario , who to my father was a friend , to me known but by letter thither write , my queen , and with mine eyes i drink the words you send , though ink be made of gall .
queen be brief , i pray you if the king come , i shall incur i know not how much of his displeasure .
aside yet i move him to walk this way i never do him wrong , but he does buy my injuries , to be friends , pays dear for my offences .
exit should we be taking leave as long a term as yet we have to live , the loathness to depart would grow .
adieu !
nay , stay a little were you but riding forth to air yourself , such parting were too petty .
look here , love , this diamond was my mother take it , heart , but keep it till you woo another wife , when imogen is dead .
how , how !
another ?
you gentle gods , give me but this i have , and sear up my embracements from a next with bonds of death !
putting on the ring remain , remain thou here while sense can keep it on .
and , sweetest , fairest , as i my poor self did exchange for you , to your so infinite loss , so in our trifles i still win of you for my sake wear this , it is a manacle of love , i place it upon this fairest prisoner .
putting a bracelet upon her arm o the gods !
when shall we see again ?
enter cymbeline and lords alack , the king !
thou basest thing , avoid !

if after this command thou fraught the court with thy unworthiness , thou diest away !

the gods protect you !
and bless the good remainders of the court !
i am gone .
exit there can not be a pinch in death more sharp than this is .
o disloyal thing , that shouldst repair my youth , thou a year age on me .
i beseech you , sir , harm not yourself with your vexation i am senseless of your wrath , a touch more rare subdues all pangs , all fears .
past grace ?
obedience ?
past hope , and in despair , that way , past grace .
that mightst have had the sole son of my queen !
o blest , that i might not !
i chose an eagle , and did avoid a puttock .
thou a beggar , wouldst have made my throne a seat for baseness .
no , i rather added a lustre to it .
o thou vile one !
sir , it is your fault that i have loved posthumus you bred him as my playfellow , and he is a man worth any woman , overbuys me almost the sum he pays .
what , art thou mad ?
almost , sir heaven restore me !
would i were a daughter , and my leonatus our neighbour shepherd son !
thou foolish thing !
queen they were again together you have done not after our command .
away with her , and pen her up .
beseech your patience .
peace , dear lady daughter , peace !
sweet sovereign , leave us to ourselves , and make yourself some comfort out of your best advice .
nay , let her languish a drop of blood a day , and , being aged , die of this folly !

i am very glad o .

to draw upon an exile !
o brave sir !
i would they were in afric both together , myself by with a needle , that i might prick the .
why came you from your master ?
on his command he would not suffer me to bring him to the haven , left these notes of what commands i should be subject to , when pleased you to employ me .

if my shirt were bloody , then to shift it .
have i hurt him ?
aside no , , not so much as his patience .
hurt him !
his body a passable carcass , if he be not hurt it is a thoroughfare for steel , if it be not hurt .
aside his steel was in debt , it went o ' the backside the town .
the villain would not stand me .
aside no , but he fled forward still , toward your face .
stand you !
you have land enough of your own but he added to your having , gave you some ground .
aside as many inches as you have oceans .
puppies !
i would they had not come between us .
aside so would i , till you had measured how long a fool you were upon the ground .
and that she should love this fellow and refuse me !
aside if it be a sin to make a true election , she is damned .
sir , as i told you always , her beauty and her brain go not together she a good sign , but i have seen small reflection of her wit .
aside she shines not upon fools , lest the reflection should hurt her .
come , i to my chamber .
would there had been some hurt done !
aside i wish not so , unless it had been the fall of an ass , which is no great hurt .
you go with us ?

nay , come , let go together .

enter imogen and pisanio i would thou unto the shores o ' the haven , and every sail if he should write and not have it , a paper lost , as offer mercy is .
what was the last that he spake to thee ?
it was his queen , his queen !
then waved his handkerchief ?
and kiss it , madam .
senseless linen !
happier therein than i !
and that was all ?
no , madam , for so long as he could make me with this eye or ear distinguish him from others , he did keep the deck , with glove , or hat , or handkerchief , still waving , as the fits and stirs of mind could best express how slow his soul sail on , how swift his ship .
thou shouldst have made him as little as a crow , or less , ere left to him .
madam , so i did .
i would have broke mine , crack them , but to look upon him , till the diminution of space had pointed him sharp as my needle , nay , follow him , till he had melted from the smallness of a gnat to air , and then have turn mine eye and wept .
but , good pisanio , when shall we hear from him ?
be assured , madam , with his next vantage .
i did not take my leave of him , but had most pretty things to say ere i could tell him how i would think on him at certain hours such thoughts and such , or i could make him swear the shes of italy should not betray mine interest and his honour , or have charged him , at the sixth hour of morn , at noon , at midnight , to encounter me with orisons , for then i am in heaven for him , or ere i could give him that parting kiss which i had set betwixt two charming words , comes in my father and like the tyrannous breathing of the north shakes all our buds from growing .

those things i bid you do , get them dispatch .
i will attend the queen .
madam , i shall .
exeunt scene iv .
rome .
philario house .
enter philario , iachimo , a frenchman , a dutchman , and a spaniard believe it , sir , i have seen him in britain he was then of a crescent note , expected to prove so worthy as since he hath been allowed the name of , but i could then have looked on him without the help of admiration , though the catalogue of his endowments had been tabled by his side and i to peruse him by items .
you speak of him when he was less furnished than now he is with that which makes him both without and within .
i have seen him in france we had very many there could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he .
this matter of marrying his king daughter , wherein he must be weighed rather by her value than his own , words him , i doubt not , a great deal from the matter .
and then his banishment .
ay , and the approbation of those that weep this lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully to extend him , be it but to fortify her judgment , which else an easy battery might lay flat , for taking a beggar without less quality .
but how comes it he is to sojourn with you ?
how creeps acquaintance ?
his father and i were soldiers together , to whom i have been often bound for no less than my life .
here comes the briton let him be so entertained amongst you as suits , with gentlemen of your knowing , to a stranger of his quality .
enter posthumus leonatus i beseech you all , be better known to this gentleman , whom i commend to you as a noble friend of mine how worthy he is i will leave to appear hereafter , rather than story him in his own hearing .
sir , we have known together in orleans .
since when i have been debtor to you for courtesies , which i will be ever to pay and yet pay still .
sir , you my poor kindness i was glad i did atone my countryman and you , it had been pity you should have been put together with so mortal a purpose as then each bore , upon importance of so slight and trivial a nature .
by your pardon , sir , i was then a young traveller , rather shunned to go even with what i heard than in my every action to be guided by others ' experiences but upon my mended judgment if i offend not to say it is mended my quarrel was not altogether slight .
, yes , to be put to the arbitrement of swords , and by such two that would by all likelihood have confounded one the other , or have fallen both .
can we , with manners , ask what was the difference ?
safely , i think was a contention in public , which may , without contradiction , suffer the report .
it was much like an argument that fell out last night , where each of us fell in praise of our country mistresses , this gentleman at that time vouching and upon warrant of bloody affirmation his to be more fair , virtuous , wise , chaste , and less attemptable than any the rarest of our ladies in france .
that lady is not now living , or this gentleman opinion by this worn out .
she holds her virtue still and i my mind .
you must not so far prefer her ours of italy .
being so far provoked as i was in france , i would abate her nothing , though i profess myself her adorer , not her friend .
as fair and as good a kind of comparison had been something too fair and too good for any lady in britain .
if she went before others i have seen , as that diamond of yours outlustres many i have beheld .
i could not but believe she excelled many but i have not seen the most precious diamond that is , nor you the lady .
i praised her as i rated her so do i my stone .
what do you esteem it at ?
more than the world enjoys .
either your unparagoned mistress is dead , or she outprized by a trifle .
you are mistaken the one may be sold , or given , if there were wealth enough for the purchase , or merit for the gift the other is not a thing for sale , and only the gift of the gods .
which the gods have given you ?
which , by their graces , i will keep .
you may wear her in title yours but , you know , strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds .
your ring may be stolen too so your brace of unprizable estimations , the one is but frail and the other casual , a cunning thief , or a that way accomplished courtier , would hazard the winning both of first and last .
your italy contains none so accomplished a courtier to convince the honour of my mistress , if , in the holding or loss of that , you term her frail .
i do nothing doubt you have store of thieves , notwithstanding , i fear not my ring .
let us leave here , gentlemen .
sir , with all my heart .
this worthy signior , i thank him , makes no stranger of me , we are familiar at first .
with five times so much conversation , i should get ground of your fair mistress , make her go back , even to the yielding , had i admittance and opportunity to friend .
no , no .
i dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to your ring , which , in my opinion , it something but i make my wager rather against your confidence than her reputation and , to bar your offence herein too , i durst attempt it against any lady in the world .
you are a great deal abused in too bold a persuasion , and i doubt not you sustain what you worthy of by your attempt .
what that ?
a repulse though your attempt , as you call it , deserve more , a punishment too .
gentlemen , enough of this it came in too suddenly , let it die as it was born , and , i pray you , be better acquainted .
would i had put my estate and my neighbour on the approbation of what i have spoke !
what lady would you choose to assail ?
yours , whom in constancy you think stands so safe .
i will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring , that , commend me to the court where your lady is , with no more advantage than the opportunity of a second conference , and i will bring from thence that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved .
i will wage against your gold , gold to it my ring i hold dear as my finger , is part of it .
you are afraid , and therein the wiser .
if you buy ladies ' flesh at a million a dram , you can not preserve it from tainting but i see you have some religion in you , that you fear .
this is but a custom in your tongue , you bear a graver purpose , i hope .
i am the master of my speeches , and would undergo what spoken , i swear .
will you ?
i shall but lend my diamond till your return let there be covenants drawn between my mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your unworthy thinking i dare you to this match here my ring .
i will have it no lay .
by the gods , it is one .
if i bring you no sufficient testimony that i have enjoyed the dearest bodily part of your mistress , my ten thousand ducats are yours , so is your diamond too if i come off , and leave her in such honour as you have trust in , she your jewel , this your jewel , and my gold are yours provided i have your commendation for my more free entertainment .
i embrace these conditions , let us have articles betwixt us .
only , thus far you shall answer if you make your voyage upon her and give me directly to understand you have prevailed , i am no further your enemy , she is not worth our debate if she remain unseduced , you not making it appear otherwise , for your ill opinion and the assault you have made to her chastity you shall answer me with your sword .
your hand , a covenant we will have these things set down by lawful counsel , and straight away for britain , lest the bargain should catch cold and starve i will fetch my gold and have our two wagers recorded .
agreed .
exeunt posthumus leonatus and iachimo will this hold , think you ?
signior iachimo will not from it .
pray , let us follow .
exeunt scene britain .
a room in cymbeline palace .
enter queen , ladies , and cornelius whiles yet the dew on ground , gather those flowers , make haste who has the note of them ?
i , madam .
dispatch .
exeunt ladies now , master doctor , have you brought those drugs ?
pleaseth your highness , ay here they are , madam presenting a small box but i beseech your grace , without offence , my conscience bids me ask wherefore you have commanded of me those most poisonous compounds , which are the movers of a languishing death , but though slow , deadly ?
i wonder , doctor , thou me such a question .
have i not been thy pupil long ?
hast thou not learn me how to make perfumes ?
distil ?
preserve ?
yea , so that our great king himself doth woo me oft for my confections ?
having thus far proceeded , unless thou me devilish not meet that i did amplify my judgment in other conclusions ?
i will try the forces of these thy compounds on such creatures as we count not worth the hanging , but none human , to try the vigour of them and apply allayments to their act , and by them gather their several virtues and effects .
your highness shall from this practise but make hard your heart besides , the seeing these effects will be both noisome and infectious .
o , content thee .
enter pisanio aside here comes a flattering rascal , upon him will i first work he for his master , an enemy to my son .
how now , pisanio !
doctor , your service for this time is ended , take your own way .
aside i do suspect you , madam , but you shall do no harm .
to pisanio hark thee , a word .
aside i do not like her .
she doth think she has strange lingering poisons i do know her spirit , and will not trust one of her malice with a drug of such damn nature .
those she has will stupefy and dull the sense awhile , which first , perchance , she prove on cats and dogs , then afterward up higher but there is no danger in what show of death it makes , more than the the spirits a time , to be more fresh , reviving .
she is fool with a most false effect , and i the truer , so to be false with her .
no further service , doctor , until i send for thee .
i humbly take my leave .
exit weeps she still , thou ?
dost thou think in time she will not quench and let instructions enter where folly now possesses ?
do thou work when thou shalt bring me word she loves my son , i tell thee on the instant thou art then as great as is thy master , greater , for his fortunes all lie speechless and his name is at last gasp return he can not , nor continue where he is to shift his being is to exchange one misery with another , and every day that comes comes to decay a day work in him .
what shalt thou expect , to be depender on a thing that leans , who can not be new built , nor has no friends , so much as but to prop him ?
the queen drops the box pisanio takes it up thou takest up thou not what , but take it for thy labour it is a thing i made , which hath the king five times redeem from death i do not know what is more cordial .
nay , i prethee , take it , it is an earnest of a further good that i mean to thee .
tell thy mistress how the case stands with her , as from thyself .
think what a chance thou changest on , but think thou hast thy mistress still , to boot , my son , who shall take notice of thee i move the king to any shape of thy preferment such as desire , and then myself , i chiefly , that set thee on to this desert , am bound to load thy merit richly .
call my women think on my words .
exit pisanio a sly and constant knave , not to be shaked , the agent for his master and the remembrancer of her to hold the to her lord .
i have given him that which , if he take , shall quite unpeople her of liegers for her sweet , and which she after , except she bend her humour , shall be assured to taste of too .
pisanio and ladies so , so well done , well done the violets , cowslips , and the primroses , bear to my closet .
fare thee well , pisanio , think on my words .
exeunt queen and ladies and shall do but when to my good lord i prove untrue , i choke myself there all i do for you .
exit scene vi .
the same .
another room in the palace .
enter imogen a father cruel , and a false , a foolish suitor to a wedded lady , that hath her husband banish , o , that husband !
my supreme crown of grief !
and those repeated vexations of it !
had i been , as my two brothers , happy !
but most miserable is the desire that glorious blest be those , how mean , that have their honest wills , which seasons comfort .
who may this be ?
fie !
enter pisanio and iachimo madam , a noble gentleman of rome , comes from my lord with letters .
change you , madam ?
the worthy leonatus is in safety and greets your highness dearly .
presents a letter thanks , good sir you kindly welcome .
aside all of her that is out of door most rich !
if she be furnish with a mind so rare , she is alone the arabian bird , and i have lost the wager .
boldness be my friend !
arm me , audacity , from head to foot !
or , like the parthian , i shall flying fight , rather directly fly .
reads is one of the noblest note , to whose kindnesses i am most infinitely tied .
reflect upon him accordingly , as you value your trust leonatus . '
so far i read aloud but even the very middle of my heart is warm by the rest , and takes it thankfully .
you are as welcome , worthy sir , as i have words to bid you , and shall find it so in all that i can do .
thanks , fairest lady .
what , are men mad ?
hath nature given them eyes to see this vaulted arch , and the rich crop of sea and land , which can distinguish the fiery orbs above and the twinn stones upon the number beach ?
and can we not partition make with spectacles so precious fair and foul ?
what makes your admiration ?
it can not be i ' the eye , for apes and monkeys two such shes would chatter this way and contemn with mows the other , nor i ' the judgment , for idiots in this case of favour would be wisely definite , nor i ' the appetite , sluttery to such neat excellence opposed should make desire vomit emptiness , not so allured to feed .
what is the matter , trow ?
the cloyed will , that satiate yet unsatisfied desire , that tub both fill and running , ravening first the lamb longs after for the garbage .
what , dear sir , thus raps you ?
are you well ?
thanks , madam , well .
to pisanio beseech you , sir , desire my man abode where i did leave him he is strange and peevish .
i was going , sir , to give him welcome .
exit continues well my lord ?
his health , beseech you ?
well , madam .
is he disposed to mirth ?
i hope he is .
exceeding pleasant , none a stranger there so merry and so gamesome he is call the briton reveller .
when he was here , he did incline to sadness , and not knowing why .
i never saw him sad .
there is a frenchman his companion , one an eminent monsieur , that , it seems , much loves a gallian girl at home , he furnaces the thick sighs from him , whiles the jolly briton your lord , i mean laughs from free lungs , cries ' o , can my sides hold , to think that man , who knows by history , report , or his own proof , what woman is , yea , what she can not choose but must be , will his free hours languish for assured bondage ? '
will my lord say so ?
ay , madam , with his eyes in flood with laughter it is a recreation to be by and hear him mock the frenchman .
but , heavens know , some men are much to blame .
not he , i hope .
not he but yet heaven bounty towards him might be used more thankfully .
in himself , is much , in you , which i account his beyond all talents , whilst i am bound to wonder , i am bound to pity too .
what do you pity , sir ?
two creatures heartily .
am i one , sir ?
you look on me what wreck discern you in me deserves your pity ?
lamentable !
what , to hide me from the radiant sun and solace i ' the dungeon by a snuff ?
i pray you , sir , deliver with more openness your answers to my demands .
why do you pity me ?
that others do i was about to say enjoy your but it is an office of the gods to venge it , not mine to speak on .
you do seem to know something of me , or what concerns me pray you , since doubling things go ill often hurts more than to be sure they do , for certainties either are past remedies , or , timely knowing , the remedy then born discover to me what both you spur and stop .
had i this cheek to bathe my lips upon , this hand , whose touch , whose every touch , would force the feeler soul to the oath of loyalty , this object , which takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye , fixing it only here , should i , damn then , slaver with lips as common as the stairs that mount the capitol , join gripes with hands made hard with hourly falsehood falsehood , as with labour , then in an eye base and unlustrous as the smoky light that fed with stinking tallow , it were fit that all the plagues of hell should at one time encounter such revolt .
my lord , i fear , has forgot britain .
and himself .
not i , inclined to this intelligence , pronounce the beggary of his change , but is your graces that from pay mutest conscience to my tongue charms this report out .
let me hear no more .
o dearest soul !
your cause doth strike my heart with pity , that doth make me sick .
a lady so fair , and fasten to an empery , would make the king double , to be partner with tomboys hired with that which your own coffers yield !
with diseased ventures that play with all infirmities for gold which rottenness can lend nature !
such boil stuff as well might poison poison !
be revenged , or she that bore you was no queen , and you recoil from your great stock .
revenged !
how should i be revenged ?
if this be true , as i have such a heart that both mine ears must not in haste abuse if it be true , how should i be revenged ?
should he make me live , like diana priest , betwixt cold sheets , whiles he is vaulting variable ramps , in your despite , upon your purse ?
revenge it .
i dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure , more noble than that runagate to your bed , and will continue fast to your affection , still close as sure .
what , ho , pisanio !
let me my service tender on your lips .
away !
i do condemn mine ears that have so long attended thee .
if thou wert honourable , thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue , not for such an end thou , as base as strange .
thou a gentleman , who is as far from thy report as thou from honour , and here a lady that disdains thee and the devil alike .
what ho , pisanio !
the king my father shall be made acquainted of thy assault if he shall think it fit , a saucy stranger in his court to mart as in a romish stew and to expound his beastly mind to us , he hath a court he little cares for and a daughter who he not respects at all .
what , ho , pisanio !
o happy leonatus !
i may say the credit that thy lady hath of thee deserves thy trust , and thy most perfect goodness her assured credit .
blessed live you long !
a lady to the worthiest sir that ever country call his !
and you his mistress , only for the most worthiest fit !
give me your pardon .
i have spoke this , to know if your affiance were deeply rooted , and shall make your lord , that which he is , new and he is one the truest manner , such a holy witch that he enchants societies into him , half all men hearts are his .
you make amends .
he sits men like a descended god he hath a kind of honour sets him off , more than a mortal seeming .
be not angry , most mighty princess , that i have adventured to try your taking a false report , which hath honour with confirmation your great judgment in the election of a sir so rare , which you know can not err the love i bear him made me to fan you thus , but the gods made you , unlike all others , chaffless .
pray , your pardon .
all well , sir take my power i ' the court for yours .
my humble thanks .
i had almost forgot to entreat your grace but in a small request , and yet of moment to , for it concerns your lord , myself and other noble friends , are partners in the business .
pray , what ?
some dozen romans of us and your lord the best feather of our wing have mingled sums to buy a present for the emperor which i , the factor for the rest , have done in france is plate of rare device , and jewels of rich and exquisite form , their values great , and i am something curious , being strange , to have them in safe stowage may it please you to take them in protection ?
willingly , and pawn mine honour for their safety since my lord hath interest in them , i will keep them in my bedchamber .
they are in a trunk , attended by my men i will make bold to send them to you , only for this night , i must aboard .
o , no , no .
yes , i beseech , or i shall short my word by lengthening my return .
from gallia i cross the seas on purpose and on promise to see your grace .
i thank you for your pains but not away !
o , i must , madam therefore i shall beseech you , if you please to greet your lord with writing , i have outstood my time , which is material to the tender of our present .
i will write .

what got he by that ?
you have broke his pate with your bowl .

is her breathing that perfumes the chamber thus the flame o ' the taper bows toward her , and would her lids , to see the enclosed lights , now canopied under these windows , white and azure laced with blue of heaven own tinct .
but my design , to note the chamber i will write all down such and such pictures , there the window , such the adornment of her bed , the arras , figures , why , such and such , and the contents o ' the story .
ah , but some natural notes about her body , above ten thousand meaner moveables would testify , to enrich mine inventory .
o sleep , thou ape of death , lie dull upon her !
and be her sense but as a monument , thus in a chapel lying !
come off , come off taking off her bracelet as slippery as the gordian knot was hard !
is mine , and this will witness outwardly , as strongly as the conscience does within , to the madding of her lord .
on her left breast a mole , like the crimson drops i ' the bottom of a cowslip here a voucher , stronger than ever law could make this secret will force him think i have pick the lock and the treasure of her honour .
no more .
to what end ?
why should i write this down , that riveted , screw to my memory ?
she hath been reading late the tale of tereus , here the leaf turn down where philomel gave up .

you sin against obedience , which you owe your father .
for the contract you pretend with that base wretch , one bred of alms and foster with cold dishes , with scraps o ' the court , it is no contract , none and though it be allow in meaner parties yet who than he more mean ? to knit their souls , on whom there is no more dependency but brats and beggary , in knot , yet you are curb from that enlargement by the consequence o ' the crown , and must not soil the precious note of it with a base slave .
a hilding for a livery , a squire cloth , a pantler , not so eminent .
profane fellow wert thou the son of jupiter and no more but what thou art besides , thou wert too base to be his groom thou wert dignified enough , even to the point of envy , if made comparative for your virtues , to be styled the of his kingdom , and hated for being preferred so well .

what means do you make to him ?
not any , but abide the change of time , quake in the present winter state and wish that warmer days would come in these sear hopes , i barely gratify your love , they failing , i must die much your debtor .
your very goodness and your company all i can do .
by this , your king hath heard of great augustus caius lucius will do commission throughly and i think he grant the tribute , send the arrearages , or look upon our romans , whose remembrance is yet fresh in their grief .
i do believe , statist though i am none , nor like to be , that this will prove a war , and you shall hear the legions now in gallia sooner landed in our britain than have tidings of any penny tribute paid .
our countrymen are men more order than when julius caesar smiled at their lack of skill , but found their courage worthy his frowning at their discipline , now mingled with their courages , will make known to their approvers they are people such that mend upon the world .

iachimo !
the swiftest harts have posted you by land , and winds of all the comers kiss your sails , to make your vessel nimble .
welcome , sir .
i hope the briefness of your answer made the speediness of your return .
your lady is one of the fairest that i have look upon .
and therewithal the best , or let her beauty look through a casement to allure false hearts and be false with them .
here are letters for you .
their tenor good , i trust .
is very like .
was caius lucius in the britain court when you were there ?
he was expected then , but not approach .
all is well yet .
sparkles this stone as it was wont ?
or not too dull for your good wearing ?
if i had lost it , i should have lost the worth of it in gold .
i make a journey twice as far , to enjoy a second night of such sweet shortness which was mine in britain , for the ring is won .
the stone too hard to come by .
not a whit , your lady being so easy .
make not , sir , your loss your sport i hope you know that we must not continue friends .
good sir , we must , if you keep covenant .
had i not brought the knowledge of your mistress home , i grant we were to question further but i now profess myself the winner of her honour , together with your ring , and not the wronger of her or you , having proceeded but by both your wills .
if you can apparent that you have tasted her in bed , my hand and ring is yours , if not , the foul opinion you had of her pure honour gains or loses your sword or mine , or masterless leaves both to who shall find them .
sir , my circumstances , being so near the truth as i will make them , must first induce you to believe whose strength i will confirm with oath , which , i doubt not , you give me leave to spare , when you shall find you need it not .

first , her bedchamber , where , i confess , i slept not , but profess had that was well worth watching it was hang with tapesty of silk and silver , the story proud cleopatra , when she met her roman , and cydnus swell above the banks , or for the press of boats or pride a piece of work so bravely done , so rich , that it did strive in workmanship and value , which i wonder could be so rarely and exactly wrought , since the true life o was this is true , and this you might have heard of here , by me , or by some other .
more particulars must justify my knowledge .
so they must , or do your honour injury .
the chimney is south the chamber , and the chaste dian bathing never saw i figures so likely to report themselves the cutter was as another nature , dumb , outwent her , motion and breath left out .
this is a thing which you might from relation likewise reap , being , as it is , much spoke of .
the roof o ' the chamber with golden cherubins is fretted her andirons i had forgot them were two winking cupids of silver , each on one foot standing , nicely depending on their brands .
this is her honour !
let it be granted you have seen all this and praise be given to your remembrance the description of what is in her chamber nothing saves the wager you have laid .

sir , be patient this is not strong enough to be believed of one persuaded well of never talk o , she hath been colted by him .
if you seek for further satisfying , under her breast worthy the pressing lies a mole , right proud of that most delicate lodging by my life , i kiss it , and it gave me present hunger to feed again , though full .
