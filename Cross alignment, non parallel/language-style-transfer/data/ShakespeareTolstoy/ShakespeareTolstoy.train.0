act i scene london .
the palace .
enter king henry , lord john of lancaster , the earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and others so shaken as we are , so wan with care , find we a time for frighted peace to pant , and breathe accents of new broils to be commenced in strands afar remote .
no more the thirsty entrance of this soil shall daub her lips with her own children blood , nor more shall trenching war channel her fields , nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs of hostile paces those opposed eyes , which , like the meteors of a troubled heaven , all of one nature , of one substance bred , did lately meet in the intestine shock and furious close of civil butchery shall now , in mutual ranks , march all one way and be no more opposed against acquaintance , kindred and allies the edge of war , like an knife , no more shall cut his master .
therefore , friends , as far as to the sepulchre of christ , whose soldier now , under whose blessed cross we are impressed and engaged to fight , forthwith a power of english shall we levy , whose arms were moulded in their mothers ' womb to chase these pagans in those holy fields over whose acres walk those blessed feet which fourteen hundred years ago were nail for our advantage on the bitter cross .
but this our purpose now is twelve month old , and bootless is to tell you we will go therefore we meet not now .
then let me hear of you , my gentle cousin westmoreland , what yesternight our council did decree in forwarding this dear expedience .
my liege , this haste was hot in question , and many limits of the charge set down but yesternight when all athwart there came a post from wales loaden with heavy news , whose worst was , that the noble mortimer , leading the men of herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild glendower , was by the rude hands of that welshman taken , a thousand of his people butchered , upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse , such beastly shameless transformation , by those welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of .
it seems then that the tidings of this broil brake off our business for the holy land .
this match with other did , my gracious lord , for more uneven and unwelcome news came from the north and thus it did import on day , the gallant hotspur there , young harry percy and brave archibald , that and approved scot , at holmedon met , where they did spend a sad and bloody hour , as by discharge of their artillery , and shape of likelihood , the news was told , for he that brought them , in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse , uncertain of the issue any way .
here is a dear , a true industrious friend , sir walter blunt , new lighted from his horse .
stain with the variation of each soil betwixt that holmedon and this seat of ours , and he hath brought us smooth and welcome news .
the earl of douglas is discomfited ten thousand bold scots , two and twenty knights , balk in their own blood did sir walter see on holmedon plains .
of prisoners , hotspur took mordake the earl of fife , and eldest son to beaten douglas , and the earl of athol , of murray , angus , and menteith and is not this an honourable spoil ?
a gallant prize ?
ha , cousin , is it not ?
in faith , it is a conquest for a prince to boast of .
yea , there thou makest me sad and makest me sin in envy that my lord northumberland should be the father to so blest a son , a son who is the theme of honour tongue , amongst a grove , the very straightest plant , who is sweet fortune minion and her pride whilst i , by looking on the praise of him , see riot and dishonour stain the brow of my young harry .
o that it could be proved that some fairy had exchanged in our children where they lay , and call mine percy , his plantagenet !
then would i have his harry , and he mine .
but let him from my thoughts .
what think you , coz , of this young percy pride ?
the prisoners , which he in this adventure hath surprised , to his own use he keeps , and sends me word , i shall have none but mordake earl of fife .
this is his uncle teaching , this is worcester , malevolent to you in all aspects , which makes him prune himself , and bristle up the crest of youth against your dignity .
but i have sent for him to answer this , and for this cause awhile we must neglect our holy purpose to jerusalem .
cousin , on wednesday next our council we will hold at windsor , so inform the lords but come yourself with speed to us again , for more is to be said and to be done than out of anger can be uttered .
i will , my liege .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
an apartment of the prince .
enter the prince of wales and falstaff now , hal , what time of day is it , lad ?
thou art so , with drinking of old sack and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon benches after noon , that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know .
what a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day ?
unless hours were cups of sack and minutes capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the signs of and the blessed sun himself a fair hot wench in taffeta , i see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day .
indeed , you come near me now , hal , for we that take purses go by the moon and the seven stars , and not by phoebus , he , wandering knight so fair . '
and , i prithee , sweet wag , when thou art king , as , god save thy grace , majesty i should say , for grace thou wilt have none , what , none ?
no , by my troth , not so much as will serve to prologue to an egg and butter .
well , how then ?
come , roundly , roundly .
marry , then , sweet wag , when thou art king , let not us that are squires of the night body be called thieves of the day beauty let us be diana foresters , gentlemen of the shade , minions of the moon , and let men say we be men of good government , being governed , as the sea is , by our noble and chaste mistress the moon , under whose countenance we steal .
thou sayest well , and it holds well too , for the fortune of us that are the moon men doth ebb and flow like the sea , being governed , as the sea is , by the moon .
as , for proof , now a purse of gold most resolutely snatched on monday night and most dissolutely spent on tuesday morning , got with swearing by ' and spent with crying in , ' now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows .
by the lord , thou sayest true , lad .
and is not my hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench ?
as the honey of hybla , my old lad of the castle .
and is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance ?
how now , how now , mad wag !
what , in thy quips and thy quiddities ?
what a plague have i to do with a buff jerkin ?
why , what a pox have i to do with my hostess of the tavern ?
well , thou hast called her to a reckoning many a time and oft .
did i ever call for thee to pay thy part ?
no , i give thee thy due , thou hast paid all there .
yea , and elsewhere , so far as my coin would stretch , and where it would not , i have used my credit .
yea , and so used it that were it not here apparent that thou art heir apparent but , i prithee , sweet wag , shall there be gallows standing in england when thou art king ?
and resolution thus fobbed as it is with the rusty curb of old father antic the law ?
do not thou , when thou art king , hang a thief .
no , thou shalt .
shall i ?
o rare !
by the lord , i be a brave judge .
thou judgest false already i mean , thou shalt have the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman .
well , hal , well , and in some sort it jumps with my humour as well as waiting in the court , i can tell you .
for obtaining of suits ?
yea , for obtaining of suits , whereof the hangman hath no lean wardrobe .
, i am as melancholy as a gib cat or a lugged bear .
or an old lion , or a lover lute .
yea , or the drone of a lincolnshire bagpipe .
what sayest thou to a hare , or the melancholy of ?
thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed the most comparative , rascalliest , sweet young prince .
but , hal , i prithee , trouble me no more with vanity .
i would to god thou and i knew where a commodity of good names were to be bought .
an old lord of the council rated me the other day in the street about you , sir , but i marked him not , and yet he talked very wisely , but i regarded him not , and yet he talked wisely , and in the street too .
thou didst well , for wisdom cries out in the streets , and no man regards it .
o , thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able to corrupt a saint .
thou hast done much harm upon me , hal , god forgive thee for it !
before i knew thee , hal , i knew nothing , and now am i , if a man should speak truly , little better than one of the wicked .
i must give over this life , and i will give it over by the lord , and i do not , i am a villain i be damned for never a king son in christendom .
where shall we take a purse tomorrow , jack ?
, where thou wilt , lad , i make one , an i do not , call me villain and baffle me .
i see a good amendment of life in thee , from praying to .
why , hal , is my vocation , hal , is no sin for a man to labour in his vocation .
enter poins poins !
now shall we know if gadshill have set a match .
o , if men were to be saved by merit , what hole in hell were hot enough for him ?
this is the most omnipotent villain that ever cried ' to a true man .
good morrow , ned .
good morrow , sweet hal .
what says monsieur remorse ?
what says sir john sack and sugar ?
jack !
how agrees the devil and thee about thy soul , that thou soldest him on last for a cup of madeira and a cold capon leg ?
sir john stands to his word , the devil shall have his bargain , for he was never yet a breaker of proverbs he will give the devil his due .
then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil .
else he had been damned for cozening the devil .
but , my lads , my lads , morning , by four , early at gadshill !
there are pilgrims going to canterbury with rich offerings , and traders riding to london with fat purses i have vizards for you all , you have horses for yourselves gadshill lies in rochester i have bespoke supper night in eastcheap we may do it as secure as sleep .
if you will go , i will stuff your purses full of crowns , if you will not , tarry at home and be hanged .
hear ye , yedward , if i tarry at home and go not , i hang you for going .
you will , chops ?
hal , wilt thou make one ?
who , i rob ?
i a thief ?
not i , by my faith .
there neither honesty , manhood , nor good fellowship in thee , nor thou camest not of the blood royal , if thou darest not stand for ten shillings .
well then , once in my days i be a madcap .
why , that well said .
well , come what will , i tarry at home .
by the lord , i be a traitor then , when thou art king .
i care not .
sir john , i prithee , leave the prince and me alone i will lay him down such reasons for this adventure that he shall go .
well , god give thee the spirit of persuasion and him the ears of profiting , that what thou speakest may move and what he hears may be believed , that the true prince may , for recreation sake , prove a false thief , for the poor abuses of the time want countenance .
farewell you shall find me in eastcheap .
farewell , thou latter spring !
farewell , summer !
exit falstaff now , my good sweet honey lord , ride with us i have a jest to execute that i can not manage alone .
falstaff , bardolph , peto and gadshill shall rob those men that we have already waylaid yourself and i will not be there , and when they have the booty , if you and i do not rob them , cut this head off from my shoulders .
how shall we part with them in setting forth ?
why , we will set forth before or after them , and appoint them a place of meeting , wherein it is at our pleasure to fail , and then will they adventure upon the exploit themselves , which they shall have no sooner achieved , but we set upon them .
yea , but is like that they will know us by our horses , by our habits and by every other appointment , to be ourselves .
tut !
our horses they shall not see i tie them in the wood , our vizards we will change after we leave them and , sirrah , i have cases of buckram for the nonce , to immask our noted outward garments .
yea , but i doubt they will be too hard for us .
well , for two of them , i know them to be as cowards as ever turned back , and for the third , if he fight longer than he sees reason , i forswear arms .
the virtue of this jest will be , the incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will tell us when we meet at supper how thirty , at least , he fought with , what wards , what blows , what extremities he endured , and in the reproof of this lies the jest .
well , i go with thee provide us all things necessary and meet me night in eastcheap , there i sup .
farewell .
farewell , my lord .
exit poins i know you all , and will awhile uphold the unyoked humour of your idleness yet herein will i imitate the sun , who doth permit the base contagious clouds to smother up his beauty from the world , that , when he please again to be himself , being wanted , he may be more wonder at , by breaking through the foul and ugly mists of vapours that did seem to strangle him .
if all the year were playing holidays , to sport would be as tedious as to work , but when they seldom come , they wish for come , and nothing pleaseth but rare accidents .
so , when this loose behavior i throw off and pay the debt i never promised , by how much better than my word i am , by so much shall i falsify men hopes , and like bright metal on a sullen ground , my reformation , glittering my fault , shall show more goodly and attract more eyes than that which hath no foil to set it off .
i so offend , to make offence a skill , redeeming time when men think least i will .
exit scene iii .
london .
the palace .
enter the king , northumberland , worcester , hotspur , sir walter blunt , with others my blood hath been too cold and temperate , unapt to stir at these indignities , and you have found me , for accordingly you tread upon my patience but be sure i will from henceforth rather be myself , mighty and to be fear , than my condition , which hath been smooth as oil , soft as young down , and therefore lost that title of respect which the proud soul pays but to the proud .
our house , my sovereign liege , little deserves the scourge of greatness to be used on it , and that same greatness too which our own hands have holp to make so portly .
my worcester , get thee gone , for i do see danger and disobedience in thine eye o , sir , your presence is too bold and peremptory , and majesty might never yet endure the moody frontier of a servant brow .
you have good leave to leave us when we need your use and counsel , we shall send for you .
exit worcester you were about to speak .
to north yea , my good lord .
those prisoners in your highness ' name demanded , which harry percy here at holmedon took , were , as he says , not with such strength denied as is deliver to your majesty either envy , therefore , or misprison is guilty of this fault and not my son .
my liege , i did deny no prisoners .
but i remember , when the fight was done , when i was dry with rage and extreme toil , breathless and faint , leaning upon my sword , came there a certain lord , neat , and trimly dress , fresh as a bridegroom , and his chin new reap show like a at , he was perfumed like a milliner , and his finger and his thumb he held a , which ever and anon he gave his nose and away again , who therewith angry , when it next came there , took it in snuff , and still he smiled and talk , and as the soldiers bore dead bodies by , he call them untaught knaves , unmannerly , to bring a slovenly unhandsome corse betwixt the wind and his nobility .
with many holiday and lady terms he question me , amongst the rest , demanded my prisoners in your majesty behalf .
i then , all smarting with my wounds being cold , to be so pester with a popinjay , out of my grief and my impatience , answer neglectingly i know not what , he should or he should not , for he made me mad to see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet and talk so like a of guns and drums and wounds , god save the mark ! and telling me the thing on earth was parmaceti for an inward bruise , and that it was great pity , so it was , this villanous should be digg out of the bowels of the harmless earth , which many a good tall fellow had destroy so cowardly , and but for these vile guns , he would himself have been a soldier .
this bald unjointed chat of his , my lord , i answer indirectly , as i said , and i beseech you , let not his report come current for an accusation betwixt my love and your high majesty .
the circumstance consider , good my lord , lord harry percy then had said to such a person and in such a place , at such a time , with all the rest retold , may reasonably die and never rise to do him wrong or any way impeach what then he said , so he unsay it now .
why , yet he doth deny his prisoners , but with proviso and exception , that we at our own charge shall ransom straight his , the foolish mortimer , who , on my soul , hath wilfully betray the lives of those that he did lead to fight against that great magician , damn glendower , whose daughter , as we hear , the earl of march hath lately married .
shall our coffers , then , be emptied to redeem a traitor home ?
shall we but treason ?
and indent with fears , when they have lost and forfeited themselves ?
no , on the barren mountains let him starve , for i shall never hold that man my friend whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost to ransom home revolted mortimer .
revolted mortimer !
he never did fall off , my sovereign liege , but by the chance of war , to prove that true needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds , those mouthed wounds , which valiantly he took when on the gentle severn sedgy bank , in single opposition , hand to hand , he did confound the best part of an hour in changing hardiment with great glendower three times they breathed and three times did they drink , upon agreement , of swift severn flood , who then , affrighted with their bloody looks , ran fearfully among the trembling reeds , and hid his crisp head in the hollow bank , bloodstained with these valiant combatants .
never did base and rotten policy colour her working with such deadly wounds , nor could the noble mortimer receive so many , and all willingly then let not him be slander with revolt .
thou dost belie him , percy , thou dost belie him , he never did encounter with glendower i tell thee , he durst as well have met the devil alone as owen glendower for an enemy .
art thou not ashamed ?
but , sirrah , henceforth let me not hear you speak of mortimer send me your prisoners with the speediest means , or you shall hear in such a kind from me as will displease you .
my lord northumberland , we licence your departure with your son .
send us your prisoners , or you will hear of it .
exeunt king henry , blunt , and train an if the devil come and roar for them , i will not send them i will after straight and tell him so , for i will ease my heart , albeit i make a hazard of my head .
what , drunk with choler ?
stay and pause awhile here comes your uncle .
worcester speak of mortimer !
, i will speak of him , and let my soul want mercy , if i do not join with him yea , on his part i empty all these veins , and shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust , but i will lift the mortimer as high in the air as this unthankful king , as this ingrate and canker bolingbroke .
brother , the king hath made your nephew mad .
who struck this heat up after i was gone ?
he will , forsooth , have all my prisoners , and when i urged the ransom once again of my wife brother , then his cheek look pale , and on my face he turn an eye of death , trembling even at the name of mortimer .
i can not blame him was not he proclaim by richard that dead is the next of blood ?
he was , i heard the proclamation and then it was when the unhappy king , whose wrongs in us god pardon ! did set forth upon his irish expedition , from whence he intercepted did return to be deposed and shortly murdered .
and for whose death we in the world wide mouth live scandalized and foully spoken of .
but soft , i pray you , did king richard then proclaim my brother edmund mortimer heir to the crown ?
he did , myself did hear it .
nay , then i can not blame his cousin king , that wished him on the barren mountains starve .
but shall it be that you , that set the crown upon the head of this forgetful man and for his sake wear the detested blot of murderous subornation , shall it be , that you a world of curses undergo , being the agents , or base second means , the cords , the ladder , or the hangman rather ?
o , pardon me that i descend so low , to show the line and the predicament wherein you range under this subtle king , shall it for shame be spoken in these days , or fill up chronicles in time to come , that men of your nobility and power did gage them both in an unjust behalf , as both of you god pardon it ! have done , to put down richard , that sweet lovely rose , an plant this thorn , this canker , bolingbroke ?
and shall it in more shame be further spoken , that you are fool , discarded and shook off by him for whom these shames ye underwent ?
no , yet time serves wherein you may redeem your banish honours and restore yourselves into the good thoughts of the world again , revenge the jeering and disdain contempt of this proud king , who studies day and night to answer all the debt he owes to you even with the bloody payment of your deaths therefore , i say peace , cousin , say no more and now i will unclasp a secret book , and to your discontents i read you matter deep and dangerous , as full of peril and adventurous spirit as to a current roaring loud on the unsteadfast footing of a spear .
if he fall in , good night !
or sink or swim send danger from the east unto the west , so honour cross it from the north to south , and let them grapple o , the blood more stirs to rouse a lion than to start a hare !
imagination of some great exploit drives him beyond the bounds of patience .
by heaven , methinks it were an easy leap , to pluck bright honour from the moon , or dive into the bottom of the deep , where could never touch the ground , and pluck up drowned honour by the locks , so he that doth redeem her thence might wear without corrival , all her dignities but out upon this fellowship !
he apprehends a world of figures here , but not the form of what he should attend .
good cousin , give me audience for a while .
i cry you mercy .
those same noble scots that are your prisoners , i keep them all , by god , he shall not have a scot of them , no , if a scot would save his soul , he shall not i keep them , by this hand .
you start away and lend no ear unto my purposes .
those prisoners you shall keep .
nay , i will , that flat he said he would not ransom mortimer , forbad my tongue to speak of mortimer , but i will find him when he lies asleep , and in his ear i holla ! '
nay , i have a starling shall be taught to speak nothing but , ' and give it him to keep his anger still in motion .
hear you , cousin , a word .
all studies here i solemnly defy , save how to gall and pinch this bolingbroke and that same prince of wales , but that i think his father loves him not and would be glad he met with some mischance , i would have him poison with a pot of ale .
farewell , kinsman i talk to you when you are better temper to attend .
why , what a and impatient fool art thou to break into this woman mood , tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own !
why , look you , i am whipp and scourged with rods , nettled and stung with pismires , when i hear of this vile politician , bolingbroke .
in richard time , what do you call the place ? a plague upon it , it is in gloucestershire , was where the madcap duke his uncle kept , his uncle york , where i first bow my knee unto this king of smiles , this bolingbroke , ! when you and he came back from ravenspurgh .
at berkley castle .
you say true why , what a candy deal of courtesy this fawning greyhound then did proffer me !
look , his infant fortune came to age , ' and harry percy , ' and cousin , ' o , the devil take such cozeners !
god forgive me !
good uncle , tell your tale , i have done .
nay , if you have not , to it again , we will stay your leisure .
i have done , i ' faith .
then once more to your scottish prisoners .
deliver them up without their ransom straight , and make the douglas ' son your only mean for powers in scotland , which , for divers reasons which i shall send you written , be assured , will easily be granted .
you , my lord , to northumberland your son in scotland being thus employ , shall secretly into the bosom creep of that same noble prelate , well beloved , the archbishop .
of york , is it not ?
true , who bears hard his brother death at bristol , the lord scroop .
i speak not this in estimation , as what i think might be , but what i know is ruminated , plotted and set down , and only stays but to behold the face of that occasion that shall bring it on .
i smell it upon my life , it will do well .
before the game is afoot , thou still slip .
why , it can not choose but be a noble plot , and then the power of scotland and of york , to join with mortimer , ha ?
and so they shall .
in faith , it is exceedingly well aim .
and is no little reason bids us speed , to save our heads by raising of a head , for , bear ourselves as even as we can , the king will always think him in our debt , and think we think ourselves unsatisfied , till he hath found a time to pay us home and see already how he doth begin to make us strangers to his looks of love .
he does , he does we be revenged on him .
cousin , farewell no further go in this than i by letters shall direct your course .
when time is ripe , which will be suddenly , i steal to glendower and lord mortimer , where you and douglas and our powers at once , as i will fashion it , shall happily meet , to bear our fortunes in our own strong arms , which now we hold at much uncertainty .
farewell , good brother we shall thrive , i trust .
uncle , adieu o , let the hours be short till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport !

come , neighbour mugs , we call up the gentleman they will along with company , for they have great charge .
exeunt carriers what , ho !
chamberlain !
within at hand , quoth .
that even as fair as at hand , quoth the chamberlain , for thou variest no more from picking of purses than giving direction doth from labouring , thou layest the plot how .
enter chamberlain good morrow , master gadshill .
it holds current that i told you yesternight there a franklin in the wild of kent hath brought three hundred marks with him in gold i heard him tell it to one of his company last night at supper , a kind of auditor , one that hath abundance of charge too , god knows what .
they are up already , and call for eggs and butter , they will away presently .
sirrah , if they meet not with saint nicholas ' clerks , i give thee this neck .
no , i none of it i pray thee keep that for the hangman , for i know thou worshippest nicholas as truly as a man of falsehood may .
what talkest thou to me of the hangman ?
if i hang , i make a fat pair of gallows , for if i hang , old sir john hangs with me , and thou knowest he is no starveling .
tut !
there are other trojans that thou dreamest not of , the which for sport sake are content to do the profession some grace , that would , if matters should be looked into , for their own credit sake , make all whole .
i am joined with no rakers , no sixpenny strikers , none of these mad mustachio , but with nobility and tranquillity , burgomasters and great oneyers , such as can hold in , such as will strike sooner than speak , and speak sooner than drink , and drink sooner than pray and yet , zounds , i lie , for they pray continually to their saint , the commonwealth , or rather , not pray to her , but prey on her , for they ride up and down on her and make her their boots .

she will , she will , justice hath liquored her .

exeunt scene iii .
warkworth castle enter hotspur , solus , reading a letter for mine own part , my lord , i could be well contented to be there , in respect of the love i bear your house . '
he could be contented why is he not , then ?
in respect of the love he bears our house he shows in this , he loves his own barn better than he loves our house .
let me see some more .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , ' why , that certain is dangerous to take a cold , to sleep , to drink , but i tell you , my lord fool , out of this nettle , danger , we pluck this flower , safety .
purpose you undertake is dangerous , the friends you have named uncertain , the time itself unsorted , and your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so great an opposition . '
say you so , say you so ?
i say unto you again , you are a shallow cowardly hind , and you lie .
what a is this !
by the lord , our plot is a good plot as ever was laid , our friends true and constant a good plot , good friends , and full of expectation , an excellent plot , very good friends .
what a rogue is this !
why , my lord of york commends the plot and the general course of action .
, an i were now by this rascal , i could brain him with his lady fan .
is there not my father , my uncle and myself ?
lord edmund mortimer , my lord of york and owen glendower ?
is there not besides the douglas ?

i must leave you within these two hours .
o , my good lord , why are you thus alone ?
for what offence have i this fortnight been a banish woman from my harry bed ?
tell me , sweet lord , what that takes from thee thy stomach , pleasure and thy golden sleep ?
why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth , and start so often when thou alone ?
why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks , and given my treasures and my rights of thee to musing and cursed melancholy ?
in thy faint slumbers i by thee have watch , and heard thee murmur tales of iron wars , speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed , cry !
to the field ! '
and thou hast talk of sallies and retires , of trenches , tents , of palisadoes , frontiers , parapets , of basilisks , of cannon , culverin , of prisoners ' ransom and of soldiers slain , and all the currents of a heady fight .
thy spirit within thee hath been so at war and thus hath so bestirr thee in thy sleep , that beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow like bubbles in a stream , and in thy face strange motions have appear , such as we see when men restrain their breath on some great sudden hest .
o , what portents are these ?
some heavy business hath my lord in hand , and i must know it , else he loves me not .
what , ho !
enter servant is gilliams with the packet gone ?

i fear my brother mortimer doth stir about his title , and hath sent for you to line his enterprise but if you go , so far afoot , i shall be weary , love .
come , come , you paraquito , answer me directly unto this question that i ask in faith , i break thy little finger , harry , an if thou wilt not tell me all things true .
away , away , you trifler !
love !
i love thee not , i care not for thee , kate this is no world to play with mammets and to tilt with lips we must have bloody noses and crack crowns , and pass them current too .
god me , my horse !
what thou , kate ?
what thou have with me ?
do you not love me ?
do you not , indeed ?
well , do not then , for since you love me not , i will not love myself .
do you not love me ?
nay , tell me if you speak in jest or no .
come , wilt thou see me ride ?
and when i am on horseback , i will swear i love thee infinitely .
but hark you , kate , i must not have you henceforth question me whither i go , nor reason whereabout whither i must , i must , and , to conclude , this evening must i leave you , gentle kate .
i know you wise , but yet no farther wise than harry percy wife constant you are , but yet a woman and for secrecy , no lady closer , for i well believe thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know , and so far will i trust thee , gentle kate .
how !
so far ?
not an inch further .
but hark you , kate whither i go , thither shall you go too , will i set forth , you .
will this content you , kate ?
it must of force .

the tavern , eastcheap .
enter prince henry and poins ned , prithee , come out of that fat room , and lend me thy hand to laugh a little .

with three or four loggerheads amongst three or four score hogsheads .
i have sounded the very of humility .
sirrah , i am sworn brother to a leash of drawers , and can call them all by their christen names , as tom , dick , and francis .
they take it already upon their salvation , that though i be but the prince of wales , yet i am king of courtesy , and tell me flatly i am no proud jack , like falstaff , but a corinthian , a lad of mettle , a good boy , by the lord , so they call me , and when i am king of england , i shall command all the good lads in eastcheap .
they call drinking deep , dyeing scarlet , and when you breathe in your watering , they cry ! '
and bid you play it off .
to conclude , i am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour , that i can drink with any tinker in his own language during my life .
i tell thee , ned , thou hast lost much honour , that thou wert not with me in this sweet action .
but , sweet ned , to sweeten which name of ned , i give thee this pennyworth of sugar , clapped even now into my hand by an , one that never spake other english in his life than shillings and sixpence ' and are welcome , ' with this shrill addition , , anon , sir !

but , ned , to drive away the time till falstaff come , i prithee , do thou stand in some , while i question my puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar , and do thou never leave calling , ' that his tale to me may be nothing but . '

i am now of all humours that have showed themselves humours since the old days of goodman adam to the pupil age of this present twelve at midnight .
francis what , francis ?
anon , anon , sir .
exit that ever this fellow should have fewer words than a parrot , and yet the son of a woman !
his industry is upstairs and downstairs , his eloquence the parcel of a reckoning .
i am not yet of percy mind , the hotspur of the north , he that kills me some six or seven dozen of scots at a breakfast , washes his hands , and says to his wife upon this quiet life !
i want work . '
' o my sweet harry , ' says she , many hast thou killed ? '
my roan horse a drench , ' says he , and answers fourteen , ' an hour after , ' a trifle , a trifle . '

titan , that melted at the sweet tale of the sun !
if thou didst , then behold that compound .
you rogue , here lime in this sack too there is nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it .
a villanous coward !
go thy ways , old jack , die when thou wilt , if manhood , good manhood , be not forgot upon the face of the earth , then am i a shotten herring .
there live not three good men unhanged in england , and one of them is fat and grows old god help the while !
a bad world , i say .
i would i were a weaver , i could sing psalms or any thing .
a plague of all cowards , i say still .
how now , !
what mutter you ?
a king son !
if i do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger of lath , and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of , i never wear hair on my face more .

answer me to that and poins there ?

i call thee coward !
i see thee damned ere i call thee coward but i would give a thousand pound i could run as fast as thou canst .
you are straight enough in the shoulders , you care not who sees your back call you that backing of your friends ?
a plague upon such backing !
give me them that will face me .
give me a cup of sack i am a rogue , if i drunk .
o villain !
thy lips are scarce wiped since thou drunkest last .
all one for that .
he drinks a plague of all cowards , still say i .
what the matter ?
what the matter !
there be four of us here have a thousand pound this day morning .
where is it , jack ?
where is it ?
where is it !
taken from us it is a hundred upon poor four of us .
what , a hundred , man ?
i am a rogue , if i were not at with a dozen of them two hours together .
i have by miracle .
i am eight times thrust through the doublet , four through the hose , my buckler cut through and through , my sword hacked like a ecce signum !
i never dealt better since i was a man all would not do .
a plague of all cowards !
let them speak if they speak more or less than truth , they are villains and the sons of darkness .
speak , sirs , how was it ?
we four set upon some dozen sixteen at least , my lord .
and bound them .
no , no , they were not bound .
you rogue , they were bound , every man of them , or i am a jew else , an ebrew jew .
as we were sharing , some six or seven fresh men set upon us and unbound the rest , and then come in the other .
what , fought you with them all ?
all !
i know not what you call all , but if i fought not with fifty of them , i am a bunch of radish if there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old jack , then am i no creature .
pray god you have not murdered some of them .
nay , that past praying for i have peppered two of them , two i am sure i have paid , two rogues in buckram suits .
i tell thee what , hal , if i tell thee a lie , spit in my face , call me horse .
thou knowest my old ward , here i lay and thus i bore my point .
four rogues in buckram let drive at me what , four ?
thou saidst but two even now .
four , hal , i told thee four .
ay , ay , he said four .
these four came all , and mainly thrust at me .
i made me no more ado but took all their seven points in my target , thus .
seven ?
why , there were but four even now .
in buckram ?
ay , four , in buckram suits .
seven , by these hilts , or i am a villain else .
prithee , let him alone , we shall have more anon .
dost thou hear me , hal ?
ay , and mark thee too , jack .
do so , for it is worth the listening to .
these nine in buckram that i told thee of so , two more already .
their points being broken , down fell their hose .
began to give me ground but i followed me close , came in foot and hand , and with a thought seven of the eleven i paid .
o monstrous !
eleven buckram men grown out of two !
but , as the devil would have it , three misbegotten knaves in kendal green came at my back and let drive at me , for it was so dark , hal , that thou couldst not see thy hand .
these lies are like their father that begets them , gross as a mountain , open , palpable .
why , thou guts , thou fool , thou whoreson , obscene , grease , what , art thou mad ?
art thou mad ?
is not the truth the truth ?
why , how couldst thou know these men in kendal green , when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy hand ?
come , tell us your reason what sayest thou to this ?
come , your reason , jack , your reason .
what , upon compulsion ?
, an i were at the strappado , or all the racks in the world , i would not tell you on compulsion .
give you a reason on compulsion !
if reasons were as plentiful as blackberries , i would give no man a reason upon compulsion , i .
i be no longer guilty of this sin , this sanguine coward , this , this , this huge hill of flesh , , you starveling , you , you dried neat tongue , you bull pizzle , you !
o for breath to utter what is like thee !
you , you sheath , you bowcase , you vile , well , breathe awhile , and then to it again and when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons , hear me speak but this .
mark , jack .
we two saw you four set on four and bound them , and were masters of their wealth .
mark now , how a plain tale shall put you down .
then did we two set on you four , and , with a word , you from your prize , and have it , yea , and can show it you here in the house and , falstaff , you carried your guts away as nimbly , with as quick dexterity , and roared for mercy and still run and roared , as ever i heard .
what a slave art thou , to hack thy sword as thou hast done , and then say it was in fight !
what trick , what device , what , canst thou now find out to hide thee from this open and apparent shame ?
come , let hear , jack , what trick hast thou now ?
by the lord , i knew ye as well as he that made ye .
why , hear you , my masters was it for me to kill the ?
should i turn upon the true prince ?
why , thou knowest i am as valiant as hercules but beware instinct , the lion will not touch the true prince .
instinct is a great matter , i was now a coward on instinct .
i shall think the better of myself and thee during my life , i for a valiant lion , and thou for a true prince .
but , by the lord , lads , i am glad you have the money .
hostess , clap to the doors watch , pray .
gallants , lads , boys , hearts of gold , all the titles of good fellowship come to you !
what , shall we be merry ?
shall we have a play extempore ?
content , and the argument shall be thy running away .
ah , no more of that , hal , an thou lovest me !
enter hostess o jesu , my lord the prince !
how now , my lady the hostess !
what sayest thou to me ?
marry , my lord , there is a nobleman of the court at door would speak with you he says he comes from your father .
give him as much as will make him a royal man , and send him back again to my mother .
what manner of man is he ?
an old man .
what doth gravity out of his bed at midnight ?
shall i give him his answer ?
prithee , do , jack .
, and i send him packing .
exit falstaff now , sirs by ' r lady , you fought fair , so did you , peto , so did you , bardolph you are lions too , you ran away upon instinct , you will not touch the true prince , no , fie !
, i ran when i saw others run .
, tell me now in earnest , how came falstaff sword so hacked ?
why , he hacked it with his dagger , and said he would swear truth out of england but he would make you believe it was done in fight , and persuaded us to do the like .
yea , and to tickle our noses with to make them bleed , and then to beslubber our garments with it and swear it was the blood of true men .
i did that i did not this seven year before , i blushed to hear his monstrous devices .
o villain , thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years ago , and wert taken with the manner , and ever since thou hast blushed extempore .
thou hadst fire and sword on thy side , and yet thou rannest away what instinct hadst thou for it ?
my lord , do you see these meteors ?
do you behold these exhalations ?
i do .
what think you they portend ?
hot livers and cold purses .
choler , my lord , if rightly taken .
no , if rightly taken , halter .
falstaff here comes lean jack , here comes .
how now , my sweet creature of bombast !
how long ago , jack , since thou sawest thine own knee ?
my own knee !
when i was about thy years , hal , i was not an eagle talon in the waist , i could have crept into any alderman a plague of sighing and grief !
it blows a man up like a bladder .
there villanous news abroad here was sir john bracy from your father , you must to the court in the morning .
that same mad fellow of the north , percy , and he of wales , that gave amamon the bastinado and made lucifer cuckold and swore the devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a welsh hook what a plague call you him ?
o , glendower .
owen , owen , the same , and his mortimer , and old northumberland , and that sprightly scot of scots , douglas , that runs o ' horseback up a hill perpendicular , he that rides at high speed and with his pistol kills a sparrow flying .
you have hit it .
so did he never the sparrow .
well , that rascal hath good mettle in him , he will not run .
why , what a rascal art thou then , to praise him so for running !
o ' horseback , ye cuckoo , but afoot he will not budge a foot .
yes , jack , upon instinct .
i grant ye , upon instinct .
well , he is there too , and one mordake , and a thousand more worcester is stolen away , thy father beard is turned white with the news you may buy land now as cheap as stinking mackerel .
why , then , it is like , if there come a hot june and this civil buffeting hold , we shall buy maidenheads as they buy , by the hundreds .
by the mass , lad , thou sayest true , it is like we shall have good trading that way .
but tell me , hal , art not thou horrible afeard ?
thou being , could the world pick thee out three such enemies again as that fiend douglas , that spirit percy , and that devil glendower ?
art thou not horribly afraid ?
doth not thy blood thrill at it ?
not a whit , i ' faith , i lack some of thy instinct .
well , thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou comest to thy father if thou love me , practise an answer .
do thou stand for my father , and examine me upon the particulars of my life .
shall i ?
content this chair shall be my state , this dagger my sceptre , and this cushion my crown .
thy state is taken for a , thy golden sceptre for a leaden dagger , and thy precious rich crown for a pitiful bald crown !
well , an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee , now shalt thou be moved .
give me a cup of sack to make my eyes look red , that it may be thought i have wept , for i must speak in passion , and i will do it in king cambyses ' vein .
well , here is my leg .
and here is my speech .
stand aside , nobility .
o jesu , this is excellent sport , i ' faith !
weep not , sweet queen , for trickling tears are vain .
o , the father , how he holds his countenance !
for god sake , lords , convey my tristful queen , for tears do stop the of her eyes .
o jesu , he doth it as like one of these harlotry players as ever i see !
peace , good , peace , good .
harry , i do not only marvel where thou spendest thy time , but also how thou art accompanied for though the camomile , the more it is trodden on the faster it grows , yet youth , the more it is wasted the sooner it wears .
that thou art my son , i have partly thy mother word , partly my own opinion , but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a of thy nether lip , that doth warrant me .
if then thou be son to me , here lies the point , why , being son to me , art thou so pointed at ?
shall the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat blackberries ?
a question not to be asked .
shall the sun of england prove a thief and take purses ?
a question to be asked .
there is a thing , harry , which thou hast often heard of and it is known to many in our land by the name of pitch this pitch , as ancient writers do report , doth defile , so doth the company thou keepest for , harry , now i do not speak to thee in drink but in tears , not in pleasure but in passion , not in words only , but in woes also and yet there is a virtuous man whom i have often noted in thy company , but i know not his name .
what manner of man , an it like your majesty ?
a goodly portly man , i ' faith , and a corpulent , of a cheerful look , a pleasing eye and a most noble carriage , and , as i think , his age some fifty , or , by ' r lady , inclining to three score , and now i remember me , his name is falstaff if that man should be lewdly given , he deceiveth me , for , harry , i see virtue in his looks .
if then the tree may be known by the fruit , as the fruit by the tree , then , peremptorily i speak it , there is virtue in that falstaff him keep with , the rest banish .
and tell me now , thou naughty varlet , tell me , where hast thou been this month ?
dost thou speak like a king ?
do thou stand for me , and i play my father .
depose me ?
if thou dost it half so gravely , so majestically , both in word and matter , hang me up by the heels for a or a poulter hare .
well , here i am set .
and here i stand judge , my masters .
now , harry , whence come you ?
my noble lord , from eastcheap .
the complaints i hear of thee are grievous .
, my lord , they are false nay , i tickle ye for a young prince , i ' faith .
swearest thou , ungracious boy ?
henceforth look on me .
thou art violently carried away from grace there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an old fat man , a tun of man is thy companion .
why dost thou converse with that trunk of humours , that of beastliness , that swollen parcel of dropsies , that huge bombard of sack , that stuffed of guts , that roasted manningtree ox with the pudding in his belly , that reverend vice , that grey iniquity , that father ruffian , that vanity in years ?
wherein is he good , but to taste sack and drink it ?
wherein neat and cleanly , but to carve a capon and eat it ?
wherein cunning , but in craft ?
wherein crafty , but in villany ?
wherein villanous , but in all things ?
wherein worthy , but in nothing ?
i would your grace would take me with you whom means your grace ?
that villanous abominable misleader of youth , falstaff , that old satan .
my lord , the man i know .
i know thou dost .
but to say i know more harm in him than in myself , were to say more than i know .
that he is old , the more the pity , his white hairs do witness it , but that he is , saving your reverence , a whoremaster , that i utterly deny .
if sack and sugar be a fault , god help the wicked !
if to be old and merry be a sin , then many an old host that i know is damned if to be fat be to be hated , then pharaoh lean kine are to be loved .
no , my good lord , banish peto , banish bardolph , banish poins but for sweet jack falstaff , kind jack falstaff , true jack falstaff , valiant jack falstaff , and therefore more valiant , being , as he is , old jack falstaff , banish not him thy harry company , banish not him thy harry company banish plump jack , and banish all the world .
i do , i will .
a knocking heard exeunt hostess , francis , and bardolph bardolph , running o , my lord , my lord !
the sheriff with a most monstrous watch is at the door .
out , ye rogue !
play out the play i have much to say in the behalf of that falstaff .
the hostess o jesu , my lord , my lord !
heigh , heigh !
the devil rides upon a fiddlestick what the matter ?
the sheriff and all the watch are at the door they are come to search the house .
shall i let them in ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
never call a true piece of gold a counterfeit thou art essentially mad , without seeming so .
and thou a natural coward , without instinct .
i deny your major if you will deny the sheriff , so , if not , let him enter if i become not a cart as well as another man , a plague on my bringing up !
i hope i shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another .
go , hide thee behind the arras the rest walk up above .
now , my masters , for a true face and good conscience .
both which i have had but their date is out , and therefore i hide me .
call in the sheriff .
exeunt all except prince henry and peto enter sheriff and the carrier now , master sheriff , what is your will with me ?
first , pardon me , my lord .
a hue and cry hath follow certain men unto this house .
what men ?
one of them is well known , my gracious lord , a gross fat man .
as fat as butter .
the man , i do assure you , is not here , for i myself at this time have employ him .
and , sheriff , i will engage my word to thee that i will , by , send him to answer thee , or any man , for any thing he shall be charged withal and so let me entreat you leave the house .
i will , my lord .
there are two gentlemen have in this robbery lost three hundred marks .
it may be so if he have robb these men , he shall be answerable , and so farewell .
good night , my noble lord .

act iii scene bangor .
the archdeacon house .
enter hotspur , worcester , mortimer , and glendower these promises are fair , the parties sure , and our induction full of prosperous hope .
lord mortimer , and cousin glendower , will you sit down ?
and uncle worcester a plague upon it !
i have forgot the map .
no , here it is .
sit , cousin percy , sit , good cousin hotspur , for by that name as oft as lancaster doth speak of you , his cheek looks pale and with a rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven .
and you in hell , as oft as he hears owen glendower spoke of .
i can not blame him at my nativity the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , of burning cressets , and at my birth the frame and huge foundation of the earth shaked like a coward .
why , so it would have done at the same season , if your mother cat had but kittened , though yourself had never been born .
i say the earth did shake when i was born .
and i say the earth was not of my mind , if you suppose as fearing you it shook .
the heavens were all on fire , the earth did tremble .
o , then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire , and not in fear of your nativity .
diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth in strange eruptions , oft the teeming earth is with a kind of colic pinch and vex by the imprisoning of unruly wind within her womb , which , for enlargement striving , shakes the old beldam earth and topples down steeples and towers .
at your birth our grandam earth , having this distemperature , in passion shook .
cousin , of many men i do not bear these crossings .
give me leave to tell you once again that at my birth the front of heaven was full of fiery shapes , the goats ran from the mountains , and the herds were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields .
these signs have mark me extraordinary , and all the courses of my life do show i am not in the roll of common men .
where is he living , clipp in with the sea that chides the banks of england , scotland , wales , which calls me pupil , or hath read to me ?
and bring him out that is but woman son can trace me in the tedious ways of art and hold me pace in deep experiments .
i think there no man speaks better welsh .
i to dinner .
peace , cousin percy , you will make him mad .
i can call spirits from the vasty deep .
why , so can i , or so can any man , but will they come when you do call for them ?
why , i can teach you , cousin , to command the devil .
and i can teach thee , coz , to shame the devil by telling truth tell truth and shame the devil .
if thou have power to raise him , bring him hither , and i be sworn i have power to shame him hence .
o , while you live , tell truth and shame the devil !
come , come , no more of this unprofitable chat .
three times hath henry bolingbroke made head against my power , thrice from the banks of wye and severn have i sent him bootless home and back .
home without boots , and in foul weather too !
how he agues , in the devil name ?
come , here the map shall we divide our right according to our threefold order ?
the archdeacon hath divided it into three limits very equally england , from trent and severn hitherto , by south and east is to my part assign all westward , wales beyond the severn shore , and all the fertile land within that bound , to owen glendower and , dear coz , to you the remnant northward , lying off from trent .
and our indentures tripartite are drawn , which being sealed interchangeably , a business that this night may execute , , cousin percy , you and i and my good lord of worcester will set forth to meet your father and the scottish power , as is appointed us , at shrewsbury .
my father glendower is not ready yet , not shall we need his help these fourteen days .
within that space you may have drawn together your tenants , friends and neighbouring gentlemen .
a shorter time shall send me to you , lords and in my conduct shall your ladies come , from whom you now must steal and take no leave , for there will be a world of water shed upon the parting of your wives and you .
methinks my moiety , north from burton here , in quantity equals not one of yours see how this river comes me cranking in , and cuts me from the best of all my land a huge , a monstrous cantle out .
i have the current in this place damm up , and here the smug and silver trent shall run in a new channel , fair and evenly , it shall not wind with such a deep indent , to rob me of so rich a bottom here .
not wind ?
it shall , it must , you see it doth .
yea , but mark how he bears his course , and runs me up with like advantage on the other side , gelding the opposed continent as much as on the other side it takes from you .
yea , but a little charge will trench him here and on this north side win this cape of land , and then he runs straight and even .
i have it so a little charge will do it .
i not have it alter .
will not you ?
no , nor you shall not .
who shall say me nay ?
why , that will i .
let me not understand you , then , speak it in welsh .
i can speak english , lord , as well as you , for i was train up in the english court , where , being but young , i framed to the harp many an english ditty lovely well and gave the tongue a helpful ornament , a virtue that was never seen in you .
marry , and i am glad of it with all my heart i had rather be a kitten and cry mew than one of these same metre , i had rather hear a brazen canstick turn , or a dry wheel grate on the , and that would set my teeth nothing on edge , nothing so much as mincing poetry is like the forced gait of a shuffling nag .
come , you shall have trent turn .
i do not care i give thrice so much land to any friend , but in the way of bargain , mark ye me , i cavil on the ninth part of a hair .
are the indentures drawn ?
shall we be gone ?
the moon shines fair , you may away by night i haste the writer and withal break with your wives of your departure hence i am afraid my daughter will run mad , so much she doteth on her mortimer .
exit glendower fie , cousin percy !
how you cross my father !
i can not choose sometime he angers me with telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant , of the dreamer merlin and his prophecies , and of a dragon and a finless fish , a griffin and a moulten raven , a couching lion and a ramping cat , and such a deal of stuff as puts me from my faith .
i tell you what , he held me last night at least nine hours in reckoning up the several devils ' names that were his lackeys i cried , ' and , go to , ' but mark him not a word .
o , he is as tedious as a tired horse , a railing wife , worse than a smoky house i had rather live with cheese and garlic in a windmill , far , than feed on cates and have him talk to me in any in christendom .
in faith , he is a worthy gentleman , exceedingly well read , and profited in strange concealments , valiant as a lion and as wondrous affable and as bountiful as mines of india .
shall i tell you , cousin ?
he holds your temper in a high respect and curbs himself even of his natural scope when you come his humour , faith , he does i warrant you , that man is not alive might so have tempted him as you have done , without the taste of danger and reproof but do not use it oft , let me entreat you .
in faith , my lord , you are too , and since your coming hither have done enough to put him quite beside his patience .
you must needs learn , lord , to amend this fault though sometimes it show greatness , courage , blood , and that the dearest grace it renders you , yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage , defect of manners , want of government , pride , haughtiness , opinion and disdain the least of which haunting a nobleman loseth men hearts and leaves behind a stain upon the beauty of all parts besides , beguiling them of commendation .
well , i am school good manners be your speed !
here come our wives , and let us take our leave .
glendower with the ladies this is the deadly spite that angers me , my wife can speak no english , i no welsh .
my daughter weeps she will not part with you , she be a soldier too , she to the wars .
good father , tell her that she and my aunt percy shall follow in your conduct speedily .
glendower speaks to her in welsh , and she answers him in the same she is desperate here , a peevish harlotry , one that no persuasion can do good upon .
the lady speaks in welsh i understand thy looks that pretty welsh which thou down from these swelling heavens i am too perfect in , and , but for shame , in such a parley should i answer thee .
the lady speaks again in welsh i understand thy kisses and thou mine , and that a feeling disputation but i will never be a truant , love , till i have learned thy language , for thy tongue makes welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn , sung by a fair queen in a summer bower , with ravishing division , to her lute .
nay , if you melt , then will she run mad .
the lady speaks again in welsh o , i am ignorance itself in this !
she bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down and rest your gentle head upon her lap , and she will sing the song that pleaseth you and on your eyelids crown the god of sleep .
charming your blood with pleasing heaviness , making such difference wake and sleep as is the difference betwixt day and night the hour before the team begins his golden progress in the east .
with all my heart i sit and hear her sing by that time will our book , i think , be drawn do so , and those musicians that shall play to you hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence , and straight they shall be here sit , and attend .
come , kate , thou art perfect in lying down come , quick , quick , that i may lay my head in thy lap .
go , ye giddy goose .
the music plays now i perceive the devil understands welsh , and is no marvel he is so humorous .
by ' r lady , he is a good musician .
then should you be nothing but musical for you are altogether governed by humours .
lie still , ye thief , and hear the lady sing in welsh .
i had rather hear lady , my brach , howl in irish .
wouldst thou have thy head broken ?
no .
then be still .
neither , is a woman fault .
now god help thee !
to the welsh lady bed .
what that ?
peace !
she sings .
here the lady sings a welsh song come , kate , i have your song too .
not mine , in good sooth .
not yours , in good sooth !
heart !
you swear like a wife .
you , in good sooth , ' and true as i live , ' and god shall mend me , ' and sure as day , ' and givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths , as if thou never further than finsbury .
swear me , kate , like a lady as thou art , a good oath , and leave sooth , ' and such protest of , to and .
come , sing .
i will not sing .
is the next way to turn tailor , or be teacher .
an the indentures be drawn , i away within these two hours , and so , come in when ye will .
exit come , come , lord mortimer , you are as slow as hot lord percy is on fire to go .
by this our book is drawn , we but seal , and then to horse immediately .
with all my heart .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
the palace .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , and others lords , give us leave , the prince of wales and i must have some private conference , but be near at hand , for we shall presently have need of you .
exeunt lords i know not whether god will have it so , for some displeasing service i have done , that , in his secret doom , out of my blood he breed revengement and a scourge for me , but thou dost in thy passages of life make me believe that thou art only mark for the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven to punish my mistreadings .
tell me else , could such inordinate and low desires , such poor , such bare , such lewd , such mean attempts , such barren pleasures , rude society , as thou art match withal and grafted to , accompany the greatness of thy blood and hold their level with thy princely heart ?
so please your majesty , i would i could quit all offences with as clear excuse as well as i am doubtless i can purge myself of many i am charged withal yet such extenuation let me beg , as , in reproof of many tales devised , which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear , by smiling and base , i may , for some things true , wherein my youth hath faulty wander and irregular , find pardon on my true submission .
god pardon thee !
yet let me wonder , harry , at thy affections , which do hold a wing quite from the flight of all thy ancestors .
thy place in council thou hast rudely lost .
which by thy younger brother is supplied , and art almost an alien to the hearts of all the court and princes of my blood the hope and expectation of thy time is ruin , and the soul of every man prophetically doth forethink thy fall .
had i so lavish of my presence been , so in the eyes of men , so stale and cheap to vulgar company , opinion , that did help me to the crown , had still kept loyal to possession and left me in reputeless banishment , a fellow of no mark nor likelihood .
by being seldom seen , i could not stir but like a comet i was wonder at , that men would tell their children is he , ' others would say , which is bolingbroke ? '
and then i stole all courtesy from heaven , and dress myself in such humility that i did pluck allegiance from men hearts , loud shouts and salutations from their mouths , even in the presence of the crowned king .
thus did i keep my person fresh and new , my presence , like a robe pontifical , seen but wonder at and so my state , seldom but sumptuous , showed like a feast and won by rareness such solemnity .
the skipping king , he ambled up and down with shallow jesters and rash bavin wits , soon kindled and soon burnt , carded his state , mingled his royalty with capering fools , had his great name profaned with their scorns and gave his countenance , against his name , to laugh at gibing boys and stand the push of every beardless vain comparative , grew a companion to the common streets , enfeoff himself to popularity , that , being daily swallow by men eyes , they surfeited with honey and began to loathe the taste of sweetness , whereof a little more than a little is by much too much .
so when he had occasion to be seen , he was but as the cuckoo is in june , heard , not regarded , seen , but with such eyes as , sick and blunted with community , afford no extraordinary gaze , such as is bent on majesty when it shines seldom in admiring eyes , but rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down , slept in his face and render such aspect as cloudy men use to their adversaries , being with his presence glutted , gorged and full .
and in that very line , harry , standest thou , for thou has lost thy princely privilege with vile participation not an eye but is of thy common sight , save mine , which hath desired to see thee more , which now doth that i would not have it do , make blind itself with foolish tenderness .
i shall hereafter , my thrice gracious lord , be more myself .
for all the world as thou art to this hour was richard then when i from france set foot at ravenspurgh , and even as i was then is percy now .
now , by my sceptre and my soul to boot , he hath more worthy interest to the state than thou the shadow of succession , for of no right , nor colour like to right , he doth fill fields with harness in the realm , turns head against the lion armed jaws , and , being no more in debt to years than thou , leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on to bloody battles and to bruising arms .
what honour hath he got against renowned douglas !
whose high deeds , whose hot incursions and great name in arms holds from all soldiers chief majority and military title capital through all the kingdoms that acknowledge christ thrice hath this hotspur , mars in swathling clothes , this infant warrior , in his enterprises discomfited great douglas , him once , enlarged him and made a friend of him , to fill the mouth of deep defiance up and shake the peace and safety of our throne .
and what say you to this ?
percy , northumberland , the archbishop grace of york , douglas , mortimer , capitulate against us and are up .
but wherefore do i tell these news to thee ?
why , harry , do i tell thee of my foes , which art my and dearest enemy ?
thou that art like enough , through vassal fear , base inclination and the start of spleen to fight against me under percy pay , to dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns , to show how much thou art degenerate .
do not think so , you shall not find it so and god forgive them that so much have sway your majesty good thoughts away from me !
i will redeem all this on percy head and in the closing of some glorious day be bold to tell you that i am your son , when i will wear a garment all of blood and stain my favours in a bloody mask , which , wash away , shall scour my shame with it and that shall be the day , it lights , that this same child of honour and renown , this gallant hotspur , this knight , and your harry chance to meet .
for every honour sitting on his helm , would they were multitudes , and on my head my shames redoubled !
for the time will come , that i shall make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities .
percy is but my factor , good my lord , to engross up glorious deeds on my behalf , and i will call him to so strict account , that he shall render every glory up , yea , even the slightest worship of his time , or i will tear the reckoning from his heart .
this , in the name of god , i promise here the which if he be pleased i shall perform , i do beseech your majesty may salve the wounds of my intemperance if not , the end of life cancels all bands , and i will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow .
a hundred thousand rebels die in this thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein .
enter blunt how now , good blunt ?
thy looks are full of speed .
so hath the business that i come to speak of .
lord mortimer of scotland hath sent word that douglas and the english rebels met the eleventh of this month at shrewsbury a mighty and a fearful head they are , if promises be kept on every hand , as ever offer foul play in the state .
the earl of westmoreland set forth , with him my son , lord john of lancaster , for this advertisement is five days old on wednesday next , harry , you shall set forward , on thursday we ourselves will march our meeting is bridgenorth and , harry , you shall march through gloucestershire , by which account , our business valued , some twelve days hence our general forces at bridgenorth shall meet .
our hands are full of business let away , advantage feeds him fat , while men delay .
exeunt eastcheap .
the tavern .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , am i not fallen away vilely since this last action ?
do i not bate ?
do i not dwindle ?
why my skin hangs about me like an like an old lady loose gown , i am withered like an old .
well , i repent , and that suddenly , while i am in some liking , i shall be out of heart shortly , and then i shall have no strength to repent .
an i have not forgotten what the inside of a church is made of , i am a peppercorn , a brewer horse the inside of a church !
company , villanous company , hath been the spoil of me .
sir john , you are so fretful , you can not live long .
why , there is it come sing me a bawdy song , make me merry .
i was as virtuously given as a gentleman need to be , virtuous enough , swore little , diced not above seven times a week , went to a once in a quarter of an hour , paid money that i borrowed , three of four times , lived well and in good compass and now i live out of all order , out of all compass .
why , you are so fat , sir john , that you must needs be out of all compass , out of all reasonable compass , sir john .
do thou amend thy face , and i amend my life thou art our admiral , thou bearest the lantern in the poop , but is in the nose of thee , thou art the knight of the burning lamp .
why , sir john , my face does you no harm .
no , i be sworn , i make as good use of it as many a man doth of a or a memento mori i never see thy face but i think upon and dives that lived in purple , for there he is in his robes , burning , burning .
if thou wert any way given to virtue , i would swear by thy face , my oath should be this fire , that god angel ' but thou art altogether given over , and wert indeed , but for the light in thy face , the son of utter darkness .
when thou rannest up gadshill in the night to catch my horse , if i did not think thou hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire , there no purchase in money .
o , thou art a perpetual triumph , an everlasting !
thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and torches , walking with thee in the night betwixt tavern and tavern but the sack that thou hast drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap at the dearest chandler in europe .
i have maintained that salamander of yours with fire any time this two and thirty years , god reward me for it !
, i would my face were in your belly !
!
so should i be sure to be .
enter hostess how now , dame partlet the hen !
have you inquired yet who picked my pocket ?
why , sir john , what do you think , sir john ?
do you think i keep thieves in my house ?
i have searched , i have inquired , so has my husband , man by man , boy by boy , servant by servant the tithe of a hair was never lost in my house before .
ye lie , hostess bardolph was shaved and lost many a hair , and i be sworn my pocket was picked .
go to , you are a woman , go .
who , i ?
no , i defy thee god light , i was never called so in mine own house before .
go to , i know you well enough .
no , sir john , you do not know me , sir john .
i know you , sir john you owe me money , sir john , and now you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it i bought you a dozen of shirts to your back .
dowlas , filthy dowlas i have given them away to bakers ' wives , and they have made bolters of them .
now , as i am a true woman , holland of eight shillings an ell .
you owe money here besides , sir john , for your diet and , and money lent you , four and twenty pound .
he had his part of it , let him pay .
he ?
alas , he is poor , he hath nothing .
how !
poor ?
look upon his face , what call you rich ?
let them coin his nose , let them coin his cheeks ill not pay a denier .
what , will you make a younker of me ?
shall i not take mine case in mine inn but i shall have my pocket picked ?
i have lost a of my grandfather worth forty mark .
o jesu , i have heard the prince tell him , i know not how oft , that ring was copper !
how !
the prince is a jack , a , an he were here , i would cudgel him like a dog , if he would say so .
enter prince henry and peto , marching , and falstaff meets them playing on his truncheon like a life how now , lad !
is the wind in that door , i ' faith ?
must we all march ?
yea , two and two , newgate fashion .
my lord , i pray you , hear me .
what sayest thou , mistress quickly ?
how doth thy husband ?
i love him well , he is an honest man .
good my lord , hear me .
prithee , let her alone , and list to me .
what sayest thou , jack ?
the other night i fell asleep here behind the arras and had my pocket picked this house is turned , they pick pockets .
what didst thou lose , jack ?
wilt thou believe me , hal ?
three or four bonds of forty pound apiece , and a of my grandfather .
a trifle , some matter .
so i told him , my lord , and i said i heard your grace say so and , my lord , he speaks most vilely of you , like a man as he is , and said he would cudgel you .
what !
he did not ?
there neither faith , truth , nor womanhood in me else .
there no more faith in thee than in a stewed prune , nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn fox , and for womanhood , maid marian may be the deputy wife of the ward to thee .
go , you thing , go say , what thing ?
what thing ?
what thing !
why , a thing to thank god on .
i am no thing to thank god on , i would thou shouldst know it , i am an honest man wife and , setting thy knighthood aside , thou art a knave to call me so .
setting thy womanhood aside , thou art a beast to say otherwise .
say , what beast , thou knave , thou ?
what beast !
why , an otter .
an otter , sir john !
why an otter ?
why , she neither fish nor flesh , a man knows not where to have her .
thou art an unjust man in saying so thou or any man knows where to have me , thou knave , thou !
thou sayest true , hostess , and he slanders thee most grossly .
so he doth you , my lord , and said this other day you ought him a thousand pound .
sirrah , do i owe you a thousand pound ?
a thousand pound , ha !
a million thy love is worth a million thou owest me thy love .
nay , my lord , he called you jack , and said he would cudgel you .
did i , bardolph ?
indeed , sir john , you said so .
yea , if he said my ring was copper .
i say is copper darest thou be as good as thy word now ?
why , hal , thou knowest , as thou art but man , i dare but as thou art prince , i fear thee as i fear the roaring of a lion whelp .
and why not as the lion ?
the king is to be feared as the lion dost thou think i fear thee as i fear thy father ?
nay , an i do , i pray god my girdle break .
o , if it should , how would thy guts fall about thy knees !
but , sirrah , there no room for faith , truth , nor honesty in this bosom of thine , it is all filled up with guts and midriff .
charge an honest woman with picking thy pocket !
why , thou whoreson , impudent , embossed rascal , if there were anything in thy pocket but , memorandums of , and one poor of to make thee , if thy pocket were enriched with any other injuries but these , i am a villain and yet you will stand to if , you will not pocket up wrong art thou not ashamed ?
dost thou hear , hal ?
thou knowest in the state of innocency adam fell , and what should poor jack falstaff do in the days of villany ?
thou seest i have more flesh than another man , and therefore more frailty .
you confess then , you picked my pocket ?
it appears so by the story .
hostess , i forgive thee go , make ready breakfast , love thy husband , look to thy servants , cherish thy guests thou shalt find me tractable to any honest reason thou seest i am pacified still .
nay , prithee , be gone .
exit hostess now hal , to the news at court for the robbery , lad , how is that answered ?
o , my sweet beef , i must still be good angel to thee the money is paid back again .
o , i do not like that paying back , is a double labour .
i am good friends with my father and may do any thing .
rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest , and do it with unwashed hands too .
do , my lord .
i have procured thee , jack , a charge of foot .
i would it had been of horse .
where shall i find one that can steal well ?
o for a fine thief , of the age of two and twenty or thereabouts !
i am heinously unprovided .
well , god be thanked for these rebels , they offend none but the virtuous i laud them , i praise them .
bardolph !
my lord ?
go bear this letter to lord john of lancaster , to my brother john , this to my lord of westmoreland .
exit bardolph go , peto , to horse , to horse , for thou and i have thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time .
exit peto jack , meet me in the temple hall at two in the afternoon .
there shalt thou know thy charge , and there receive money and order for their furniture .
the land is burning , percy stands on high , and either we or they must lower lie .
exit prince henry rare words !
brave world !
hostess , my breakfast , come !
o , i could wish this tavern were my drum !
exit act iv scene i .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , and douglas well said , my noble scot if speaking truth in this fine age were not thought flattery , such attribution should the douglas have , as not a soldier of this season stamp should go so general current through the world .
by god , i can not flatter , i do defy the tongues of soothers , but a braver place in my heart love hath no man than yourself nay , task me to my word , approve me , lord .
thou art the king of honour no man so potent breathes upon the ground but i will beard him .
do so , and is well .
enter a messenger with letters what letters hast thou there ? i can but thank you .
these letters come from your father .
letters from him !
why comes he not himself ?
he can not come , my lord , he is grievous sick .
!
how has he the leisure to be sick in such a rustling time ?
who leads his power ?
under whose government come they along ?
his letters bear his mind , not i , my lord .
i prithee , tell me , doth he keep his bed ?
he did , my lord , four days ere i set forth , and at the time of my departure thence he was much fear by his physicians .
i would the state of time had first been whole ere he by sickness had been visited his health was never better worth than now .
sick now !
droop now !
this sickness doth infect the very of our enterprise , is catching hither , even to our camp .
he writes me here , that inward sickness and that his friends by deputation could not so soon be drawn , nor did he think it meet to lay so dangerous and dear a trust on any soul removed but on his own .
yet doth he give us bold advertisement , that with our small conjunction we should on , to see how fortune is disposed to us , for , as he writes , there is no quailing now .
because the king is certainly possess of all our purposes .
what say you to it ?
your father sickness is a maim to us .
a perilous gash , a very limb lopp off and yet , in faith , it is not , his present want seems more than we shall find it were it good to set the exact wealth of all our states all at one cast ?
to set so rich a main on the nice hazard of one doubtful hour ?
it were not good , for therein should we read the very bottom and the soul of hope , the very list , the very utmost bound of all our fortunes .
, and so we should , where now remains a sweet reversion we may boldly spend upon the hope of what is to come in a comfort of retirement lives in this .
a rendezvous , a home to fly unto .
if that the devil and mischance look big upon the maidenhead of our affairs .
but yet i would your father had been here .
the quality and hair of our attempt brooks no division it will be thought by some , that know not why he is away , that wisdom , loyalty and mere dislike of our proceedings kept the earl from hence and think how such an apprehension may turn the tide of fearful faction and breed a kind of question in our cause , for well you know we of the offering side must keep aloof from strict arbitrement , and stop all , every loop from whence the eye of reason may pry in upon us this absence of your father draws a curtain , that shows the ignorant a kind of fear before not dreamt of .
you strain too far .
i rather of his absence make this use it lends a lustre and more great opinion , a larger dare to our great enterprise , than if the earl were here , for men must think , if we without his help can make a head to push against a kingdom , with his help we shall it down .
yet all goes well , yet all our joints are whole .
as heart can think there is not such a word spoke of in scotland as this term of fear .
enter sir richard vernon my cousin vernon , welcome , by my soul .
pray god my news be worth a welcome , lord .
the earl of westmoreland , seven thousand strong , is marching hitherwards , with him prince john .
no harm what more ?
and further , i have learn , the king himself in person is set forth , or hitherwards intended speedily , with strong and mighty preparation .
he shall be welcome too .
where is his son , the madcap prince of wales , and his comrades , that daff the world aside , and bid it pass ?
all furnish , all in arms , all plumed like estridges that with the wind baited like eagles having lately bathed , glittering in golden coats , like images , as full of spirit as the month of may , and gorgeous as the sun at midsummer , wanton as youthful goats , wild as young bulls .
i saw young harry , with his beaver on , his cuisses on his thighs , gallantly arm rise from the ground like feather mercury , and vaulted with such ease into his seat , as if an angel dropp down from the clouds , to turn and wind a fiery pegasus and witch the world with noble horsemanship .
no more , no more worse than the sun in march , this praise doth nourish agues .
let them come they come like sacrifices in their trim , and to the maid of smoky war all hot and bleeding will we offer them the mailed mars shall on his altar sit up to the ears in blood .
i am on fire to hear this rich reprisal is so nigh and yet not ours .
come , let me taste my horse , who is to bear me like a thunderbolt against the bosom of the prince of wales harry to harry shall , hot horse to horse , meet and part till one drop down a corse .
o that glendower were come !
there is more news i learn in worcester , as i rode along , he can not draw his power this fourteen days .
that the worst tidings that i hear of yet .
ay , by my faith , that bears a frosty sound .
what may the king whole battle reach unto ?
to thirty thousand .
forty let it be my father and glendower being both away , the powers of us may serve so great a day come , let us take a muster speedily doomsday is near , die all , die merrily .
talk not of dying i am out of fear of death or death hand for this year .
exeunt scene ii .
a public road near coventry .
enter falstaff and bardolph bardolph , get thee before to coventry , fill me a bottle of sack our soldiers shall march through , we to sutton ' tonight .
will you give me money , captain ?
lay out , lay out .
this bottle makes an angel .
an if it do , take it for thy labour , and if it make twenty , take them all , i answer the coinage .
bid my lieutenant peto meet me at town end .
i will , captain farewell .
exit if i be not ashamed of my soldiers , i am a soused gurnet .
i have misused the king press damnably .
i have got , in exchange of a hundred and fifty soldiers , three hundred and odd pounds .
i press me none but good , yeoman sons , inquire me out contracted bachelors , such as had been asked twice on the banns , such a commodity of warm slaves , as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum , such as fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck fowl or a hurt .
i pressed me none but such , with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins ' heads , and they have bought out their services , and now my whole charge consists of ancients , corporals , lieutenants , gentlemen of companies , slaves as ragged as lazarus in the painted cloth , where the glutton dogs licked his sores , and such as indeed were never soldiers , but discarded unjust , younger sons to younger brothers , revolted tapsters and ostlers , the cankers of a calm world and a long peace , ten times more dishonourable ragged than an old faced ancient and such have i , to fill up the rooms of them that have bought out their services , that you would think that i had a hundred and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from , from eating draff and husks .
a mad fellow met me on the way and told me i had unloaded all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies .
no eye hath seen such scarecrows .
i not march through coventry with them , that flat nay , and the villains march wide betwixt the legs , as if they had gyves on , for indeed i had the most of them out of prison .
there but a shirt and a half in all my company , and the half shirt is two napkins tacked together and thrown over the shoulders like an herald coat without sleeves , and the shirt , to say the truth , stolen from my host at saint alban , or the innkeeper of daventry .
but that all one , they find linen enough on every hedge .
enter the prince and westmoreland how now , blown jack !
how now , quilt !
what , hal !
how now , mad wag !
what a devil dost thou in warwickshire ?
my good lord of westmoreland , i cry you mercy i thought your honour had already been at shrewsbury .
faith , sir john , is more than time that i were there , and you too , but my powers are there already .
the king , i can tell you , looks for us all we must away all night .
tut , never fear me i am as vigilant as a cat to steal cream .
i think , to steal cream indeed , for thy theft hath already made thee butter .
but tell me , jack , whose fellows are these that come after ?
mine , hal , mine .
i did never see such pitiful rascals .
tut , tut , good enough to toss , food for powder , food for powder , they fill a pit as well as better tush , man , mortal men , mortal men .
ay , but , sir john , methinks they are exceeding poor and bare , too beggarly .
, for their poverty , i know not where they had that , and for their bareness , i am sure they never learned that of me .
no i be sworn , unless you call three fingers on the ribs bare .
but , sirrah , make haste percy is already in the field .
what , is the king encamped ?
he is , sir john i fear we shall stay too long .
well , to the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast fits a dull fighter and a keen guest .
exeunt scene iii .
the rebel camp near shrewsbury .
enter hotspur , worcester , douglas , and vernon we fight with him .
it may not be .
you give him then the advantage .
not a whit .
why say you so ?
looks he not for supply ?
so do we .
his is certain , ours is doubtful .
good cousin , be advised , stir not tonight .
do not , my lord .
you do not counsel well you speak it out of fear and cold heart .
do me no slander , douglas by my life , and i dare well maintain it with my life , if honour bid me on , i hold as little counsel with weak fear as you , my lord , or any scot that this day lives let it be seen in the battle which of us fears .
yea , or .
content .
, say i .
come , come it nay not be .
i wonder much , being men of such great leading as you are , that you foresee not what impediments drag back our expedition certain horse of my cousin vernon are not yet come up your uncle worcester horse came but today , and now their pride and mettle is asleep , their courage with hard labour tame and dull , that not a horse is half the half of himself .
so are the horses of the enemy in general , and brought low the better part of ours are full of rest .
the number of the king exceedeth ours for god sake .
cousin , stay till all come in .
the trumpet sounds a parley enter sir walter blunt i come with gracious offers from the king , if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect .
welcome , sir walter blunt , and would to god you were of our determination !
some of us love you well , and even those some envy your great deservings and good name , because you are not of our quality , but stand against us like an enemy .
and god defend but still i should stand so , so long as out of limit and true rule you stand against anointed majesty .
but to my charge .
the king hath sent to know the nature of your griefs , and whereupon you conjure from the breast of civil peace such bold hostility , teaching his duteous land audacious cruelty .
if that the king have any way your good deserts forgot , which he confesseth to be manifold , he bids you name your griefs , and with all speed you shall have your desires with interest and pardon absolute for yourself and these herein misled by your suggestion .
the king is kind , and well we know the king knows at what time to promise , when to pay .
my father and my uncle and myself did give him that same royalty he wears , and when he was not six and twenty strong , sick in the world regard , wretched and low , a poor unminded outlaw sneaking home , my father gave him welcome to the shore , and when he heard him swear and vow to god he came but to be duke of lancaster , to sue his livery and beg his peace , with tears of innocency and terms of zeal , my father , in kind heart and pity moved , swore him assistance and perform it too .
now when the lords and barons of the realm perceived northumberland did lean to him , the more and less came in with cap and knee , met him in boroughs , cities , villages , attended him on bridges , stood in lanes , laid gifts before him , proffer him their oaths , gave him their heirs , as pages follow him even at the heels in golden multitudes .
he presently , as greatness knows itself , steps me a little higher than his vow made to my father , while his blood was poor , upon the naked shore at ravenspurgh , and now , forsooth , takes on him to reform some certain edicts and some strait decrees that lie too heavy on the commonwealth , cries out upon abuses , seems to weep over his country wrongs , and by this face , this seeming brow of justice , did he win the hearts of all that he did angle for , proceeded further , cut me off the heads of all the favourites that the absent king in deputation left behind him here , when he was personal in the irish war .
tut , i came not to hear this .
then to the point .
in short time after , he deposed the king , soon after that , deprived him of his life , and in the neck of that , task the whole state to make that worse , suffer his kinsman march , who is , if every owner were well placed , indeed his king , to be engaged in wales , there without ransom to lie forfeited , disgraced me in my happy victories , sought to entrap me by intelligence , rated mine uncle from the , in rage dismiss my father from the court , broke oath on oath , committed wrong on wrong , and in conclusion drove us to seek out this head of safety , and withal to pry into his title , the which we find too indirect for long continuance .
shall i return this answer to the king ?
not so , sir walter we withdraw awhile .
go to the king , and let there be impawn some surety for a safe return again , and in the morning early shall my uncle bring him our purposes and so farewell .
i would you would accept of grace and love .
and may be so we shall .
pray god you do .
exeunt scene iv .
york .
the archbishop palace .
enter the archbishop of york and sir michael hie , good sir michael , bear this sealed brief with winged haste to the lord marshal , this to my cousin scroop , and all the rest to whom they are directed .
if you knew how much they do to import , you would make haste .
my good lord , i guess their tenor .
like enough you do .
, good sir michael , is a day wherein the fortune of ten thousand men must bide the touch , for , sir , at shrewsbury , as i am truly given to understand , the king with mighty and power meets with lord harry and , i fear , sir michael , what with the sickness of northumberland , whose power was in the first proportion , and what with owen glendower absence thence , who with them was a rated sinew too and comes not in , by prophecies , i fear the power of percy is too weak to wage an instant trial with the king .
why , my good lord , you need not fear , there is douglas and lord mortimer .
no , mortimer is not there .
but there is mordake , vernon , lord harry percy , and there is my lord of worcester and a head of gallant warriors , noble gentlemen .
and so there is but yet the king hath drawn the special head of all the land together the prince of wales , lord john of lancaster , the noble westmoreland and warlike blunt , and moe corrivals and dear men of estimation and command in arms .
doubt not , my lord , they shall be well opposed .
i hope no less , yet needful is to fear , and , to prevent the worst , sir michael , speed for if lord percy thrive not , ere the king dismiss his power , he means to visit us , for he hath heard of our confederacy , and is but wisdom to make strong against him therefore make haste .
i must go write again to other friends , and so farewell , sir michael .
exeunt act v scene i .
king henry iv camp near shrewsbury .
enter king henry , prince henry , lord john of lancaster , earl of westmoreland , sir walter blunt , and falstaff how bloodily the sun begins to peer above yon busky hill !
the day looks pale at his distemperature .
the southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes , and by his hollow whistling in the leaves foretells a tempest and a blustering day .
then with the losers let it sympathize , for nothing can seem foul to those that win .
the trumpet sounds enter worcester and vernon how now , my lord of worcester !
is not well that you and i should meet upon such terms as now we meet .
you have deceived our trust , and made us doff our easy robes of peace , to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel this is not well , my lord , this is not well .
what say you to it ?
will you again unknit this curlish knot of war ?
and move in that obedient orb again where you did give a fair and natural light , and be no more an exhaled meteor , a prodigy of fear and a portent of broached mischief to the unborn times ?
hear me , my liege for mine own part , i could be well content to entertain the of my life with quiet hours , for i do protest , i have not sought the day of this dislike .
you have not sought it !
how comes it , then ?
rebellion lay in his way , and he found it .
peace , chewet , peace !
it pleased your majesty to turn your looks of favour from myself and all our house , and yet i must remember you , my lord , we were the first and dearest of your friends .
for you my staff of office did i break in richard time , and posted day and night to meet you on the way , and kiss your hand , when yet you were in place and in account nothing so strong and fortunate as i .
it was myself , my brother and his son , that brought you home and boldly did outdare the dangers of the time .
you swore to us , and you did swear that oath at doncaster , that you did nothing purpose the state , nor claim no further than your right , the seat of gaunt , dukedom of lancaster to this we swore our aid .
but in short space it rain down fortune showering on your head , and such a flood of greatness fell on you , what with our help , what with the absent king , what with the injuries of a wanton time , the seeming sufferances that you had borne , and the contrarious winds that held the king so long in his unlucky irish wars that all in england did repute him dead and from this swarm of fair advantages you took occasion to be quickly woo to gripe the general sway into your hand , forget your oath to us at doncaster , and being fed by us you used us so as that ungentle hull , the cuckoo bird , useth the sparrow , did oppress our nest , grew by our feeding to so great a bulk that even our love durst not come near your sight for fear of swallowing , but with nimble wing we were enforced , for safety sake , to fly out of sight and raise this present head , whereby we stand opposed by such means as you yourself have forged against yourself by unkind usage , dangerous countenance , and violation of all faith and troth sworn to us in your younger enterprise .
these things indeed you have articulate , proclaim at , read in churches , to face the garment of rebellion with some fine colour that may please the eye of fickle changelings and poor discontents , which gape and rub the elbow at the news of hurlyburly innovation and never yet did insurrection want such to impaint his cause , nor moody beggars , starving for a time of pellmell havoc and confusion .
in both your armies there is many a soul shall pay full dearly for this encounter , if once they join in trial .
tell your nephew , the prince of wales doth join with all the world in praise of henry percy by my hopes , this present enterprise set off his head , i do not think a braver gentleman , more or more , more daring or more bold , is now alive to grace this latter age with noble deeds .
for my part , i may speak it to my shame , i have a truant been to chivalry , and so i hear he doth account me too , yet this before my father majesty i am content that he shall take the odds of his great name and estimation , and will , to save the blood on either side , try fortune with him in a single fight .
and , prince of wales , so dare we venture thee , albeit considerations infinite do make against it .
no , good worcester , no , we love our people well , even those we love that are misled upon your cousin part , and , will they take the offer of our grace , both he and they and you , every man shall be my friend again and i be his so tell your cousin , and bring me word what he will do but if he will not yield , rebuke and dread correction wait on us and they shall do their office .
so , be gone , we will not now be troubled with reply we offer fair , take it advisedly .
exeunt worcester and vernon it will not be accepted , on my life the douglas and the hotspur both together are confident against the world in arms .
hence , therefore , every leader to his charge , for , on their answer , will we set on them and god befriend us , as our cause is just !
exeunt all but prince henry and falstaff hal , if thou see me down in the battle and bestride me , so , is a point of friendship .
nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship .
say thy prayers , and farewell .
i would , hal , and all well .
why , thou owest god a death .
exit prince henry is not due yet , i would be loath to pay him before his day .
what need i be so forward with him that calls not on me ?
well , is no matter , honour pricks me on .
yea , but how if honour prick me off when i come on ?
how then ?
can honour set to a leg ?
no or an arm ?
no or take away the grief of a wound ?
no .
honour hath no skill in surgery , then ?
no .
what is honour ?
a word .
what is in that word honour ?
what is that honour ?
air .
a trim reckoning !
who hath it ?
he that died o ' wednesday .
doth he feel it ?
no .
doth he hear it ?
no .
is insensible , then .
yea , to the dead .
but will it not live with the living ?
no .
why ?
detraction will not suffer it .
therefore i none of it .
honour is a mere scutcheon and so ends my catechism .
exit scene ii .
the rebel camp .
enter worcester and vernon o , no , my nephew must not know , sir richard , the liberal and kind offer of the king .
best he did .
then are we all undone .
it is not possible , it can not be , the king should keep his word in loving us , he will suspect us still and find a time to punish this offence in other faults suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes , for treason is but trusted like the fox , who , so tame , so cherish and lock up , will have a wild trick of his ancestors .
look how we can , or sad or merrily , interpretation will misquote our looks , and we shall feed like oxen at a stall , the better cherish , still the nearer death .
my nephew trespass may be well forgot , it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood , and an adopted name of privilege , a hotspur , govern by a spleen all his offences live upon my head and on his father , we did train him on , and , his corruption being from us , we , as the spring of all , shall pay for all .
therefore , good cousin , let not harry know , in any case , the offer of the king .
deliver what you will , i say is so .
here comes your cousin .
enter hotspur and douglas my uncle is return deliver up my lord of westmoreland .
uncle , what news ?
the king will bid you battle presently .
defy him by the lord of westmoreland .
lord douglas , go you and tell him so .
marry , and shall , and very willingly .
exit there is no seeming mercy in the king .
did you beg any ?
god forbid !
i told him gently of our grievances , of his , which he mended thus , by now forswearing that he is forsworn he calls us rebels , traitors , and will scourge with haughty arms this hateful name in us .
the earl of douglas arm , gentlemen , to arms !
for i have thrown a brave defiance in king henry teeth , and westmoreland , that was engaged , did bear it , which can not choose but bring him quickly on .
the prince of wales stepp forth before the king , and , nephew , challenged you to single fight .
o , would the quarrel lay upon our heads , and that no man might draw short breath today but i and harry monmouth !
tell me , tell me , how show his tasking ?
seem it in contempt ?
no , by my soul , i never in my life did hear a challenge urged more modestly , unless a brother should a brother dare to gentle exercise and proof of arms .
he gave you all the duties of a man , trimm up your praises with a princely tongue , spoke to your deservings like a chronicle , making you ever better than his praise by still dispraising praise valued in you , and , which became him like a prince indeed , he made a blushing cital of himself , and chid his truant youth with such a grace as if he master there a double spirit .
of teaching and of learning instantly .
there did he pause but let me tell the world , if he outlive the envy of this day , england did never owe so sweet a hope , so much misconstrued in his wantonness .
cousin , i think thou art enamoured on his follies never did i hear of any prince so wild a libertine .
but be he as he will , yet once ere night i will embrace him with a soldier arm , that he shall shrink under my courtesy .
arm , arm with speed and , fellows , soldiers , friends , better consider what you have to do than i , that have not well the gift of tongue , can lift your blood up with persuasion .
enter a messenger my lord , here are letters for you .
i can not read them now .
o gentlemen , the time of life is short !
to spend that shortness basely were too long , if life did ride upon a dial point , still ending at the arrival of an hour .
an if we live , we live to tread on kings , if die , brave death , when princes die with us !
now , for our consciences , the arms are fair , when the intent of bearing them is just .
enter another messenger my lord , prepare , the king comes on apace .
i thank him , that he cuts me from my tale , for i profess not talking , only this let each man do his best and here draw i a sword , whose temper i intend to stain with the best blood that i can meet withal in the adventure of this perilous day .
now , esperance !
percy !
and set on .
sound all the lofty instruments of war , and by that music let us all embrace , for , heaven to earth , some of us never shall a second time do such a courtesy .

what honour dost thou seek upon my head ?
know then , my name is douglas , and i do haunt thee in the battle thus because some tell me that thou art a king .
they tell thee true .
the lord of stafford dear hath bought thy likeness , for instead of thee , king harry , this sword hath ended him so shall it thee , unless thou yield thee as my prisoner .
i was not born a yielder , thou proud scot , and thou shalt find a king that will revenge lord stafford death .
they fight .
douglas kills sir walter blunt .

but who comes here ?
enter prince henry what , thou idle here ?
lend me thy sword many a nobleman lies stark and stiff under the hoofs of vaunting enemies , whose deaths are yet unrevenged i prithee , lend me thy sword .
o hal , i prithee , give me leave to breathe awhile .
turk gregory never did such deeds in arms as i have done this day .
i have paid percy , i have made him sure .
he is , indeed , and living to kill thee .
i prithee , lend me thy sword .
nay , before god , hal , if percy be alive , thou not my sword , but take my pistol , if thou wilt .
give it to me what , is it in the case ?
ay , hal , is hot , is hot , there that will sack a city .
prince henry draws it out , and finds it to be a bottle of sack what , is it a time to jest and dally now ?
he throws the bottle at him .
exit well , if percy be alive , i pierce him .
if he do come in my way , so if he do not , if i come in his willingly , let him make a carbonado of me .

i will do so .

come , my lord , i lead you to your tent .
lead me , my lord ?
i do not need your help and god forbid a shallow scratch should drive the prince of wales from such a field as this , where stain nobility lies trodden on , and rebels ' arms triumph in massacres !

exeunt lancaster and westmoreland by god , thou hast deceived me , lancaster , i did not think thee lord of such a spirit before , i loved thee as a brother , john , but now , i do respect thee as my soul .

i have two boys seek percy and thyself about the field but , seeing thou on me so luckily , i will assay thee so , defend thyself .

stay , and breathe awhile thou hast redeem thy lost opinion , and show thou makest some tender of my life , in this fair rescue thou hast brought to me .
o god !
they did me too much injury that ever said i hearken for your death .

my name is harry percy .
why , then i see a very valiant rebel of the name .
i am the prince of wales , and think not , percy , to share with me in glory any more two stars keep not their motion in one sphere , nor can one england brook a double reign , of harry percy and the prince of wales .
nor shall it , harry , for the hour is come to end the one of us , and would to god thy name in arms were now as great as mine !
i make it greater ere i part from thee , and all the budding honours on thy crest i crop , to make a garland for my head .
i can no longer brook thy vanities .

hotspur is wounded , and falls o , harry , thou hast robb me of my youth !
i better brook the loss of brittle life than those proud titles thou hast won of me , they wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh but thought the slave of life , and life time fool , and time , that takes survey of all the world , must have a stop .
o , i could prophesy , but that the earthy and cold hand of death lies on my tongue no , percy , thou art dust and food for dies for worms , brave percy fare thee well , great heart !
ambition , how much art thou shrunk !
when that this body did contain a spirit , a kingdom for it was too small a bound , but now two paces of the vilest earth is room enough this earth that bears thee dead bears not alive so stout a gentleman .
if thou wert sensible of courtesy , i should not make so dear a show of zeal but let my favours hide thy mangled face , and , even in thy behalf , i thank myself for doing these fair rites of tenderness .
adieu , and take thy praise with thee to heaven !
thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave , but not remember in thy epitaph !

could not all this flesh keep in a little life ?
poor jack , farewell !
i could have better spared a better man o , i should have a heavy miss of thee , if i were much in love with vanity !
death hath not struck so fat a deer , though many dearer , in this bloody fray .
embowell will i see thee by and by till then in blood by noble percy lie .

if thou embowel me , i give you leave to powder me and eat me too .

counterfeit ?
i lie , i am no counterfeit to die , is to be a counterfeit , for he is but the counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man but to counterfeit dying , when a man thereby liveth , is to be no counterfeit , but the true and perfect image of life indeed .
the better part of valour is discretion , in the which better part i have saved my life .
, i am afraid of this gunpowder percy , though he be dead how , if he should counterfeit too and rise ?
by my faith , i am afraid he would prove the better counterfeit .
therefore i make him sure , yea , and i swear i killed him .
why may not he rise as well as i ?
nothing confutes me but eyes , and nobody sees me .
therefore , sirrah , stabbing him with a new wound in your thigh , come you along with me .

but , soft !
whom have we here ?
did you not tell me this fat man was dead ?
i did , i saw him dead , breathless and bleeding on the ground .
art thou alive ?
or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight ?
i prithee , speak , we will not trust our eyes without our ears thou art not what thou .
no , that certain , i am not a double man but if i be not jack falstaff , then am i a jack .
there is percy throwing the body down if your father will do me any honour , so , if not , let him kill the next percy himself .
i look to be either earl or duke , i can assure you .
why , percy i killed myself and saw thee dead .
didst thou ?
lord , lord , how this world is given to lying !
i grant you i was down and out of breath , and so was he but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by shrewsbury clock .
if i may be believed , so , if not , let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads .
i take it upon my death , i gave him this wound in the thigh if the man were alive and would deny it , , i would make him eat a piece of my sword .
this is the strangest tale that ever i heard .
this is the strangest fellow , brother john .
come , bring your luggage nobly on your back for my part , if a lie may do thee grace , i gild it with the happiest terms i have .
a retreat is sounded the trumpet sounds retreat , the day is ours .
come , brother , let us to the highest of the field , to see what friends are living , who are dead .
exeunt prince henry and lancaster i follow , as they say , for reward .
he that rewards me , god reward him !
if i do grow great , i grow less , for i purge , and leave sack , and live cleanly as a nobleman should do .
exit scene another part of the field .
the trumpets sound .
enter king henry iv , prince henry , lord john lancaster , earl of westmoreland , with worcester and vernon prisoners thus ever did rebellion find rebuke .
worcester !
did not we send grace , pardon and terms of love to all of you ?
and wouldst thou turn our offers contrary ?
misuse the tenor of thy kinsman trust ?
three knights upon our party slain , a noble earl and many a creature else had been alive this hour , if like a christian thou hadst truly borne betwixt our armies true intelligence .
what i have done my safety urged me to , and i embrace this fortune patiently , since not to be avoided it falls on me .
bear worcester to the death and vernon too other offenders we will pause upon .
exeunt worcester and vernon , guarded how goes the field ?
the noble scot , lord douglas , when he saw the fortune of the day quite turn from him , the noble percy slain , and all his men upon the foot of fear , fled with the rest , and falling from a hill , he was so bruised that the pursuers took him .
at my tent the douglas is , and i beseech your grace i may dispose of him .
with all my heart .
then , brother john of lancaster , to you this honourable bounty shall belong go to the douglas , and deliver him up to his pleasure , ransomless and free his valour shown upon our crests hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds even in the bosom of our adversaries .
i thank your grace for this high courtesy , which i shall give away immediately .
then this remains , that we divide our power .
you , son john , and my cousin westmoreland towards york shall bend you with your dearest speed , to meet northumberland and the prelate scroop , who , as we hear , are busily in arms myself and you , son harry , will towards wales , to fight with glendower and the earl of march .
rebellion in this land shall lose his sway , meeting the cheque of such another day and since this business so fair is done , let us not leave till all our own be won .
exeunt act i scene westminster abbey .
dead march .
enter the funeral of king henry the fifth , attended on by dukes of bedford , regent of france , gloucester , protector , and exeter , earl of warwick , the bishop of winchester , heralds , and c hung be the heavens with black , yield day to night !
comets , importing change of times and states , brandish your crystal tresses in the sky , and with them scourge the bad revolting stars that have consented unto henry death !
king henry the fifth , too famous to live long !
england lost a king of so much worth .
england had a king until his time .
virtue he had , deserving to command his brandish sword did blind men with his beams his arms spread wider than a dragon wings , his sparking eyes , replete with wrathful fire , more dazzled and drove back his enemies than sun fierce bent against their faces .
what should i say ?
his deeds exceed all speech he lift up his hand but conquered .
we mourn in black why mourn we not in blood ?
henry is dead and never shall revive upon a wooden coffin we attend , and death dishonourable victory we with our stately presence glorify , like captives bound to a triumphant car .
what !
shall we curse the planets of mishap that plotted thus our glory overthrow ?
or shall we think the french conjurers and sorcerers , that afraid of him by magic verses have contrived his end ?
bishop he was a king bless of the king of kings .
unto the french the dreadful so dreadful will not be as was his sight .
the battles of the lord of hosts he fought the church prayers made him so prosperous .
the church !
where is it ?
had not churchmen pray , his thread of life had not so soon decay none do you like but an effeminate prince , whom , like a , you may .
bishop gloucester , we like , thou art protector and lookest to command the prince and realm .
thy wife is proud , she holdeth thee in awe , more than god or religious churchmen may .
name not religion , for thou lovest the flesh , and throughout the year to church thou except it be to pray against thy foes .
cease , cease these jars and rest your minds in peace let to the altar heralds , wait on us instead of gold , we offer up our arms since arms avail not now that henry dead .
posterity , await for wretched years , when at their mothers ' moist eyes babes shall suck , our isle be made a nourish of salt tears , and none but women left to wail the dead .
henry the fifth , thy ghost i invocate prosper this realm , keep it from civil broils , combat with adverse planets in the heavens !
a far more glorious star thy soul will make than julius caesar or bright enter a messenger my honourable lords , health to you all !
sad tidings bring i to you out of france , of loss , of slaughter and discomfiture guienne , champagne , rheims , orleans , paris , guysors , poictiers , are all quite lost .
what thou , man , before dead henry corse ?
speak softly , or the loss of those great towns will make him burst his lead and rise from death .
is paris lost ?
is rouen yielded up ?
if henry were recall to life again , these news would cause him once more yield the ghost .
how were they lost ?
what treachery was used ?
no treachery , but want of men and money .
amongst the soldiers this is muttered , that here you maintain several factions , and whilst a field should be dispatch and fought , you are disputing of your generals one would have lingering wars with little cost , another would fly swift , but wanteth wings , a third thinks , without expense at all , by guileful fair words peace may be obtain .
awake , awake , english nobility !
let not sloth dim your horrors cropp are the in your arms , of england coat one half is cut away .
were our tears wanting to this funeral , these tidings would call forth their flowing tides .
me they concern , regent i am of france .
give me my steeled coat .
i fight for france .
away with these disgraceful wailing robes !
wounds will i lend the french instead of eyes , to weep their intermissive miseries .
enter to them another messenger lords , view these letters full of bad mischance .
france is revolted from the english quite , except some petty towns of no import the dauphin charles is crowned king of rheims , the bastard of orleans with him is join , reignier , duke of anjou , doth take his part , the duke of alencon flieth to his side .
the dauphin crowned king !
all fly to him !
o , whither shall we fly from this reproach ?
we will not fly , but to our enemies ' throats .
bedford , if thou be slack , i fight it out .
gloucester , why thou of my forwardness ?
an army have i muster in my thoughts , wherewith already france is overrun .
enter another messenger my gracious lords , to add to your laments , wherewith you now bedew king henry hearse , i must inform you of a dismal fight betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french .
bishop what !
wherein talbot overcame ?
so ?
o , no , wherein lord talbot was the circumstance i tell you more at large .
the tenth of august last this dreadful lord , retiring from the siege of orleans , having full scarce six thousand in his troop .
by three and twenty thousand of the french was round encompassed and set upon .
no leisure had he to enrank his men , he wanted pikes to set before his archers , instead whereof sharp stakes pluck out of hedges they pitched in the ground confusedly , to keep the horsemen off from breaking in .
more than three hours the fight continued , where valiant talbot above human thought enacted wonders with his sword and lance hundreds he sent to hell , and none durst stand him , here , there , and every where , enraged he flew the french exclaim , the devil was in arms , all the whole army stood agazed on him his soldiers spying his undaunted spirit a talbot !
a talbot !
cried out amain and rush into the bowels of the battle .
here had the conquest fully been seal up , if sir john fastolfe had not play the coward he , being in the vaward , placed behind with purpose to relieve and follow them , cowardly fled , not having struck one stroke .
hence grew the general wreck and massacre , enclosed were they with their enemies a base walloon , to win the dauphin grace , thrust talbot with a spear into the back , whom all france with their chief assembled strength durst not presume to look once in the face .
is talbot slain ?
then i will slay myself , for living idly here in pomp and ease , whilst such a worthy leader , wanting aid , unto his dastard foemen is betray .
o no , he lives , but is took prisoner , and lord scales with him and lord hungerford most of the rest slaughter or took likewise .
his ransom there is none but i shall pay i hale the dauphin headlong from his throne his crown shall be the ransom of my friend , four of their lords i change for one of ours .
farewell , my masters , to my task will i , bonfires in france forthwith i am to make , to keep our great saint george feast withal ten thousand soldiers with me i will take , whose bloody deeds shall make all europe quake .
so you had need , for orleans is besieged , the english army is grown weak and faint the earl of salisbury craveth supply , and hardly keeps his men from mutiny , since they , so few , watch such a multitude .
remember , lords , your oaths to henry sworn , either to quell the dauphin utterly , or bring him in obedience to your yoke .
i do remember it , and here take my leave , to go about my preparation .
exit i to the tower with all the haste i can , to view the artillery and munition , and then i will proclaim young henry king .
exit to eltham will i , where the young king is , being ordain his special governor , and for his safety there i best devise .
exit bishop each hath his place and function to attend i am left out , for me nothing remains .
but long i will not be jack out of office the king from eltham i intend to steal and sit at chiefest stern of public weal .
exeunt scene ii .
france .
before orleans .
sound a flourish .
enter charles , alencon , and reignier , marching with drum and soldiers mars his true moving , even as in the heavens so in the earth , to this day is not known late did he shine upon the english side , now we are victors , upon us he smiles .
what towns of any moment but we have ?
at pleasure here we lie near orleans , otherwhiles the famish english , like pale ghosts , faintly besiege us one hour in a month .
they want their porridge and their fat either they must be dieted like mules and have their provender tied to their mouths or piteous they will look , like drowned mice .
let raise the siege why live we idly here ?
talbot is taken , whom we wont to fear remaineth none but salisbury , and he may well in fretting spend his gall , nor men nor money hath he to make war .
sound , sound alarum !
we will rush on them .
now for the honour of the forlorn french !
him i forgive my death that killeth me when he sees me go back one foot or fly .
exeunt here alarum , they are beaten back by the english with great loss .
charles , alencon , and reignier who ever saw the like ?
what men have i !
dogs !
cowards !
dastards !
i would have fled , but that they left me my enemies .
salisbury is a desperate homicide , he fighteth as one weary of his life .
the other lords , like lions wanting food , do rush upon us as their hungry prey .
froissart , a countryman of ours , records , england all olivers and rowlands bred , during the time edward the third did reign .
more truly now may this be verified , for none but samsons and goliases it sendeth forth to skirmish .
one to ten !
lean , rascals !
who would suppose they had such courage and audacity ?
let leave this town , for they are slaves , and hunger will enforce them to be more eager of old i know them , rather with their teeth the walls they tear down than forsake the siege .
i think , by some odd gimmors or device their arms are set like clocks , stiff to strike on , else could they hold out so as they do .
by my consent , we even let them alone .
be it so .
enter the bastard of orleans where the prince dauphin ?
i have news for him .
bastard of orleans , thrice welcome to us .
methinks your looks are sad , your cheer appall hath the late overthrow wrought this offence ?
be not dismay , for succor is at hand a holy maid hither with me i bring , which by a vision sent to her from heaven ordained is to raise this tedious siege and drive the english forth the bounds of france .
the spirit of deep prophecy she hath , exceeding the nine sibyls of old rome what past and what to come she can descry .
speak , shall i call her in ?
believe my words , for they are certain and unfallible .
go , call her in .
exit bastard of orleans but first , to try her skill , reignier , stand thou as dauphin in my place question her proudly , let thy looks be stern by this means shall we sound what skill she hath .
the bastard of orleans , with joan la pucelle fair maid , thou wilt do these wondrous feats ?
reignier , thou that thinkest to beguile me ?
where is the dauphin ?
come , come from behind , i know thee well , though never seen before .
be not amazed , there nothing hid from me in private will i talk with thee apart .
stand back , you lords , and give us leave awhile .
she takes upon her bravely at first dash .
dauphin , i am by birth a shepherd daughter , my wit untrain in any kind of art .
heaven and our lady gracious hath it pleased to shine on my contemptible estate lo , whilst i waited on my tender lambs , and to sun parching heat display my cheeks , god mother deigned to appear to me and in a vision full of majesty will me to leave my base vocation and free my country from calamity her aid she promised and assured success in complete glory she reveal herself , and , whereas i was black and swart before , with those clear rays which she infused on me that beauty am i bless with which you see .
ask me what question thou canst possible , and i will answer unpremeditated my courage try by combat , if thou darest , and thou shalt find that i exceed my sex .
resolve on this , thou shalt be fortunate , if thou receive me for thy warlike mate .
thou hast astonish me with thy high terms only this proof i of thy valour make , in single combat thou shalt buckle with me , and if thou vanquishest , thy words are true , otherwise i renounce all confidence .
i am prepared here is my sword , deck with five on each side , the which at touraine , in saint katharine churchyard , out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth .
then come , o ' god name , i fear no woman .
and while i live , i fly from a man .
here they fight , and joan la pucelle overcomes stay , stay thy hands !
thou art an amazon and fightest with the sword of deborah .
christ mother helps me , else i were too weak .
helps thee , is thou that must help me impatiently i burn with thy desire , my heart and hands thou hast at once subdued .
excellent pucelle , if thy name be so , let me thy servant and not sovereign be is the french dauphin sueth to thee thus .
i must not yield to any rites of love , for my profession sacred from above when i have chased all thy foes from hence , then will i think upon a recompense .
meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall .
my lord , methinks , is very long in talk .
doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock , else could he so long protract his speech .
shall we disturb him , since he keeps no mean ?
he may mean more than we poor men do know these women are shrewd tempters with their tongues .
my lord , where are you ?
what devise you on ?
shall we give over orleans , or no ?
why , no , i say , distrustful recreants !
fight till the last gasp , i will be your guard .
what she says i confirm we fight it out .
assign am i to be the english scourge .
this night the siege assuredly i raise expect saint martin summer , halcyon days , since i have entered into these wars .
glory is like a circle in the water , which never ceaseth to enlarge itself till by broad spreading it disperse to nought .
with henry death the english circle ends , dispersed are the glories it included .
now am i like that proud insulting ship which caesar and his fortune bare at once .
was mahomet inspired with a dove ?
thou with an eagle art inspired then .
helen , the mother of great constantine , nor yet saint philip daughters , were like thee .
bright star of venus , down on the earth , how may i reverently worship thee enough ?
leave off delays , and let us raise the siege .
woman , do what thou canst to save our honours , drive them from orleans and be immortalized .
presently we try come , let away about it no prophet will i trust , if she prove false .

before the tower .
enter gloucester , with his in blue coats i am come to survey the tower this day since henry death , i fear , there is conveyance .
where be these warders , that they wait not here ?

who willed you ?
or whose will stands but mine ?

break up the gates , i be your warrantize .
shall i be flouted thus by dunghill grooms ?
gloucester men rush at the tower gates , and woodvile the lieutenant speaks within what noise is this ?
what traitors have we here ?
lieutenant , is it you whose voice i hear ?
open the gates , here gloucester that would enter .
have patience , noble duke , i may not open , the cardinal of winchester forbids from him i have express commandment that thou nor none of thine shall be let in .
woodvile , prizest him me ?
arrogant winchester , that haughty prelate , whom henry , our late sovereign , could brook ?
thou art no friend to god or to the king open the gates , or i shut thee out shortly .
open the gates unto the lord protector , or we burst them open , if that you come not quickly .
enter to the protector at the tower gates bishop of winchester and his men in tawny coats bishop how now , ambitious humphry !
what means this ?
peel priest , dost thou command me to be shut out ?
bishop i do , thou most usurping proditor , and not protector , of the king or realm .

bishop nay , stand thou back , i will not budge a foot this be damascus , be thou cursed cain , to slay thy brother abel , if thou wilt .
i will not slay thee , but i drive thee back thy scarlet robes as a child i use to carry thee out of this place .
bishop do what thou darest , i beard thee to thy face .

am i dared and bearded to my face ?
draw , men , for all this privileged place , blue coats to tawny coats .
priest , beware your beard , i mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly under my feet i stamp thy cardinal hat in spite of pope or dignities of church , here by the cheeks i drag thee up and down .
bishop gloucester , thou wilt answer this before the pope .
winchester goose , i cry , a rope !
a rope !
now beat them hence , why do you let them stay ?
thee i chase hence , thou wolf in sheep array .
out , tawny coats !

here gloucester men beat out bishop of winchester men , and enter in the burly the mayor of london and his officers fie , lords !
that you , being supreme magistrates , thus contumeliously should break the peace !
peace , mayor !
thou little of my wrongs here beaufort , that regards nor god nor king , hath here distrain the tower to his use .
bishop here gloucester , a foe to citizens , one that still motions war and never peace , your free purses with large fines , that seeks to overthrow religion , because he is protector of the realm , and would have armour here out of the tower , to crown himself king and suppress the prince .
i will not answer thee with words , but blows .
here they skirmish again naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife but to make open proclamation come , officer , as loud as thou canst , cry .
all manner of men assembled here in arms this day against god peace and the king , we charge and command you , in his highness ' name , to repair to your several , and not to wear , handle , or use any sword , weapon , or dagger , henceforward , upon pain of death .
cardinal , i be no breaker of the law but we shall meet , and break our minds at large .
bishop gloucester , we will meet , to thy cost , be sure thy i will have for this day work .
i call for clubs , if you will not away .

enter , on the walls , a master gunner and his boy sirrah , thou how orleans is besieged , and how the english have the suburbs won .
father , i know , and oft have shot at them , unfortunate i miss my aim .
but now thou shalt not .
be thou ruled by me chief am i of this town , something i must do to procure me grace .
the prince espials have informed me how the english , in the suburbs close intrench , wont , through a secret grate of iron bars in yonder tower , to overpeer the city , and thence discover how with most advantage they may vex us with shot , or with assault .
to intercept this inconvenience , a piece of ordnance it i have placed , and even these three days have i watch , if i could see them .
now do thou watch , for i can stay no longer .
if thou any , run and bring me word , and thou shalt find me at the governor .
exit father , i warrant you , take you no care , i never trouble you , if i may spy them .
exit enter , on the turrets , salisbury and talbot , glansdale , gargrave , and others talbot , my life , my joy , again return !
how wert thou handled being prisoner ?
or by what means thou to be released ?
discourse , i prithee , on this turret top .
the duke of bedford had a prisoner call the brave lord ponton de santrailles , for him was i exchanged and ransomed .
but with a baser man of arms by far once in contempt they would have barter me which i , disdaining , scorn , and craved death , rather than i would be so vile esteem .
in fine , redeem i was as i desired .
but , o !
the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart , whom with my bare fists i would execute , if i now had him brought into my power .
yet thou not how thou wert entertain .
with scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts .
in open produced they me , to be a public spectacle to all here , said they , is the terror of the french , the scarecrow that affrights our children so .
then broke i from the officers that led me , and with my nails digg stones out of the ground , to hurl at the beholders of my shame my grisly countenance made others fly , none durst come near for fear of sudden death .
in iron walls they deem me not secure , so great fear of my name them was spread , that they supposed i could rend bars of steel , and spurn in pieces posts of adamant wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had , that walked about me every , and if i did but stir out of my bed , ready they were to shoot me to the heart .
enter the boy with a linstock i grieve to hear what torments you endured , but we will be revenged sufficiently now it is in orleans here , through this grate , i count each one and view the frenchmen how they fortify let us look in , the sight will much delight thee .
sir thomas gargrave , and sir william glansdale , let me have your express opinions where is best place to make our battery next .
i think , at the north gate , for there stand lords .
and i , here , at the bulwark of the bridge .
for aught i see , this city must be famish , or with light skirmishes enfeebled .
here they shoot .
salisbury and gargrave fall o lord , have mercy on us , wretched sinners !
o lord , have mercy on me , woful man !
what chance is this that suddenly hath cross us ?
speak , salisbury , at least , if thou canst speak how farest thou , mirror of all martial men ?
one of thy eyes and thy cheek side struck off !
accursed tower !
accursed fatal hand that hath contrived this woful tragedy !
in thirteen battles salisbury , henry the fifth he first train to the wars , whilst any trump did sound , or drum struck up , his sword did leave striking in the field .
yet livest thou , salisbury ?
though thy speech doth fail , one eye thou hast , to look to heaven for grace the sun with one eye vieweth all the world .
heaven , be thou gracious to none alive , if salisbury wants mercy at thy hands !
bear hence his body , i will help to bury it .
sir thomas gargrave , hast thou any life ?
speak unto talbot , nay , look up to him .
salisbury , cheer thy spirit with this comfort , thou shalt not die whiles he beckons with his hand and smiles on me .
as who should say i am dead and gone , remember to avenge me on the french . '
plantagenet , i will , and like thee , nero , play on the lute , beholding the towns burn wretched shall france be only in my name .
here an alarum , and it thunders and lightens what stir is this ?
what tumult in the heavens ?
whence cometh this alarum and the noise ?

it irks his heart he can not be revenged .
frenchmen , i be a salisbury to you pucelle or puzzel , dolphin or dogfish , your hearts i stamp out with my horse heels , and make a quagmire of your mingled brains .

my breast i burst with straining of my courage and from my shoulders crack my arms asunder .
but i will chastise this strumpet .

a short alarum , then enter the town with soldiers me , if thou canst , i scorn thy strength .
go , go , cheer up thy men , help salisbury to make his testament this day is ours , as many more shall be .
exit my thoughts are whirled like a potter wheel , i know not where i am , nor what i do , a witch , by fear , not force , like hannibal , drives back our troops and conquers as she lists so bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench are from their hives and houses driven away .
they call us for our fierceness english dogs , now , like to whelps , we crying run away .
a short alarum hark , countrymen !
either renew the fight , or tear the lions out of england coat , renounce your soil , give sheep in lions ' stead sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf , or horse or oxen from the leopard , as you fly from your slaves .

of all exploits since first i follow arms , heard i of a warlike enterprise more venturous or desperate than this .
i think this talbot be a fiend of hell .
if not of hell , the heavens , sure , favour him .
here cometh charles i marvel how he sped .
tut , holy joan was his defensive guard .
enter charles and joan la pucelle is this thy cunning , thou deceitful dame ?
didst thou at first , to flatter us withal , make us partakers of a little gain , that now our loss might be ten times so much ?
wherefore is charles impatient with his friend !
at all times will you have my power alike ?
sleeping or waking must i still prevail , or will you blame and lay the fault on me ?
improvident soldiers !
had your watch been good , this sudden mischief never could have .
duke of alencon , this was your default , that , being captain of the watch , did look no better to that weighty charge .
had all your quarters been as safely kept as that whereof i had the government , we had not been thus shamefully surprised .
mine was secure .
and so was mine , my lord .
and , for myself , most part of all this night , within her quarter and mine own precinct i was employ in passing to and fro , about relieving of the sentinels then how or which way should they first break in ?
question , my lords , no further of the case , how or which way is sure they found some place but weakly guarded , where the breach was made .
and now there rests no other shift but this , to gather our soldiers , scatter and dispersed , and lay new platforms to endamage them .
alarum .
enter an english soldier , crying ' a talbot !
a talbot ! '
they fly , leaving their clothes behind i be so bold to take what they have left .
the cry of talbot serves me for a sword , for i have loaden me with many spoils , using no other weapon but his name .
exit scene ii .

enter talbot , bedford , burgundy , a captain , and others the day begins to break , and night is fled , whose pitchy mantle the earth .
here sound retreat , and cease our hot pursuit .
retreat sounded bring forth the body of old salisbury , and here advance it in the , the middle centre of this cursed town .
now have i paid my vow unto his soul , for every drop of blood was drawn from him , there hath at least five frenchmen died tonight .
and that hereafter ages may behold what ruin happen in revenge of him , within their chiefest temple i erect a tomb , wherein his corpse shall be interr upon the which , that every one may read , shall be engraved the sack of orleans , the treacherous manner of his mournful death and what a terror he had been to france .
but , lords , in all our bloody massacre , i muse we met not with the dauphin grace , his champion , virtuous joan of arc , nor any of his false confederates .
is thought , lord talbot , when the fight began , roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds , they did amongst the troops of armed men leap the walls for refuge in the field .
myself , as far as i could well discern for smoke and dusky vapours of the night , am sure i scared the dauphin and his trull , when arm in arm they both came swiftly running , like to a pair of loving that could not live asunder day or night .
after that things are set in order here , we follow them with all the power we have .
enter a messenger all hail , my lords !
which of this princely train call ye the warlike talbot , for his acts so much applauded through the realm of france ?
here is the talbot who would speak with him ?
the virtuous lady , countess of auvergne , with modesty admiring thy renown , by me entreats , great lord , thou wouldst vouchsafe to visit her poor castle where she lies , that she may boast she hath beheld the man whose glory fills the world with loud report .
is it even so ?
nay , then , i see our wars will turn unto a peaceful comic sport , when ladies crave to be encounter with .
you may not , my lord , despise her gentle suit .
trust me then , for when a world of men could not prevail with all their oratory , yet hath a woman kindness and therefore tell her i return great thanks , and in submission will attend on her .
will not your honours bear me company ?
no , truly , it is more than manners will and i have heard it said , unbidden guests are often welcomest when they are gone .
well then , alone , since there no remedy , i mean to prove this lady courtesy .
come hither , captain .
whispers you perceive my mind ?
i do , my lord , and mean accordingly .

madam , i will .
exit countess the plot is laid if all things fall out right , i shall as famous be by this exploit as scythian tomyris by cyrus ' death .
great is the rumor of this dreadful knight , and his achievements of no less account fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears , to give their censure of these rare reports .
enter messenger and talbot madam , according as your ladyship desired , by message craved , so is lord talbot come .
countess and he is welcome .
what !
is this the man ?
madam , it is .
countess is this the scourge of france ?
is this the talbot , so much fear abroad that with his name the mothers still their babes ?
i see report is fabulous and false i thought i should have seen some hercules , a second hector , for his grim aspect , and large proportion of his limbs .
alas , this is a child , a silly dwarf !
it can not be this weak and writhled shrimp should strike such terror to his enemies .
madam , i have been bold to trouble you , but since your ladyship is not at leisure , i sort some other time to visit you .
countess what means he now ?
go ask him whither he goes .
stay , my lord talbot , for my lady craves to know the cause of your abrupt departure .
marry , for that she in a wrong belief , i go to certify her talbot here .
porter with keys countess if thou be he , then art thou prisoner .
prisoner !
to whom ?
countess to me , lord , and for that cause i trained thee to my house .
long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me , for in my gallery thy picture hangs but now the substance shall endure the like , and i will chain these legs and arms of thine , that hast by tyranny these many years wasted our country , slain our citizens and sent our sons and husbands captivate .
ha , ha , ha !
countess laughest thou , wretch ?
thy mirth shall turn to moan .
i laugh to see your ladyship so fond to think that you have aught but talbot shadow whereon to practise your severity .
countess why , art not thou the man ?
i am indeed .
countess then have i substance too .
no , no , i am but shadow of myself you are deceived , my substance is not here , for what you see is but the smallest part and least proportion of humanity i tell you , madam , were the whole frame here , it is of such a spacious lofty pitch , your roof were not sufficient to contai .
countess this is a riddling merchant for the nonce , he will be here , and yet he is not here how can these contrarieties agree ?
that will i show you presently .
winds his horn .
drums strike up a peal of ordnance .
enter soldiers how say you , madam ?
are you now persuaded that talbot is but shadow of himself ?
these are his substance , sinews , arms and strength , with which he yoketh your rebellious necks , razeth your cities and subverts your towns and in a moment makes them desolate .
countess victorious talbot !
pardon my abuse i find thou art no less than fame hath bruited and more than may be gather by thy shape .
let my presumption not provoke thy wrath , for i am sorry that with reverence i did not entertain thee as thou art .
be not dismay , fair lady , nor misconstrue the mind of talbot , as you did mistake the outward composition of his body .
what you have done hath not offended me , nor other satisfaction do i crave , but only , with your patience , that we may taste of your wine and see what cates you have , for soldiers ' stomachs always serve them well .
countess with all my heart , and think me honoured to feast so great a warrior in my house .

enter the earls of somerset , suffolk , and warwick , richard plantagenet , vernon , and another lawyer richard great lords and gentlemen , what means this silence ?
dare no man answer in a case of truth ?
within the we were too loud , the garden here is more convenient .
richard then say at once if i maintain the truth , or else was wrangling somerset in the error ?
faith , i have been a truant in the law , and never yet could frame my will to it , and therefore frame the law unto my will .
judge you , my lord of warwick , then , between us .
between two hawks , which flies the higher pitch , between two dogs , which hath the deeper mouth , between two blades , which bears the better temper between two horses , which doth bear him best , between two girls , which hath the merriest eye , i have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement , but in these nice sharp quillets of the law , good faith , i am no wiser than a daw .
richard tut , tut , here is a mannerly forbearance the truth appears so naked on my side that any purblind eye may find it out .
and on my side it is so well apparell , so clear , so shining and so evident that it will glimmer through a blind man eye .
richard since you are and so loath to speak , in dumb significants proclaim your thoughts let him that is a gentleman and stands upon the honour of his birth , if he suppose that i have pleaded truth , from off this brier pluck a white rose with me .
let him that is no coward nor no flatterer , but dare maintain the party of the truth , pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me .
i love no colours , and without all colour of base insinuating flattery i pluck this white rose with plantagenet .
i pluck this red rose with young somerset and say withal i think he held the right .
stay , lords and gentlemen , and pluck no more , till you conclude that he upon whose side the fewest roses are cropp from the tree shall yield the other in the right opinion .
good master vernon , it is well objected if i have fewest , i subscribe in silence .
richard and i .
then for the truth and plainness of the case .
i pluck this pale and maiden blossom here , giving my verdict on the white rose side .
prick not your finger as you pluck it off , lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red and fall on my side so , against your will .
if i my lord , for my opinion bleed , opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt and keep me on the side where still i am .
well , well , come on who else ?
unless my study and my books be false , the argument you held was wrong in you to somerset in sign whereof i pluck a white rose too .
richard now , somerset , where is your argument ?
here in my scabbard , meditating that shall dye your white rose in a bloody red .
richard meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses , for pale they look with fear , as witnessing the truth on our side .
no , plantagenet , is not for fear but anger that thy cheeks blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses , and yet thy tongue will not confess thy error .
richard hath not thy rose a canker , somerset ?
hath not thy rose a thorn , plantagenet ?
richard ay , sharp and piercing , to maintain his truth , whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood .
well , i find friends to wear my bleeding roses , that shall maintain what i have said is true , where false plantagenet dare not be seen .
richard now , by this maiden blossom in my hand , i scorn thee and thy fashion , peevish boy .
turn not thy scorns this way , plantagenet .
richard proud pole , i will , and scorn both him and thee .
i turn my part thereof into thy throat .
away , away , good william de la pole !
we grace the yeoman by conversing with him .
now , by god will , thou him , somerset , his grandfather was lionel duke of clarence , third son to the third edward king of england spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root ?
richard he bears him on the place privilege , or durst not , for his craven heart , say thus .
by him that made me , i maintain my words on any plot of ground in christendom .
was not thy father , richard earl of cambridge , for treason executed in our late king days ?
and , by his treason , not thou attainted , corrupted , and exempt from ancient gentry ?
his trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood , and , till thou be restored , thou art a yeoman .
richard my father was attached , not attainted , condemn to die for treason , but no traitor , and that i prove on better men than somerset , were growing time once ripen to my will .
for your partaker pole and you yourself , i note you in my book of memory , to scourge you for this apprehension look to it well and say you are well warn .
ah , thou shalt find us ready for thee still , and know us by these colours for thy foes , for these my friends in spite of thee shall wear .
richard and , by my soul , this pale and angry rose , as cognizance of my hate , will i for ever and my faction wear , until it wither with me to my grave or flourish to the height of my degree .
go forward and be choked with thy ambition !
and so farewell until i meet thee next .
exit have with thee , pole .
farewell , ambitious richard .
exit richard how i am braved and must perforce endure it !
this blot that they object against your house shall be wiped out in the next parliament call for the truce of winchester and gloucester , and if thou be not then created york , i will not live to be accounted warwick .
meantime , in signal of my love to thee , against proud somerset and william pole , will i upon thy party wear this rose and here i prophesy this brawl , grown to this faction in the , shall send between the red rose and the white a thousand souls to death and deadly night .
richard good master vernon , i am bound to you , that you on my behalf would pluck a flower .
in your behalf still will i wear the same .
and so will i .
richard thanks , gentle sir .
come , let us four to dinner i dare say this quarrel will drink blood another day .
exeunt scene the tower of london .
enter mortimer , brought in a chair , and gaolers kind keepers of my weak decaying age , let dying mortimer here rest himself .
even like a man new haled from the rack , so fare my limbs with long imprisonment .
and these grey locks , the pursuivants of death , aged in an age of care , argue the end of edmund mortimer .
these eyes , like lamps whose wasting oil is spent , wax dim , as drawing to their exigent , weak shoulders , overborne with burthening grief , and pithless arms , like to a wither vine that droops his sapless branches to the ground , yet are these feet , whose strengthless stay is numb , unable to support this lump of clay , with desire to get a grave , as witting i no other comfort have .
but tell me , keeper , will my nephew come ?
richard plantagenet , my lord , will come we sent unto the temple , unto his chamber , and answer was return that he will come .
enough my soul shall then be satisfied .
poor gentleman !
his wrong doth equal mine .
since henry monmouth first began to reign , before whose glory i was great in arms , this loathsome sequestration have i had and even since then hath richard been obscured , deprived of honour and inheritance .
but now the arbitrator of despairs , just death , kind umpire of men miseries , with sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence i would his troubles likewise were expired , that so he might recover what was lost .
enter richard plantagenet my lord , your loving nephew now is come .
richard plantagenet , my friend , is he come ?
richard ay , noble uncle , thus ignobly used , your nephew , late despised richard , comes .
direct mine arms i may embrace his neck , and in his bosom spend my latter gasp o , tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks , that i may kindly give one fainting kiss .
and now declare , sweet stem from york great stock , why didst thou say , of late thou wert despised ?
richard first , lean thine aged back against mine arm , and , in that ease , i tell thee my disease .
this day , in argument upon a case , some words there grew somerset and me , among which terms he used his lavish tongue and did upbraid me with my father death which obloquy set bars before my tongue , else with the like i had requited him .
therefore , good uncle , for my father sake , in honour of a true plantagenet and for alliance sake , declare the cause my father , earl of cambridge , lost his head .
that cause , fair nephew , that imprison me and hath detain me all my flowering youth within a loathsome dungeon , there to pine , was cursed instrument of his decease .
richard discover more at large what cause that was , for i am ignorant and can not guess .
i will , if that my fading breath permit and death approach not ere my tale be done .
henry the fourth , grandfather to this king , deposed his nephew richard , edward son , the and the lawful heir , of edward king , the third of that descent during whose reign the percies of the north , finding his usurpation most unjust , endeavor my advancement to the throne the reason moved these warlike lords to this was , for that young king richard thus removed , leaving no heir begotten of his body i was the next by birth and parentage , for by my mother i derived am from lionel duke of clarence , the third son to king edward the third , whereas he from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree , being but fourth of that heroic line .
but mark as in this haughty attempt they laboured to plant the rightful heir , i lost my liberty and they their lives .
long after this , when henry the fifth , succeeding his father bolingbroke , did reign , thy father , earl of cambridge , then derived from famous edmund langley , duke of york , marrying my sister that thy mother was , again in pity of my hard distress levied an army , weening to redeem and have install me in the diadem but , as the rest , so fell that noble earl and was beheaded .
thus the mortimers , in whom the tide rested , were suppress .
richard of which , my lord , your honour is the last .
true , and thou seest that i no issue have and that my fainting words do warrant death , thou art my heir , the rest i wish thee gather but yet be wary in thy studious care .
richard thy grave admonishments prevail with me but yet , methinks , my father execution was nothing less than bloody tyranny .
with silence , nephew , be thou politic is the house of lancaster , and like a mountain , not to be removed .
but now thy uncle is removing hence as princes do their courts , when they are cloy with long continuance in a settled place .
richard o , uncle , would some part of my young years might but redeem the passage of your age !
thou dost then wrong me , as that slaughterer doth which giveth many wounds when one will kill .
mourn not , except thou sorrow for my good , only give order for my funeral and so farewell , and fair be all thy hopes and prosperous be thy life in peace and war !
dies richard and peace , no war , befall thy parting soul !
in prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage and like a hermit overpass thy days .
well , i will lock his counsel in my breast , and what i do imagine let that rest .
keepers , convey him hence , and i myself will see his burial better than his life .
exeunt gaolers , bearing out the body of mortimer here dies the dusky torch of mortimer , choked with ambition of the meaner sort and for those wrongs , those bitter injuries , which somerset hath offer to my house i doubt not but with honour to redress , and therefore haste i to the parliament , either to be restored to my blood , or make my ill the advantage of my good .

if thou canst accuse , or aught to lay unto my charge , do it without invention , suddenly , as i with sudden and extemporal speech purpose to answer what thou canst object .
presumptuous priest !
this place commands my patience , or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour me .
think not , although in writing i preferr the manner of thy vile outrageous crimes , that therefore i have forged , or am not able verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen no , prelate , such is thy audacious wickedness , thy lewd , pestiferous and dissentious pranks , as very infants prattle of thy pride .
thou art a most pernicious usurer , forward by nature , enemy to peace , lascivious , wanton , more than well beseems a man of thy profession and degree , and for thy treachery , what more manifest ?
in that thou a trap to take my life , as well at london bridge as at the tower .
beside , i fear me , if thy thoughts were sifted , the king , thy sovereign , is not quite exempt from envious malice of thy swelling heart .
bishop gloucester , i do defy thee .
lords , vouchsafe to give me hearing what i shall reply .
if i were covetous , ambitious or perverse , as he will have me , how am i so poor ?
or how haps it i seek not to advance or raise myself , but keep my wonted calling ?
and for dissension , who preferreth peace more than i do ? except i be provoked .
no , my good lords , it is not that offends , it is not that that hath incensed the duke it is , because no one should sway but he , no one but he should be about the king , and that engenders thunder in his breast and makes him roar these accusations forth .
but he shall know i am as good as good !
thou bastard of my grandfather !
bishop ay , lordly sir , for what are you , i pray , but one imperious in another throne ?
am i not protector , saucy priest ?
bishop and am not i a prelate of the church ?
yes , as an outlaw in a castle keeps and useth it to patronage his theft .
bishop unreverent gloster !
thou art reverent touching thy spiritual function , not thy life .
bishop rome shall remedy this .
roam thither , then .
my lord , it were your duty to forbear .
ay , see the bishop be not overborne .
methinks my lord should be religious and know the office that belongs to such .
methinks his lordship should be humbler , it fitteth not a prelate so to plead .
yes , when his holy state is touch so near .
state holy or unhallow , what of that ?
is not his grace protector to the king ?
richard aside plantagenet , i see , must hold his tongue , lest it be said , sirrah , when you should , must your bold verdict enter talk with lords ? '
else would i have a fling at winchester .
uncles of gloucester and of winchester , the special watchmen of our english weal , i would prevail , if prayers might prevail , to join your hearts in love and amity .
o , what a scandal is it to our crown , that two such noble peers as ye should jar !
believe me , lords , my tender years can tell civil dissension is a viperous worm that gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth .

enter mayor o , my good lords , and virtuous henry , pity the city of london , pity us !
the bishop and the duke of gloucester men , forbidden late to carry any weapon , have fill their pockets full of pebble stones and banding themselves in contrary parts do pelt so fast at one another pate that many have their giddy brains knock out our windows are broke down in every street and we for fear compell to shut our shops .
enter , in skirmish , with bloody pates we charge you , on allegiance to ourself , to hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace .
pray , uncle gloucester , mitigate this strife .
first nay , if we be forbidden stones , we fall to it with our teeth .
second do what ye dare , we are as resolute .
skirmish again you of my household , leave this peevish broil and set this unaccustom fight aside .
third my lord , we know your grace to be a man just and upright , and , for your royal birth , inferior to none but to his majesty and ere that we will suffer such a prince , so kind a father of the commonweal , to be disgraced by an inkhorn mate , we and our wives and children all will fight and have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes .
first ay , and the very parings of our nails shall pitch a field when we are dead .
begin again stay , stay , i say !
and if you love me , as you say you do , let me persuade you to forbear awhile .
o , how this discord doth afflict my soul !
can you , my lord of winchester , behold my sighs and tears and will not once relent ?
who should be pitiful , if you be not ?
or who should study to prefer a peace .
if holy churchmen take delight in broils ?
yield , my lord protector , yield , winchester , except you mean with obstinate repulse to slay your sovereign and destroy the realm .
you see what mischief and what murder too hath been enacted through your enmity , then be at peace except ye thirst for blood .
bishop he shall submit , or i will never yield .
compassion on the king commands me stoop , or i would see his heart out , ere the priest should ever get that privilege of me .
behold , my lord of winchester , the duke hath banish moody discontented fury , as by his smoothed brows it doth appear why look you still so stern and tragical ?
here , winchester , i offer thee my hand .
fie , uncle beaufort !
i have heard you preach that malice was a great and grievous sin , and will not you maintain the thing you teach , but prove a chief offender in the same ?
sweet king !
the bishop hath a kindly gird .
for shame , my lord of winchester , relent !
what , shall a child instruct you what to do ?
bishop well , duke of gloucester , i will yield to thee , love for thy love and hand for hand i give .
aside ay , but , i fear me , with a hollow see here , my friends and loving countrymen , this token serveth for a flag of truce betwixt ourselves and all our followers so help me god , as i dissemble not !
bishop aside so help me god , as i intend it not !
o , loving uncle , kind duke of gloucester , how joyful am i made by this contract !
away , my masters !
trouble us no more , but join in friendship , as your lords have done .
first content i to the surgeon .
second and so will i .
third and i will see what physic the tavern affords .
exeunt , mayor , and c accept this scroll , most gracious sovereign , which in the right of richard plantagenet we do exhibit to your majesty .
well urged , my lord of warwick or sweet prince , and if your grace mark every circumstance , you have great reason to do richard right , especially for those occasions at eltham place i told your majesty .
and those occasions , uncle , were of force therefore , my loving lords , our pleasure is that richard be restored to his blood .
let richard be restored to his blood , so shall his father wrongs be recompensed .
bishop as will the rest , so willeth winchester .
if richard will be true , not that alone but all the whole inheritance i give that doth belong unto the house of york , from whence you spring by lineal descent .
richard thy humble servant vows obedience and humble service till the point of death .
stoop then and set your knee against my foot , and , in reguerdon of that duty done , i gird thee with the valiant sword of york rise richard , like a true plantagenet , and rise created princely duke of york .
richard and so thrive richard as thy foes may fall !
and as my duty springs , so perish they that grudge one thought against your majesty !
welcome , high prince , the mighty duke of york !
aside perish , base prince , ignoble duke of york !
now will it best avail your majesty to cross the seas and to be crown in france the presence of a king engenders love amongst his subjects and his loyal friends , as it disanimates his enemies .

this late dissension grown betwixt the peers burns under feigned ashes of forged love and will at last break out into a flame as fester members rot but by degree , till bones and flesh and sinews fall away , so will this base and envious discord breed .
and now i fear that fatal prophecy which in the time of henry named the fifth was in the mouth of every sucking babe , that henry born at monmouth should win all and henry born at windsor lose all which is so plain that exeter doth wish his days may finish ere that hapless time .

lord talbot , do not so dishonour me here will i sit before the walls of rouen and will be partner of your weal or woe .
courageous bedford , let us now persuade you .
not to be gone from hence , for once i read that stout pendragon in his litter sick came to the field and vanquished his foes methinks i should revive the soldiers ' hearts , because i ever found them as myself .
undaunted spirit in a dying breast !
then be it so heavens keep old bedford safe !
and now no more ado , brave burgundy , but gather we our forces out of hand and set upon our boasting enemy .
exeunt all but bedford and attendants an alarum excursions .
enter fastolfe and a captain whither away , sir john fastolfe , in such haste ?
whither away !
to save myself by flight we are like to have the overthrow again .
what !
will you fly , and leave lord talbot ?
ay , all the talbots in the world , to save my life !
exit cowardly knight !
ill fortune follow thee !
exit retreat excursions .
joan la pucelle , alencon , and charles fly now , quiet soul , depart when heaven please , for i have seen our enemies ' overthrow .
what is the trust or strength of foolish man ?
they that of late were daring with their scoffs are glad and fain by flight to save themselves .
bedford dies , and is carried in by two in his chair an alarum .
talbot , burgundy , and the rest lost , and recover in a day again !
this is a double honour , burgundy yet heavens have glory for this victory !
warlike and martial talbot , burgundy enshrines thee in his heart and there erects thy noble deeds as valour monuments .
thanks , gentle duke .
but where is pucelle now ?
i think her old familiar is asleep now where the bastard braves , and charles his gleeks ?
what , all amort ?
rouen hangs her head for grief that such a valiant company are fled .
now will we take some order in the town , placing therein some expert officers , and then depart to paris to the king , for there young henry with his nobles lie .
what wills lord talbot pleaseth burgundy .
but yet , before we go , let not forget the noble duke of bedford late deceased , but see his exequies fulfill in rouen a braver soldier never couched lance , a gentler heart did never sway in court , but kings and mightiest potentates must die , for that the end of human misery .
exeunt scene iii .
the plains near rouen .
enter charles , the bastard of orleans , alencon , joan la pucelle , and forces dismay not , princes , at this accident , nor grieve that rouen is so recovered care is no cure , but rather corrosive , for things that are not to be remedied .
let frantic talbot triumph for a while and like a peacock sweep along his tail , we pull his plumes and take away his train , if dauphin and the rest will be but ruled .
we have been guided by thee hitherto , and of thy cunning had no diffidence one sudden foil shall never breed distrust .
search out thy wit for secret policies , and we will make thee famous through the world .
we set thy statue in some holy place , and have thee reverenced like a blessed saint employ thee then , sweet virgin , for our good .
then thus it must be , this doth joan devise by fair persuasions mix with sugar words we will entice the duke of burgundy to leave the talbot and to follow us .
ay , marry , sweeting , if we could do that , france were no place for henry warriors , nor should that nation boast it so with us , but be extirped from our provinces .
for ever should they be expulsed from france and not have title of an earldom here .
your honours shall perceive how i will work to bring this matter to the wished end .
drum sounds afar off hark !
by the sound of drum you may perceive their powers are marching unto .
here sound an english march .
enter , and pass over at a distance , talbot and his forces there goes the talbot , with his colours spread , and all the troops of english after him .
french march .
enter burgundy and forces now in the rearward comes the duke and his fortune in favour makes him lag behind .
summon a parley , we will talk with him .
trumpets sound a parley a parley with the duke of burgundy !
who craves a parley with the burgundy ?
the princely charles of france , thy countryman .
what thou , charles ?
for i am marching hence .
speak , pucelle , and enchant him with thy words .
brave burgundy , undoubted hope of france !
stay , let thy humble handmaid speak to thee .
speak on , but be not .
look on thy country , look on fertile france , and see the cities and the towns defaced by wasting ruin of the cruel foe .
as looks the mother on her lowly babe when death doth close his tender dying eyes , see , see the pining malady of france , behold the wounds , the most unnatural wounds , which thou thyself hast given her woful breast .
o , turn thy edged sword another way , strike those that hurt , and hurt not those that help .
one drop of blood drawn from thy country bosom should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore return thee therefore with a flood of tears , and wash away thy country stained spots .
either she hath bewitch me with her words , or nature makes me suddenly relent .
besides , all french and france exclaims on thee , doubting thy birth and lawful progeny .
who thou with but with a lordly nation that will not trust thee but for profit sake ?
when talbot hath set footing once in france and fashion thee that instrument of ill , who then but english henry will be lord and thou be thrust out like a fugitive ?
call we to mind , and mark but this for proof , was not the duke of orleans thy foe ?
and was he not in england prisoner ?
but when they heard he was thine enemy , they set him free without his ransom paid , in spite of burgundy and all his friends .
see , then , thou against thy countrymen and with them will be thy slaughtermen .
come , come , return , return , thou wandering lord charles and the rest will take thee in their arms .
i am vanquished , these haughty words of hers have batter me like roaring , and made me almost yield upon my knees .
forgive me , country , and sweet countrymen , and , lords , accept this hearty kind embrace my forces and my power of men are yours so farewell , talbot , i no longer trust thee .
aside done like a frenchman turn , and turn again !
welcome , brave duke !
thy friendship makes us fresh .
and doth beget new courage in our breasts .
pucelle hath bravely play her part in this , and doth deserve a coronet of gold .
now let us on , my lords , and join our powers , and seek how we may prejudice the foe .

kneels is this the lord talbot , uncle gloucester , that hath so long been resident in france ?
yes , if it please your majesty , my liege .
welcome , brave captain and victorious lord !
when i was young , as yet i am not old , i do remember how my father said a stouter champion never handled sword .
long since we were resolved of your truth , your faithful service and your toil in war , yet never have you tasted our reward , or been reguerdon with so much as thanks , because till now we never saw your face therefore , stand up , and , for these good deserts , we here create you earl of shrewsbury , and in our coronation take your place .

sirrah , thy lord i honour as he is .
why , what is he ?
as good a man as york .
hark ye , not so in witness , take ye that .
strikes him villain , thou the law of arms is such that whoso draws a sword , is present death , or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood .

now , governor of paris , take your oath , that you elect no other king but him , esteem none friends but such as are his friends , and none your foes but such as shall pretend malicious practises against his state this shall ye do , so help you righteous god !
enter fastolfe my gracious sovereign , as i rode from calais , to haste unto your coronation , a letter was deliver to my hands , writ to your grace from the duke of burgundy .
shame to the duke of burgundy and thee !
i vow , base knight , when i did meet thee next , to tear the garter from thy craven leg , plucking it off which i have done , because unworthily thou wast installed in that high degree .
pardon me , princely henry , and the rest this dastard , at the battle of patay , when but in all i was six thousand strong and that the french were almost ten to one , before we met or that a stroke was given , like to a trusty squire did run away in which assault we lost twelve hundred men , myself and divers gentlemen beside were there surprised and taken prisoners .
then judge , great lords , if i have done amiss , or whether that such cowards ought to wear this ornament of knighthood , yea or no .
to say the truth , this fact was infamous and ill beseeming any common man , much more a knight , a captain and a leader .
when first this order was ordain , my lords , knights of the garter were of noble birth , valiant and virtuous , full of haughty courage , such as were grown to credit by the wars , not fearing death , nor shrinking for distress , but always resolute in most extremes .
he then that is not furnish in this sort doth but usurp the sacred name of knight , profaning this most honourable order , and should , if i were worthy to be judge , be quite degraded , like a swain that doth presume to boast of gentle blood .
stain to thy countrymen , thou thy doom !
be packing , therefore , thou that wast a knight henceforth we banish thee , on pain of death .
exit fastolfe and now , my lord protector , view the letter sent from our uncle duke of burgundy .
what means his grace , that he hath changed his style ?
no more but , plain and bluntly , the king ! '
hath he forgot he is his sovereign ?
or doth this churlish superscription pretend some alteration in good will ?
what here ?
reads ' i have , upon especial cause , moved with compassion of my country wreck , together with the pitiful complaints of such as your oppression feeds upon , forsaken your pernicious faction and join with charles , the rightful king of france . '
o monstrous treachery !
can this be so , that in alliance , amity and oaths , there should be found such false dissembling guile ?
what !
doth my uncle burgundy revolt ?
he doth , my lord , and is become your foe .
is that the worst this letter doth contain ?
it is the worst , and all , my lord , he writes .
why , then , lord talbot there shall talk with him and give him chastisement for this abuse .
how say you , my lord ?
are you not content ?
content , my liege !
yes , but that i am prevented , i should have begg i might have been employ .
then gather strength and march unto him straight let him perceive how ill we brook his treason and what offence it is to flout his friends .
i go , my lord , in heart desiring still you may behold confusion of your foes .
exit enter vernon and basset grant me the combat , gracious sovereign .
and me , my lord , grant me the combat too .
this is my servant hear him , noble prince .
and this is mine sweet henry , favour him .
be patient , lords , and give them leave to speak .
say , gentlemen , what makes you thus exclaim ?
and wherefore crave you combat ?
or with whom ?
with him , my lord , for he hath done me wrong .
and i with him , for he hath done me wrong .
what is that wrong whereof you both complain ?
first let me know , and then i answer you .
crossing the sea from england into france , this fellow here , with envious carping tongue , upbraided me about the rose i wear , saying , the sanguine colour of the leaves did represent my master blushing cheeks , when stubbornly he did repugn the truth about a certain question in the law argued betwixt the duke of york and him , with other vile and ignominious terms in confutation of which rude reproach and in defence of my lord worthiness , i crave the benefit of law of arms .
and that is my petition , noble lord for though he seem with forged quaint conceit to set a gloss upon his bold intent , yet know , my lord , i was provoked by him , and he first took exceptions at this badge , pronouncing that the paleness of this flower bewray the faintness of my master heart .
will not this malice , somerset , be left ?
your private grudge , my lord of york , will out , though so cunningly you smother it .
good lord , what madness rules in brainsick men , when for so slight and frivolous a cause such factious emulations shall arise !
good cousins both , of york and somerset , quiet yourselves , i pray , and be at peace .
let this dissension first be tried by fight , and then your highness shall command a peace .
the quarrel toucheth none but us alone , betwixt ourselves let us decide it then .
there is my pledge , accept it , somerset .
nay , let it rest where it began at first .
confirm it so , mine honourable lord .
confirm it so !
confounded be your strife !
and perish ye , with your audacious prate !
presumptuous vassals , are you not ashamed with this immodest clamorous outrage to trouble and disturb the king and us ?
and you , my lords , methinks you do not well to bear with their perverse objections , much less to take occasion from their mouths to raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves let me persuade you take a better course .
it grieves his highness good my lords , be friends .
come hither , you that would be combatants henceforth i charge you , as you love our favour , quite to forget this quarrel and the cause .
and you , my lords , remember where we are , in france , amongst a fickle wavering nation if they perceive dissension in our looks and that within ourselves we disagree , how will their grudging stomachs be provoked to wilful disobedience , and rebel !
beside , what infamy will there arise , when foreign princes shall be certified that for a toy , a thing of no regard , king henry peers and chief nobility destroy themselves , and lost the realm of france !
o , think upon the conquest of my father , my tender years , and let us not forego that for a trifle that was bought with blood let me be umpire in this doubtful strife .
i see no reason , if i wear this rose , putting on a red rose that any one should therefore be suspicious i more incline to somerset than york both are my kinsmen , and i love them both as well they may upbraid me with my crown , because , forsooth , the king of scots is crown .
but your discretions better can persuade than i am able to instruct or teach and therefore , as we hither came in peace , so let us still continue peace and love .
cousin of york , we institute your grace to be our regent in these parts of france and , good my lord of somerset , unite your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot , and , like true subjects , sons of your progenitors , go cheerfully together and digest .
your angry choler on your enemies .
ourself , my lord protector and the rest after some respite will return to calais , from thence to england , where i hope ere long to be presented , by your victories , with charles , alencon and that traitorous rout .
flourish .
exeunt all but york , warwick , exeter and vernon my lord of york , i promise you , the king prettily , methought , did play the orator .
and so he did , but yet i like it not , in that he wears the badge of somerset .
tush , that was but his fancy , blame him not , i dare presume , sweet prince , he thought no harm .
an if i wist he did , but let it rest , other affairs must now be managed .
exeunt all but exeter well didst thou , richard , to suppress thy voice , for , had the passions of thy heart burst out , i fear we should have seen decipher there more rancorous spite , more furious raging broils , than yet can be imagined or supposed .
but , no simple man that sees this jarring discord of nobility , this shouldering of each other in the court , this factious bandying of their favourites , but that it doth presage some ill event .
is much when sceptres are in children hands , but more when envy breeds unkind division , there comes the rain , there begins confusion .

thou ominous and fearful owl of death , our nation terror and their bloody scourge !
the period of thy tyranny approacheth .
on us thou canst not enter but by death , for , i protest , we are well fortified and strong enough to issue out and fight if thou retire , the dauphin , well appointed , stands with the snares of war to tangle thee on either hand thee there are squadrons pitch , to wall thee from the liberty of flight , and no way canst thou turn thee for redress , but death doth front thee with apparent spoil and pale destruction meets thee in the face .
ten thousand french have the sacrament to rive their dangerous artillery upon no christian soul but english talbot .
lo , there thou , a breathing valiant man , of an invincible unconquer spirit !

how are we park and bounded in a pale , a little herd of england timorous deer , mazed with a yelping kennel of french curs !
if we be english deer , be then in blood , not , to fall down with a pinch , but rather , and desperate stags , turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel and make the cowards stand aloof at bay sell every man his life as dear as mine , and they shall find dear deer of us , my friends .

a plague upon that villain somerset , that thus delays my promised supply of horsemen , that were levied for this siege !
renowned talbot doth expect my aid , and i am lowted by a traitor villain and can not help the noble chevalier god comfort him in this necessity !

else , farewell talbot , france , and england honour .
o god , that somerset , who in proud heart doth stop my cornets , were in talbot place !
so should we save a valiant gentleman by forfeiting a traitor and a coward .
mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep , that thus we die , while remiss traitors sleep .
o , send some succor to the distress lord !
he dies , we lose , i break my warlike word , we mourn , france smiles , we lose , they daily get , all of this vile traitor somerset .
then god take mercy on brave talbot soul , and on his son young john , who two hours since i met in travel toward his warlike father !
this seven years did not talbot see his son , and now they meet where both their lives are done .
alas , what joy shall noble talbot have to bid his young son welcome to his grave ?
away !
vexation almost stops my breath , that sunder friends greet in the hour of death .
lucy , farewell , no more my fortune can , but curse the cause i can not aid the man .
maine , blois , poictiers , and tours , are won away , all of somerset and his delay .

here is sir william lucy , who with me set from our forces forth for aid .
enter sir william lucy how now , sir william !
whither were you sent ?
whither , my lord ?
from bought and sold lord talbot , who , ring about with bold adversity , cries out for noble york and somerset , to beat assailing death from his weak legions and whiles the honourable captain there drops bloody sweat from his limbs , and , in advantage lingering , looks for rescue , you , his false hopes , the trust of england honour , keep off aloof with worthless emulation .
let not your private discord keep away the levied succors that should lend him aid , while he , renowned noble gentleman , yields up his life unto a world of odds orleans the bastard , charles , burgundy , alencon , reignier , compass him about , and talbot perisheth by your default .
york set him on , york should have sent him aid .
and york as fast upon your grace exclaims , swearing that you withhold his levied host , collected for this expedition .
york lies , he might have sent and had the horse , i owe him little duty , and less love , and take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending .
the fraud of england , not the force of france , hath now entrapp the talbot never to england shall he bear his life , but dies , betray to fortune by your strife .
come , go , i will dispatch the horsemen straight within six hours they will be at his aid .
too late comes rescue he is or slain , for fly he could not , if he would have fled , and fly would talbot never , though he might .
if he be dead , brave talbot , then adieu !
his fame lives in the world , his shame in you .
exeunt scene the english camp near bourdeaux .

i did send for thee to tutor thee in stratagems of war , that talbot name might be in thee revived when sapless age and weak unable limbs should bring thy father to his drooping chair .
but , o malignant and stars !
now thou art come unto a feast of death , a terrible and unavoided danger therefore , dear boy , mount on my swiftest horse , and i direct thee how thou shalt escape by sudden flight come , dally not , be gone .
is my name talbot ?
and am i your son ?
and shall i fly ?
o if you love my mother , dishonour not her honourable name , to make a bastard and a slave of me !
the world will say , he is not talbot blood , that basely fled when noble talbot stood .
fly , to revenge my death , if i be slain .
he that flies so will return again .
if we both stay , we both are sure to die .
then let me stay , and , father , do you fly your loss is great , so your regard should be , my worth unknown , no loss is known in me .
upon my death the french can little boast , in yours they will , in you all hopes are lost .
flight can not stain the honour you have won , but mine it will , that no exploit have done you fled for vantage , everyone will swear , but , if i bow , they say it was for fear .
there is no hope that ever i will stay , if the first hour i shrink and run away .
here on my knee i beg mortality , rather than life preserved with infamy .
shall all thy mother hopes lie in one tomb ?
ay , rather than i shame my mother womb .
upon my blessing , i command thee go .
to fight i will , but not to fly the foe .
part of thy father may be saved in thee .
no part of him but will be shame in me .
thou never hadst renown , nor canst not lose it .
yes , your renowned name shall flight abuse it ?
thy father charge shall clear thee from that stain .
you can not witness for me , being slain .
if death be so apparent , then both fly .
and leave my followers here to fight and die ?
my age was never tainted with such shame .
and shall my youth be guilty of such blame ?
no more can i be sever from your side , than can yourself yourself in twain divide stay , go , do what you will , the like do i , for live i will not , if my father die .
then here i take my leave of thee , fair son , born to eclipse thy life this afternoon .
come , side by side together live and die .
and soul with soul from france to heaven fly .

the regent hath with talbot broke his word and left us to the rage of france his sword .
where is john talbot ?
pause , and take thy breath , i gave thee life and rescued thee from death .
o , twice my father , twice am i thy son !
the life thou gavest me first was lost and done , till with thy warlike sword , despite of late , to my determined time thou gavest new date .
when from the dauphin crest thy sword struck fire , it warm thy father heart with proud desire of victory .
then leaden age , quicken with youthful spleen and warlike rage , beat down alencon , orleans , burgundy , and from the pride of gallia rescued thee .
the ireful bastard orleans , that drew blood from thee , my boy , and had the maidenhood of thy first fight , i soon encountered , and interchanging blows i quickly shed some of his bastard blood , and in disgrace bespoke him thus , , base and misbegotten blood i spill of thine , mean and right poor , for that pure blood of mine which thou didst force from talbot , my brave boy ' here , purposing the bastard to destroy , came in strong rescue .
speak , thy father care , art thou not weary , john ?
how dost thou fare ?
wilt thou yet leave the battle , boy , and fly , now thou art seal the son of chivalry ?
fly , to revenge my death when i am dead the help of one stands me in little stead .
o , too much folly is it , well i wot , to hazard all our lives in one small boat !
if i die not with frenchmen rage , i shall die with mickle age by me they nothing gain an if i stay , is but the shortening of my life one day in thee thy mother dies , our household name , my death revenge , thy youth , and england fame all these and more we hazard by thy stay , all these are saved if thou wilt fly away .
the sword of orleans hath not made me smart , these words of yours draw from my heart on that advantage , bought with such a shame , to save a paltry life and slay bright fame , before young talbot from old talbot fly , the coward horse that bears me fail and die !
and like me to the peasant boys of france , to be shame scorn and subject of mischance !
surely , by all the glory you have won , an if i fly , i am not talbot son then talk no more of flight , it is no boot , if son to talbot , die at talbot foot .
then follow thou thy desperate sire of crete , thou icarus , thy life to me is sweet if thou wilt fight , fight by thy father side , and , commendable proved , let die in pride .

where is valiant john ?
triumphant death , smear with captivity , young talbot valour makes me smile at thee when he perceived me shrink and on my knee , his bloody sword he brandish over me , and , like a hungry lion , did commence rough deeds of rage and stern impatience , but when my angry guardant stood alone , tendering my ruin and assail of none , fury and great rage of heart suddenly made him from my side to start into the clustering battle of the french , and in that sea of blood my boy did drench his spirit , and there died , my icarus , my blossom , in his pride .
o , my dear lord , lo , where your son is borne !
enter soldiers , with the body of john talbot thou antic death , which us here to scorn , anon , from thy insulting tyranny , coupled in bonds of perpetuity , two talbots , winged through the lither sky , in thy despite shall mortality .
o , thou , whose wounds become death , speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath !
brave death by speaking , whether he will or no , imagine him a frenchman and thy foe .
poor boy !
he smiles , methinks , as who should say , had death been french , then death had died .
come , come and lay him in his father arms my spirit can no longer bear these harms .
soldiers , adieu !

how the young whelp of talbot , , did flesh his puny sword in frenchmen blood !
once i encounter him , and thus i said maiden youth , be vanquish by a maid ' but , with a proud majestical high scorn , he answer thus talbot was not born to be the pillage of a giglot wench ' so , rushing in the bowels of the french , he left me proudly , as unworthy fight .
doubtless he would have made a noble knight , see , where he lies inhearsed in the arms of the most bloody nurser of his harms !
hew them to pieces , hack their bones asunder whose life was england glory , gallia wonder .
o , no , forbear !
for that which we have fled during the life , let us not wrong it dead .
enter sir william lucy , attended , herald of the french preceding herald , conduct me to the dauphin tent , to know who hath obtained the glory of the day .

i come to know what prisoners thou hast and to survey the bodies of the dead .
for prisoners thou ?
hell our prison is .
but tell me whom thou .

go , take their bodies hence .

who art thou ?
say , that i may honour thee .
margaret my name , and daughter to a king , the king of naples , thou art .
an earl i am , and suffolk am i call .
be not offended , nature miracle , thou art allotted to be by me so doth the swan her downy cygnets save , keeping them prisoner underneath her wings .
yet , if this servile usage once offend .
go , and be free again , as suffolk friend .
she is going o , stay !
i have no power to let her pass , my hand would free her , but my heart says no as plays the sun upon the glassy streams , twinkling another counterfeited beam , so seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes .
fain would i woo her , yet i dare not speak i call for pen and ink , and write my mind .
fie , de la pole !
disable not thyself , hast not a tongue ?
is she not here ?
wilt thou be daunted at a woman sight ?
ay , beauty princely majesty is such , confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough .
say , earl of suffolk if thy name be so what ransom must i pay before i pass ?
for i perceive i am thy prisoner .
how canst thou tell she will deny thy suit , before thou make a trial of her love ?
why thou not ?
what ransom must i pay ?
she beautiful , and therefore to be woo , she is a woman , therefore to be won .
wilt thou accept of ransom ?
yea , or no .
fond man , remember that thou hast a wife , then how can margaret be thy paramour ?
i were best to leave him , for he will not hear .
there all is marr , there lies a cooling card .
he talks at random , sure , the man is mad .
and yet a dispensation may be had .
and yet i would that you would answer me .
i win this lady margaret .
for whom ?
why , for my king tush , that a wooden thing !
he talks of wood it is some carpenter .
yet so my fancy may be satisfied , and peace established between these realms but there remains a scruple in that too , for though her father be the king of naples , duke of anjou and maine , yet is he poor , and our nobility will scorn the match .
hear ye , captain , are you not at leisure ?
it shall be so , disdain they so much .
henry is youthful and will quickly yield .
madam , i have a secret to reveal .
what though i be enthrall ?
he seems a knight , and will not any way dishonour me .
lady , vouchsafe to listen what i say .
perhaps i shall be rescued by the french , and then i need not crave his courtesy .
sweet madam , give me a hearing in a cause tush , women have been captivate ere now .
lady , wherefore talk you so ?
i cry you mercy , is but quid for quo .
say , gentle princess , would you not suppose your bondage happy , to be made a queen ?
to be a queen in bondage is more vile than is a slave in base servility , for princes should be free .
and so shall you , if happy england royal king be free .
why , what concerns his freedom unto me ?
i undertake to make thee henry queen , to put a golden sceptre in thy hand and set a precious crown upon thy head , if thou wilt condescend to be my what ?
his love .
i am unworthy to be henry wife .
no , gentle madam , i unworthy am to woo so fair a dame to be his wife , and have no portion in the choice myself .
how say you , madam , are ye so content ?
an if my father please , i am content .
then call our captains and our colours forth .

i am a soldier , and unapt to weep , or to exclaim on fortune fickleness .
yes , there is remedy enough , my lord consent , and for thy honour give consent , thy daughter shall be wedded to my king , whom i with pain have woo and won thereto , and this her imprisonment hath gained thy daughter princely liberty .
speaks suffolk as he thinks ?
fair margaret knows that suffolk doth not flatter , face , or feign .
upon thy princely warrant , i descend to give thee answer of thy just demand .
exit from the walls and here i will expect thy coming .
trumpets sound .
enter reignier , below welcome , brave earl , into our territories command in anjou what your honour pleases .

since thou dost deign to woo her little worth to be the princely bride of such a lord , upon condition i may quietly enjoy mine own , the country maine and anjou , free from oppression or the stroke of war , my daughter shall be henry , if he please .
that is her ransom , i deliver her , and those two counties i will undertake your grace shall well and quietly enjoy .
and i again , in henry royal name , as deputy unto that gracious king , give thee her hand , for sign of plighted faith .
reignier of france , i give thee kingly thanks , because this is in traffic of a king .

i over then to england with this news , and make this marriage to be solemnized .
so farewell , reignier set this diamond safe in golden palaces , as it becomes .
i do embrace thee , as i would embrace the christian prince , king henry , were he here .
farewell , my lord good wishes , praise and prayers shall suffolk ever have of margaret .
going farewell , sweet madam but hark you , margaret , no princely commendations to my king ?
such commendations as becomes a maid , a virgin and his servant , say to him .
words sweetly placed and modestly directed .
but madam , i must trouble you again , no loving token to his majesty ?
yes , my good lord , a pure unspotted heart , never yet taint with love , i send the king .
and this withal .
kisses her that for thyself i will not so presume to send such peevish tokens to a king .
exeunt reignier and margaret o , wert thou for myself !

now cursed be the time of thy nativity !
i would the milk thy mother gave thee when thou her breast , had been a little ratsbane for thy sake !

dost thou deny thy father , cursed drab ?

exit take her away , for she hath lived too long , to fill the world with vicious qualities .
first , let me tell you whom you have condemn not me begotten of a shepherd swain , but issued from the progeny of kings , virtuous and holy , chosen from above , by inspiration of celestial grace , to work exceeding miracles on earth .
i never had to do with wicked spirits but you , that are polluted with your lusts , stain with the guiltless blood of innocents , corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices , because you want the grace that others have , you judge it straight a thing impossible to compass wonders but by help of devils .
no , misconceived !
joan of arc hath been a virgin from her tender infancy , chaste and immaculate in very thought , whose maiden blood , thus rigorously effused , will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven .
ay , ay away with her to execution !
and hark ye , sirs , because she is a maid , spare for no faggots , let there be enow place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake , that so her torture may be shortened .
will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts ?
then , joan , discover thine infirmity , that warranteth by law to be thy privilege .
i am with child , ye bloody homicides murder not then the fruit within my womb , although ye hale me to a violent death .
now heaven forfend !
the holy maid with child !
the greatest miracle that ye wrought is all your strict preciseness come to this ?
she and the dauphin have been juggling i did imagine what would be her refuge .
well , go to , we have no bastards live , especially since charles must father it .
you are deceived , my child is none of his it was alencon that enjoy my love .
alencon !

o , give me leave , i have deluded you was neither charles nor yet the duke i named , but reignier , king of naples , that prevail .

why , here a girl !
i think she knows not well , there were so many , whom she may accuse .
it sign she hath been liberal and free .
and yet , forsooth , she is a virgin pure .
strumpet , thy words condemn thy brat and thee use no entreaty , for it is in vain .

exit , guarded break thou in pieces and consume to ashes , thou foul accursed minister of hell !
enter cardinal of winchester , attended cardinal lord regent , i do greet your excellence with letters of commission from the king .
for know , my lords , the states of christendom , moved with remorse of these outrageous broils , have earnestly implored a general peace betwixt our nation and the aspiring french , and here at hand the dauphin and his train approacheth , to confer about some matter .
is all our travail turn to this effect ?
after the slaughter of so many peers , so many captains , gentlemen and soldiers , that in this quarrel have been overthrown and sold their bodies for their country benefit , shall we at last conclude effeminate peace ?
have we not lost most part of all the towns , by treason , falsehood and by treachery , our great progenitors had conquered ?
o warwick , warwick !
i foresee with grief the utter loss of all the realm of france .
be patient , york if we conclude a peace , it shall be with such strict and severe covenants as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby .
enter charles , alencon , bastard of orleans , reignier , and others since , lords of england , it is thus agreed that peaceful truce shall be proclaim in france , we come to be informed by yourselves what the conditions of that league must be .
speak , winchester , for boiling choler chokes the hollow passage of my poison voice , by sight of these our baleful enemies .
cardinal charles , and the rest , it is enacted thus that , in regard king henry gives consent , of mere compassion and of lenity , to ease your country of distressful war , and suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace , you shall become true liegemen to his crown and charles , upon condition thou wilt swear to pay him tribute , submit thyself , thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him , and still enjoy thy regal dignity .
must he be then as shadow of himself ?
adorn his temples with a coronet , and yet , in substance and authority , retain but privilege of a private man ?
this proffer is absurd and reasonless .
is known already that i am possess with more than half the gallian territories , and therein reverenced for their lawful king shall i , for lucre of the rest unvanquish , detract so much from that prerogative , as to be call but viceroy of the whole ?
no , lord ambassador , i rather keep that which i have than , coveting for more , be cast from possibility of all .
insulting charles !
hast thou by secret means used intercession to obtain a league , and , now the matter grows to compromise , thou aloof upon comparison ?
either accept the title thou , of benefit proceeding from our king and not of any challenge of desert , or we will plague thee with incessant wars .
my lord , you do not well in obstinacy to cavil in the course of this contract if once it be neglected , ten to one we shall not find like opportunity .
to say the truth , it is your policy to save your subjects from such massacre and ruthless slaughters as are daily seen by our proceeding in hostility , and therefore take this compact of a truce , although you break it when your pleasure serves .
how thou , charles ?
shall our condition stand ?
it shall , only reserved , you claim no interest in any of our towns of garrison .
then swear allegiance to his majesty , as thou art knight , never to disobey nor be rebellious to the crown of england , thou , nor thy nobles , to the crown of england .
so , now dismiss your army when ye please hang up your ensign , let your drums be still , for here we entertain a solemn peace .
exeunt scene london .
the palace .
enter suffolk in conference with king henry vi , gloucester and exeter your wondrous rare description , noble earl , of beauteous margaret hath astonish me her virtues graced with external gifts do breed love settled passions in my heart and like as rigor of tempestuous gusts provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide , so am i driven by breath of her renown either to suffer shipwreck or arrive where i may have fruition of her love .
tush , my good lord , this superficial tale is but a preface of her worthy praise , the chief perfections of that lovely dame had i sufficient skill to utter them , would make a volume of enticing lines , able to ravish any dull conceit and , which is more , she is not so divine , so with choice of all delights , but with as humble lowliness of mind she is content to be at your command , command , i mean , of virtuous chaste intents , to love and honour henry as her lord .
and otherwise will henry presume .
therefore , my lord protector , give consent that margaret may be england royal queen .
so should i give consent to flatter sin .
you know , my lord , your highness is betroth unto another lady of esteem how shall we then dispense with that contract , and not deface your honour with reproach ?
as doth a ruler with unlawful oaths , or one that , at a triumph having vow to try his strength , forsaketh yet the lists by reason of his adversary odds a poor earl daughter is unequal odds , and therefore may be broke without offence .
why , what , i pray , is margaret more than that ?
her father is no better than an earl , although in glorious titles he excel .
yes , lord , her father is a king , the king of naples and jerusalem , and of such great authority in france as his alliance will confirm our peace and keep the frenchmen in allegiance .
and so the earl of armagnac may do , because he is near kinsman unto charles .
beside , his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower , where reignier sooner will receive than give .
a dower , my lords !
disgrace not so your king , that he should be so abject , base and poor , to choose for wealth and not for perfect love .
henry is able to enrich his queen and not seek a queen to make him rich so worthless peasants bargain for their wives , as for oxen , sheep , or horse .
marriage is a matter of more worth than to be dealt in by attorneyship , not whom we will , but whom his grace affects , must be companion of his nuptial bed and therefore , lords , since he affects her most , it most of all these reasons bindeth us , in our opinions she should be preferr .
for what is wedlock forced but a hell , an age of discord and continual strife ?
whereas the contrary bringeth bliss , and is a pattern of celestial peace .
whom should we match with henry , being a king , but margaret , that is daughter to a king ?
her peerless feature , joined with her birth , approves her fit for none but for a king her valiant courage and undaunted spirit , more than in women commonly is seen , will answer our hope in issue of a king , for henry , son unto a conqueror , is likely to beget more conquerors , if with a lady of so high resolve as is fair margaret he be link in love .
then yield , my lords , and here conclude with me that margaret shall be queen , and none but she .
whether it be through force of your report , my noble lord of suffolk , or for that my tender youth was never yet attaint with any passion of inflaming love , i can not tell , but this i am assured , i feel such sharp dissension in my breast , such fierce alarums both of hope and fear , as i am sick with working of my thoughts .
take , therefore , shipping , post , my lord , to france , agree to any covenants , and procure that lady margaret do vouchsafe to come to cross the seas to england and be crown king henry faithful and anointed queen for your expenses and sufficient charge , among the people gather up a tenth .
be gone , i say , for , till you do return , i rest perplexed with a thousand cares .
and you , good uncle , banish all offence if you do censure me by what you were , not what you are , i know it will excuse this sudden execution of my will .
and so , conduct me where , from company , i may revolve and ruminate my grief .
exit ay , grief , i fear me , both at first and last .
exeunt gloucester and exeter thus suffolk hath prevail , and thus he goes , as did the youthful paris once to greece , with hope to find the like event in love , but prosper better than the trojan did .

welcome , queen margaret i can express no kinder sign of love than this kind kiss .
o lord , that lends me life , lend me a heart replete with thankfulness !
for thou hast given me in this beauteous face a world of earthly blessings to my soul , if sympathy of love unite our thoughts .
great king of england and my gracious lord , the mutual conference that my mind hath had , by day , by night , waking and in my dreams , in courtly company or at my beads , with you , mine sovereign , makes me the bolder to salute my king with ruder terms , such as my wit affords and of heart doth minister .
her sight did ravish , but her grace in speech , her words with wisdom majesty , makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys , such is the fulness of my heart content .
lords , with one cheerful voice welcome my love .

item , that the duchy of anjou and the county of maine shall be released and delivered to the king her father ' lets the paper fall uncle , how now !
pardon me , gracious lord , some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart and dimm mine eyes , that i can read no further .
uncle of winchester , i pray , read on .
reads , it is further agreed between them , that the duchies of anjou and maine shall be released and delivered over to the king her father , and she sent over of the king of england own proper cost and charges , without having any dowry . '
they please us well .
lord marquess , kneel down we here create thee the first duke of suffolk , and gird thee with the sword .
cousin of york , we here discharge your grace from being regent i ' the parts of france , till term of eighteen months be full expired .
thanks , uncle winchester , gloucester , york , buckingham , somerset , salisbury , and warwick , we thank you all for the great favour done , in entertainment to my princely queen .
come , let us in , and with all speed provide to see her coronation be perform .
exeunt king henry vi , queen margaret , and suffolk brave peers of england , pillars of the state , to you duke humphrey must unload his grief , your grief , the common grief of all the land .
what !
did my brother henry spend his youth , his valour , coin and people , in the wars ?
did he so often lodge in open field , in winter cold and summer parching heat , to conquer france , his true inheritance ?
and did my brother bedford toil his wits , to keep by policy what henry got ?
have you yourselves , somerset , buckingham , brave york , salisbury , and victorious warwick , received deep scars in france and normandy ?
or hath mine uncle beaufort and myself , with all the learned council of the realm , studied so long , sat in the early and late , debating to and fro how france and frenchmen might be kept in awe , and had his highness in his infancy crowned in paris in despite of foes ?
and shall these labours and these honours die ?
shall henry conquest , bedford vigilance , your deeds of war and all our counsel die ?
o peers of england , shameful is this league !
fatal this marriage , cancelling your fame , blotting your names from books of memory , razing the characters of your renown , defacing monuments of conquer france , undoing all , as all had never been !
nephew , what means this passionate discourse , this peroration with such circumstance ?
for france , is ours , and we will keep it still .
ay , uncle , we will keep it , if we can , but now it is impossible we should suffolk , the duke that rules the roast , hath given the duchy of anjou and maine unto the poor king reignier , whose large style agrees not with the leanness of his purse .
now , by the death of him that died for all , these counties were the keys of normandy .
but wherefore weeps warwick , my valiant son ?
for grief that they are past recovery for , were there hope to conquer them again , my sword should shed hot blood , mine eyes no tears .
anjou and maine !
myself did win them both , those provinces these arms of mine did conquer and are the cities , that i got with wounds , delivered up again with peaceful words ?
mort dieu !
for suffolk duke , may he be suffocate , that dims the honour of this warlike isle !
france should have torn and rent my very heart , before i would have yielded to this league .
i never read but england kings have had large sums of gold and dowries with their wives and our king henry gives away his own , to match with her that brings no vantages .
a proper jest , and never heard before , that suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth for costs and charges in transporting her !
she should have stayed in france and starved in france , before my lord of gloucester , now ye grow too hot it was the pleasure of my lord the king .
my lord of winchester , i know your mind , is not my speeches that you do mislike , but is my presence that doth trouble ye .
rancour will out proud prelate , in thy face i see thy fury if i longer stay , we shall begin our ancient bickerings .
lordings , farewell , and say , when i am gone , i prophesied france will be lost ere long .
exit so , there goes our protector in a rage .
is known to you he is mine enemy , nay , more , an enemy unto you all , and no great friend , i fear me , to the king .
consider , lords , he is the next of blood , and heir apparent to the english crown had henry got an empire by his marriage , and all the wealthy kingdoms of the west , there reason he should be displeased at it .
look to it , lords !
let not his smoothing words bewitch your hearts , be wise and circumspect .
what though the common people favour him , calling him , the good duke of gloucester , ' clapping their hands , and crying with loud voice , maintain your royal excellence ! '
with preserve the good duke humphrey ! '
i fear me , lords , for all this flattering gloss , he will be found a dangerous protector .
why should he , then , protect our sovereign , he being of age to govern of himself ?
cousin of somerset , join you with me , and all together , with the duke of suffolk , we quickly hoise duke humphrey from his seat .
this weighty business will not brook delay i to the duke of suffolk presently .
exit cousin of buckingham , though humphrey pride and greatness of his place be grief to us , yet let us watch the haughty cardinal his insolence is more intolerable than all the princes in the land beside if gloucester be displaced , he be protector .
or thou or i , somerset , will be protector , despite duke humphrey or the cardinal .
exeunt buckingham and somerset pride went before , ambition follows him .
while these do labour for their own preferment , behoves it us to labour for the realm .
i never saw but humphrey duke of gloucester did bear him like a noble gentleman .
oft have i seen the haughty cardinal , more like a soldier than a man o ' the church , as stout and proud as he were lord of all , swear like a ruffian and demean himself unlike the ruler of a commonweal .
warwick , my son , the comfort of my age , thy deeds , thy plainness and thy housekeeping , hath won the greatest favour of the commons , excepting none but good duke humphrey and , brother york , thy acts in ireland , in bringing them to civil discipline , thy late exploits done in the heart of france , when thou wert regent for our sovereign , have made thee fear and honour of the people join we together , for the public good , in what we can , to bridle and suppress the pride of suffolk and the cardinal , with somerset and buckingham ambition , and , as we may , cherish duke humphrey deeds , while they do tend the profit of the land .
so god help warwick , as he loves the land , and common profit of his country !
aside and so says york , for he hath greatest cause .
then let make haste away , and look unto the main .
unto the main !
o father , maine is lost , that maine which by main force warwick did win , and would have kept so long as breath did last !
main chance , father , you meant , but i meant maine , which i will win from france , or else be slain , exeunt warwick and salisbury anjou and maine are given to the french , paris is lost , the state of normandy stands on a tickle point , now they are gone suffolk concluded on the articles , the peers agreed , and henry was well pleased to change two dukedoms for a duke fair daughter .
i can not blame them all what to them ?
is thine they give away , and not their own .
pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage and purchase friends and give to courtezans , still revelling like lords till all be gone , while as the silly owner of the goods weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands and shakes his head and trembling stands aloof , while all is shared and all is borne away , ready to starve and dare not touch his own so york must sit and fret and bite his tongue , while his own lands are bargain for and sold .
methinks the realms of england , france and ireland bear that proportion to my flesh and blood as did the fatal brand althaea burn unto the prince heart of calydon .
anjou and maine both given unto the french !
cold news for me , for i had hope of france , even as i have of fertile england soil .
a day will come when york shall claim his own , and therefore i will take the nevils ' parts and make a show of love to proud duke humphrey , and , when i spy advantage , claim the crown , for that the golden mark i seek to hit nor shall proud lancaster usurp my right , nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist , nor wear the diadem upon his head , whose humours fits not for a crown .
then , york , be still awhile , till time do serve watch thou and wake when others be asleep , to pry into the secrets of the state , till henry , surfeiting in joys of love , with his new bride and england queen , and humphrey with the peers be at jars then will i raise aloft the rose , with whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed , and in my standard bear the arms of york to grapple with the house of lancaster , and , force perforce , i make him yield the crown , whose bookish rule hath pull fair england down .
exit scene ii .
gloucester house .
enter gloucester and his duchess why droops my lord , like corn , hanging the head at ceres ' plenteous load ?
why doth the great duke humphrey knit his brows , as frowning at the favours of the world ?
why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth , gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight ?
what seest thou there ?
king henry diadem , enchased with all the honours of the world ?
if so , gaze on , and grovel on thy face , until thy head be circled with the same .
put forth thy hand , reach at the glorious gold .
what , too short ?
i lengthen it with mine and , having both together heaved it up , we both together lift our heads to heaven , and never more abase our sight so low as to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground .
o nell , sweet nell , if thou dost love thy lord , banish the canker of ambitious thoughts .
and may that thought , when i imagine ill against my king and nephew , virtuous henry , be my last breathing in this mortal world !
my troublous dream this night doth make me sad .
what dream my lord ?
tell me , and i requite it with sweet rehearsal of my morning dream .
methought this staff , mine in court , was broke in twain , by whom i have forgot , but , as i think , it was by the cardinal , and on the pieces of the broken wand were placed the heads of edmund duke of somerset , and william de la pole , first duke of suffolk .
this was my dream what it doth bode , god knows .
tut , this was nothing but an argument that he that breaks a stick of gloucester grove shall lose his head for his presumption .
but list to me , my humphrey , my sweet duke methought i sat in seat of majesty in the cathedral church of westminster , and in that chair where kings and queens are crown , where henry and dame margaret kneel to me and on my head did set the diadem .
nay , eleanor , then must i chide outright presumptuous dame , eleanor , art thou not second woman in the realm , and the protector wife , beloved of him ?
hast thou not worldly pleasure at command , above the reach or compass of thy thought ?
and wilt thou still be hammering treachery , to tumble down thy husband and thyself from top of honour to disgrace feet ?
away from me , and let me hear no more !
what , what , my lord !
are you so choleric with eleanor , for telling but her dream ?
next time i keep my dreams unto myself , and not be cheque .
nay , be not angry , i am pleased again .
enter messenger my lord protector , is his highness ' pleasure you do prepare to ride unto saint alban , where as the king and queen do mean to hawk .
i go .
come , nell , thou wilt ride with us ?
yes , my good lord , i follow presently .
exeunt gloucester and messenger follow i must , i can not go before , while gloucester bears this base and humble mind .
were i a man , a duke , and next of blood , i would remove these tedious and smooth my way upon their headless necks , and , being a woman , i will not be slack to play my part in fortune pageant .
where are you there ?
sir john !
nay , fear not , man , we are alone , here none but thee and i .
enter hume jesus preserve your royal majesty !
what thou ?
majesty !
i am but grace .
but , by the grace of god , and hume advice , your grace title shall be multiplied .
what thou , man ?
hast thou as yet conferr with margery jourdain , the cunning witch , with roger bolingbroke , the conjurer ?
and will they undertake to do me good ?
this they have promised , to show your highness a spirit raised from depth of , that shall make answer to such questions as by your grace shall be propounded him .
it is enough , i think upon the questions when from alban we do make return , we see these things effected to the full .
here , hume , take this reward , make merry , man , with thy confederates in this weighty cause .
exit hume must make merry with the duchess ' gold , marry , and shall .
but how now , sir john hume !
seal up your lips , and give no words but mum the business asketh silent secrecy .
dame eleanor gives gold to bring the witch gold can not come amiss , were she a devil .
yet have i gold flies from another coast , i dare not say , from the rich cardinal and from the great and duke of suffolk , yet i do find it so , for to be plain , they , knowing dame eleanor aspiring humour , have hired me to undermine the duchess and buz these conjurations in her brain .
they say ' a crafty knave does need no broker , ' yet am i suffolk and the cardinal broker .
hume , if you take not heed , you shall go near to call them both a pair of crafty knaves .
well , so it stands , and thus , i fear , at last hume knavery will be the duchess ' wreck , and her attainture will be humphrey fall sort how it will , i shall have gold for all .
exit scene iii .
the palace .
enter three or four petitioners , peter , the armourer man , being one my masters , let stand close my lord protector will come this way by and by , and then we may deliver our supplications in the quill .
marry , the lord protect him , for he a good man !
jesu bless him !
enter suffolk and queen margaret here a ' comes , methinks , and the queen with him .
i be the first , sure .
come back , fool , this is the duke of suffolk , and not my lord protector .
how now , fellow !
anything with me ?
i pray , my lord , pardon me , i took ye for my lord protector .
reading my lord protector ! '
are your supplications to his lordship ?
let me see them what is thine ?
mine is , a please your grace , against john goodman , my lord cardinal man , for keeping my house , and lands , and wife and all , from me .
thy wife , too !
that some wrong , indeed .
what yours ?
what here !
reads the duke of suffolk , for enclosing the commons of melford . '
how now , sir knave !
alas , sir , i am but a poor petitioner of our whole township .
giving his petition against my master , thomas horner , for saying that the duke of york was rightful heir to the crown .
what sayst thou ?
did the duke of york say he was rightful heir to the crown ?
that my master was ?
no , forsooth my master said that he was , and that the king was an usurper .
who is there ?
enter servant take this fellow in , and send for his master with a pursuivant presently we hear more of your matter before the king .
exit servant with peter and as for you , that love to be protected under the wings of our protector grace , begin your suits anew , and sue to him .
tears the supplication away , base cullions !
suffolk , let them go .
come , let be gone .
exeunt my lord of suffolk , say , is this the guise , is this the fashion in the court of england ?
is this the government of britain isle , and this the royalty of albion king ?
what shall king henry be a pupil still under the surly gloucester governance ?
am i a queen in title and in style , and must be made a subject to a duke ?
i tell thee , pole , when in the city tours thou a tilt in honour of my love and stolest away the ladies ' hearts of france , i thought king henry had resembled thee in courage , courtship and proportion but all his mind is bent to holiness , to number on his beads , his champions are the prophets and apostles , his weapons holy saws of sacred writ , his study is his , and his loves are brazen images of canonized saints .
i would the college of the cardinals would choose him pope , and carry him to rome , and set the triple crown upon his head that were a state fit for his holiness .
madam , be patient as i was cause your highness came to england , so will i in england work your grace full content .
beside the haughty protector , have we beaufort , the imperious churchman , somerset , buckingham , and grumbling york and not the least of these but can do more in england than the king .
and he of these that can do most of all can not do more in england than the nevils salisbury and warwick are no simple peers .
not all these lords do vex me half so much as that proud dame , the lord protector wife .
she sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies , more like an empress than duke humphrey wife strangers in court do take her for the queen she bears a duke revenues on her back , and in her heart she scorns our poverty shall i not live to be avenged on her ?
contemptuous callet as she is , she vaunted her minions day , the very train of her worst wearing gown was better worth than all my father lands , till suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter .
madam , myself have limed a bush for her , and placed a quire of such enticing birds , that she will light to listen to the lays , and never mount to trouble you again .
so , let her rest and , madam , list to me , for i am bold to counsel you in this .
although we fancy not the cardinal , yet must we join with him and with the lords , till we have brought duke humphrey in disgrace .
as for the duke of york , this late complaint will make but little for his benefit .
so , one by one , we weed them all at last , and you yourself shall steer the happy helm .
sound a sennet .
enter king henry vi , gloucester , cardinal , buckingham , york , somerset , salisbury , warwick , and the duchess for my part , noble lords , i care not which , or somerset or york , all one to me .
if york have ill demean himself in france , then let him be denay the regentship .
if somerset be unworthy of the place , let york be regent , i will yield to him .
whether your grace be worthy , yea or no , dispute not that york is the worthier .
ambitious warwick , let thy betters speak .
the cardinal not my better in the field .
all in this presence are thy betters , warwick .
warwick may live to be the best of all .
peace , son !
and show some reason , buckingham , why somerset should be preferred in this .
because the king , forsooth , will have it so .
madam , the king is old enough himself to give his censure these are no women matters .
if he be old enough , what needs your grace to be protector of his excellence ?
madam , i am protector of the realm , and , at his pleasure , will resign my place .
resign it then and leave thine insolence .
since thou wert king as who is king but thou ? the commonwealth hath daily run to wreck , the dauphin hath prevail beyond the seas , and all the peers and nobles of the realm have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty .
the commons hast thou rack , the clergy bags are lank and lean with thy extortions .
thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife attire have cost a mass of public treasury .
thy cruelty in execution upon offenders , hath exceeded law , and left thee to the mercy of the law .
they sale of offices and towns in france , if they were known , as the suspect is great , would make thee quickly hop without thy head .
exit gloucester .
queen margaret drops her fan give me my fan what , minion !
can ye not ?
she gives the duchess a box on the ear i cry you mercy , madam , was it you ?
i !
yea , i it was , proud frenchwoman could i come near your beauty with my nails , i set my ten commandments in your face .
sweet aunt , be quiet , was against her will .
against her will !
good king , look in time , she hamper thee , and dandle thee like a baby though in this place most master wear no breeches , she shall not strike dame eleanor unrevenged .
exit lord cardinal , i will follow eleanor , and listen after humphrey , how he proceeds she tickled now , her fume needs no spurs , she gallop far enough to her destruction .
exit gloucester now , lords , my choler being with walking once about the quadrangle , i come to talk of commonwealth affairs .
as for your spiteful false objections , prove them , and i lie open to the law but god in mercy so deal with my soul , as i in duty love my king and country !
but , to the matter that we have in hand i say , my sovereign , york is meetest man to be your regent in the realm of france .
before we make election , give me leave to show some reason , of no little force , that york is most unmeet of any man .
i tell thee , suffolk , why i am unmeet first , for i can not flatter thee in pride , next , if i be appointed for the place , my lord of somerset will keep me here , without discharge , money , or furniture , till france be won into the dauphin hands last time , i danced attendance on his will till paris was besieged , famish , and lost .
that can i witness , and a fouler fact did never traitor in the land commit .
peace , headstrong warwick !
image of pride , why should i hold my peace ?
enter horner , the armourer , and his man peter , guarded because here is a man accused of treason pray god the duke of york excuse himself !
doth any one accuse york for a traitor ?
what thou , suffolk , tell me , what are these ?
please it your majesty , this is the man that doth accuse his master of high treason his words were these that richard , duke of york , was rightful heir unto the english crown and that your majesty was a usurper .
say , man , were these thy words ?
a shall please your majesty , i never said nor thought any such matter god is my witness , i am falsely accused by the villain .
by these ten bones , my lords , he did speak them to me in the garret one night , as we were scouring my lord of york armour .
base dunghill villain and mechanical , i have thy head for this thy traitor speech .
i do beseech your royal majesty , let him have all the rigor of the law .
alas , my lord , hang me , if ever i spake the words .
my accuser is my , and when i did correct him for his fault the other day , he did vow upon his knees he would be even with me i have good witness of this therefore i beseech your majesty , do not cast away an honest man for a villain accusation .
uncle , what shall we say to this in law ?
this doom , my lord , if i may judge let somerset be regent over the french , because in york this breeds suspicion and let these have a day appointed them for single combat in convenient place , for he hath witness of his servant malice this is the law , and this duke humphrey doom .
i humbly thank your royal majesty .
and i accept the combat willingly .
alas , my lord , i can not fight , for god sake , pity my case .
the spite of man prevaileth against me .
o lord , have mercy upon me !
i shall never be able to fight a blow .
o lord , my heart !
sirrah , or you must fight , or else be hang .
away with them to prison , and the day of combat shall be the last of the next month .

madam , sit you and fear not whom we raise , we will make fast within a hallow verge .
here they do the ceremonies belonging , and make the circle , bolingbroke or southwell reads , conjuro te , and it thunders and lightens terribly , then the spirit riseth adsum .

but what a point , my lord , your falcon made , and what a pitch she flew above the rest !
to see how god in all his creatures works !
yea , man and birds are fain of climbing high .
no marvel , an it like your majesty , my lord protector hawks do tower so well , they know their master loves to be aloft , and bears his thoughts above his falcon pitch .
my lord , is but a base ignoble mind that mounts no higher than a bird can soar .
i thought as much , he would be above the clouds .
ay , my lord cardinal ?
how think you by that ?
were it not good your grace could fly to heaven ?
the treasury of everlasting joy .
thy heaven is on earth , thine eyes and thoughts beat on a crown , the treasure of thy heart , pernicious protector , dangerous peer , that it so with king and commonweal !
what , cardinal , is your priesthood grown peremptory ?
tantaene animis coelestibus irae ?
churchmen so hot ?
good uncle , hide such malice , with such holiness can you do it ?
no malice , sir , no more than well becomes so good a quarrel and so bad a peer .
as who , my lord ?
why , as you , my lord , a like your lordly .
why , suffolk , england knows thine insolence .

enter a townsman of saint alban , crying ' a miracle ! '
what means this noise ?
fellow , what miracle dost thou proclaim ?

enter the mayor of saint alban and his brethren , bearing simpcox , between two in a chair , simpcox wife following here comes the townsmen on procession , to present your highness with the man .
great is his comfort in this earthly vale , although by his sight his sin be multiplied .
stand by , my masters bring him near the king , his highness ' pleasure is to talk with him .
good fellow , tell us here the circumstance , that we for thee may glorify the lord .
what , hast thou been long blind and now restored ?
born blind , a please your grace .
ay , indeed , was he .
what woman is this ?
his wife , a like your worship .
hadst thou been his mother , thou couldst have better told .
where wert thou born ?
at berwick in the north , a like your grace .
poor soul , god goodness hath been great to thee let never day nor night unhallow pass , but still remember what the lord hath done .
tell me , good fellow , camest thou here by chance , or of devotion , to this holy shrine ?
god knows , of pure devotion , being call a hundred times and oftener , in my sleep , by good saint alban , who said , , come , come , offer at my shrine , and i will help thee . '
most true , forsooth , and many time and oft myself have heard a voice to call him so .
what , art thou lame ?
ay , god almighty help me !
how camest thou so ?
a fall off of a tree .
a , master .
how long hast thou been blind ?
born so , master .
what , and wouldst climb a tree ?
but that in all my life , when i was a youth .
too true , and bought his climbing very dear .
mass , thou lovedst plums well , that wouldst venture so .
alas , good master , my wife desired some damsons , and made me climb , with danger of my life .
a subtle knave !
but yet it shall not serve .
let me see thine eyes wink now now open them in my opinion yet thou seest not well .
yes , master , clear as day , i thank god and saint alban .
thou me so ?
what colour is this cloak of ?
red , master , red as blood .
why , that well said .
what colour is my gown of ?
black , forsooth as jet .
why , then , thou what colour jet is of ?
and yet , i think , jet did he never see .
but cloaks and gowns , before this day , a many .
never , before this day , in all his life .
tell me , sirrah , what my name ?
alas , master , i know not .
what his name ?
i know not .
nor his ?
no , indeed , master .
what thine own name ?
saunder simpcox , an if it please you , master .
then , saunder , sit there , the lyingest knave in christendom .
if thou hadst been born blind , thou mightest as well have known all our names as thus to name the several colours we do wear .
sight may distinguish of colours , but suddenly to nominate them all , it is impossible .
my lords , saint alban here hath done a miracle , and would ye not think his cunning to be great , that could restore this cripple to his legs again ?
o master , that you could !
my masters of saint alban , have you not beadles in your town , and things called whips ?
yes , my lord , if it please your grace .
then send for one presently .
sirrah , go fetch the beadle hither straight .
exit an attendant now fetch me a stool hither by and by .
now , sirrah , if you mean to save yourself from whipping , leap me over this stool and run away .
alas , master , i am not able to stand alone you go about to torture me in vain .
enter a beadle with whips well , sir , we must have you find your legs .
sirrah beadle , whip him till he leap over that same stool .
i will , my lord .
come on , sirrah , off with your doublet quickly .
alas , master , what shall i do ?
i am not able to stand .
after the beadle hath hit him once , he leaps over the stool and runs away , and they follow and cry , ' a miracle ! '
o god , seest thou this , and bearest so long ?
it made me laugh to see the villain run .
follow the knave , and take this drab away .
alas , sir , we did it for pure need .
let them be whipped through every , till they come to berwick , from whence they came .
exeunt wife , beadle , mayor , and c duke humphrey has done a miracle .
true , made the lame to leap and fly away .
but you have done more miracles than i , you made in a day , my lord , whole towns to fly .
enter buckingham what tidings with our cousin buckingham ?
such as my heart doth tremble to unfold .
a sort of naughty persons , lewdly bent , under the countenance and confederacy of lady eleanor , the protector wife , the ringleader and head of all this rout , have practised dangerously against your state , dealing with witches and with conjurers whom we have apprehended in the fact , raising up wicked spirits from under ground , demanding of king henry life and death , and other of your highness ' , as more at large your grace shall understand .
aside to gloucester and so , my lord protector , by this means your lady is forthcoming yet at london .
this news , i think , hath turn your weapon edge , is like , my lord , you will not keep your hour .
ambitious churchman , leave to afflict my heart sorrow and grief have vanquish all my powers , and , vanquish as i am , i yield to thee , or to the meanest groom .
o god , what mischiefs work the wicked ones , heaping confusion on their own heads thereby !
gloucester , see here the tainture of thy nest .
and look thyself be faultless , thou wert best .
madam , for myself , to heaven i do appeal , how i have loved my king and commonweal and , for my wife , i know not how it stands , sorry i am to hear what i have heard noble she is , but if she have forgot honour and virtue and conversed with such as , like to pitch , defile nobility , i banish her my bed and company and give her as a prey to law and shame , that hath dishonour gloucester honest name .
well , for this night we will repose us here toward london back again , to look into this business thoroughly and call these foul offenders to their answers and poise the cause in justice ' equal scales , whose beam stands sure , whose rightful cause prevails .

edward the black prince died before his father and left behind him richard , his only son , who after edward the third death reign as king , till henry bolingbroke , duke of lancaster , the eldest son and heir of john of gaunt , crown by the name of henry the fourth , seized on the realm , deposed the rightful king , sent his poor queen to france , from whence she came , and him to pomfret , where , as all you know , harmless richard was murder traitorously .
father , the duke hath told the truth thus got the house of lancaster the crown .
which now they hold by force and not by right , for richard , the first son heir , being dead , the issue of the next son should have reign .
but william of hatfield died without an heir .
the third son , duke of clarence , from whose line i claimed the crown , had issue , philippe , a daughter , who married edmund mortimer , earl of march edmund had issue , roger earl of march , roger had issue , edmund , anne and eleanor .
this edmund , in the reign of bolingbroke , as i have read , laid claim unto the crown , and , but for owen glendower , had been king , who kept him in captivity till he died .
but to the rest .
his eldest sister , anne , my mother , being heir unto the crown married richard earl of cambridge , who was son to edmund langley , edward the third fifth son .
by her i claim the kingdom she was heir to roger earl of march , who was the son of edmund mortimer , who married philippe , sole daughter unto lionel duke of clarence so , if the issue of the elder son succeed before the younger , i am king .
what plain proceeding is more plain than this ?
henry doth claim the crown from john of gaunt , the fourth son , york claims it from the third .
till lionel issue fails , his should not reign it fails not yet , but flourishes in thee and in thy sons , fair slips of such a stock .
then , father salisbury , kneel we together , and in this private plot be we the first that shall salute our rightful sovereign with honour of his birthright to the crown .
long live our sovereign richard , england king !
we thank you , lords .
but i am not your king till i be crown and that my sword be stain with of the house of lancaster , and that not suddenly to be perform , but with advice and silent secrecy .
do you as i do in these dangerous days wink at the duke of suffolk insolence , at beaufort pride , at somerset ambition , at buckingham and all the crew of them , till they have snared the shepherd of the flock , that virtuous prince , the good duke humphrey is that they seek , and they in seeking that shall find their deaths , if york can prophesy .
my lord , break we off , we know your mind at full .
my heart assures me that the earl of warwick shall one day make the duke of york a king .
and , nevil , this i do assure myself richard shall live to make the earl of warwick the greatest man in england but the king .

sound a flourish .
exeunt scene iv .
a street .
enter gloucester and his servingmen , in mourning cloaks thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud , and after summer evermore succeeds barren winter , with his wrathful nipping cold so cares and joys abound , as seasons fleet .
sirs , what ?
ten , my lord .
ten is the hour that was appointed me to watch the coming of my punish duchess uneath may she endure the flinty streets , to tread them with her feet .
sweet nell , ill can thy noble mind abrook the abject people gazing on thy face , with envious looks , laughing at thy shame , that erst did follow thy proud when thou didst ride in triumph through the streets .
but , soft !
i think she comes , and i prepare my eyes to see her miseries .
enter the duchess in a white sheet , and a taper burning in her hand , with stanley , the sheriff , and officers so please your grace , we take her from the sheriff .
no , stir not , for your lives , let her pass by .
come you , my lord , to see my open shame ?
now thou dost penance too .
look how they gaze !
see how the giddy multitude do point , and nod their heads , and throw their eyes on thee !
ah , gloucester , hide thee from their hateful looks , and , in thy closet pent up , rue my shame , and ban thine enemies , both mine and thine !
be patient , gentle nell , forget this grief .
ah , gloucester , teach me to forget myself !
for whilst i think i am thy married wife and thou a prince , protector of this land , methinks i should not thus be led along , mail up in shame , with papers on my back , and followed with a rabble that rejoice to see my tears and hear my groans .
the ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet , and when i start , the envious people laugh and bid me be advised how i tread .
ah , humphrey , can i bear this shameful yoke ?
thou that i look upon the world , or count them happy that enjoy the sun ?
no , dark shall be my light and night my day , to think upon my pomp shall be my hell .
sometime i say , i am duke humphrey wife , and he a prince and ruler of the land yet so he ruled and such a prince he was as he stood by whilst i , his forlorn duchess , was made a wonder and a to every idle rascal follower .
but be thou mild and blush not at my shame , nor stir at nothing till the axe of death hang over thee , as , sure , it shortly will , for suffolk , he that can do all in all with her that hateth thee and hates us all , and york and impious beaufort , that false priest , have all limed bushes to betray thy wings , and , fly thou how thou canst , they tangle thee but fear not thou , until thy foot be snared , nor never seek prevention of thy foes .
ah , nell , forbear !
thou aimest all awry , i must offend before i be attainted , and had i twenty times so many foes , and each of them had twenty times their power , all these could not procure me any scathe , so long as i am loyal , true and crimeless .
wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach ?
why , yet thy scandal were not wiped away but i in danger for the breach of law .
thy greatest help is quiet , gentle nell i pray thee , sort thy heart to patience , these few days ' wonder will be quickly worn .
enter a herald i summon your grace to his majesty parliament , holden at bury the first of this next month .
and my consent ask herein before !
this is close dealing .
well , i will be there .
exit herald my nell , i take my leave and , master sheriff , let not her penance exceed the king commission .
a please your grace , here my commission stays , and sir john stanley is appointed now to take her with him to the isle of man .
must you , sir john , protect my lady here ?
so am i given in charge , please your grace .
entreat her not the worse in that i pray you use her well the world may laugh again , and i may live to do you kindness if you do it her and so , sir john , farewell !
what , gone , my lord , and bid me not farewell !
witness my tears , i can not stay to speak .
exeunt gloucester and servingmen art thou gone too ?
all comfort go with thee !
for none abides with me my joy is death , death , at whose name i oft have been afear , because i wish this world eternity .
stanley , i prithee , go , and take me hence , i care not whither , for i beg no favour , only convey me where thou art commanded .
why , madam , that is to the isle of man , there to be used according to your state .
that bad enough , for i am but reproach and shall i then be used reproachfully ?
like to a duchess , and duke humphrey lady , according to that state you shall be used .
sheriff , farewell , and better than i fare , although thou hast been conduct of my shame .
it is my office , and , madam , pardon me .
ay , ay , farewell , thy office is discharged .
come , stanley , shall we go ?
madam , your penance done , throw off this sheet , and go we to attire you for our journey .
my shame will not be shifted with my sheet no , it will hang upon my richest robes and show itself , attire me how i can .
go , lead the way , i long to see my prison .
exeunt act iii scene i .
the abbey at bury st .
edmund .
sound a sennet .
enter king henry vi , queen margaret , cardinal , suffolk , york , buckingham , salisbury and warwick to the parliament i muse my lord of gloucester is not come is not his wont to be the hindmost man , occasion keeps him from us now .
can you not see ?
or will ye not observe the strangeness of his alter countenance ?
with what a majesty he bears himself , how insolent of late he is become , how proud , how peremptory , and unlike himself ?
we know the time since he was mild and affable , and if we did but glance a look , immediately he was upon his knee , that all the court admired him for submission but meet him now , and , be it in the morn , when every one will give the time of day , he knits his brow and shows an angry eye , and passeth by with stiff unbowed knee , disdaining duty that to us belongs .
small curs are not regarded when they grin , but great men tremble when the lion roars , and humphrey is no little man in england .
first note that he is near you in descent , and should you fall , he as the next will mount .
me seemeth then it is no policy , respecting what a rancorous mind he bears and his advantage following your decease , that he should come about your royal person or be admitted to your highness ' council .
by flattery hath he won the commons ' hearts , and when he please to make commotion , is to be fear they all will follow him .
now is the spring , and weeds are , suffer them now , and they the garden and choke the herbs for want of husbandry .
the reverent care i bear unto my lord made me collect these dangers in the duke .
if it be fond , call it a woman fear , which fear if better reasons can supplant , i will subscribe and say i wrong the duke .
my lord of suffolk , buckingham , and york , reprove my allegation , if you can , or else conclude my words effectual .
well hath your highness seen into this duke , and , had i first been put to speak my mind , i think i should have told your grace tale .
the duchess , by his subornation , upon my life , began her devilish practises or , if he were not privy to those faults , yet , by reputing of his high descent , as next the king he was successive heir , and such high vaunts of his nobility , did instigate the bedlam duchess by wicked means to frame our sovereign fall .
smooth runs the water where the brook is deep , and in his simple show he harbours treason .
the fox barks not when he would steal the lamb .
no , no , my sovereign , gloucester is a man unsounded yet and full of deep deceit .
did he not , contrary to form of law , devise strange deaths for small offences done ?
and did he not , in his protectorship , levy great sums of money through the realm for soldiers ' pay in france , and never sent it ?
by means whereof the towns each day revolted .
tut , these are petty faults to faults unknown .
which time will bring to light in smooth duke humphrey .
my lords , at once the care you have of us , to mow down thorns that would annoy our foot , is worthy praise but , shall i speak my conscience , our kinsman gloucester is as innocent from meaning treason to our royal person as is the sucking lamb or harmless dove the duke is virtuous , mild and too well given to dream on evil or to work my downfall .
ah , what more dangerous than this fond affiance !
seems he a dove ?
his feathers are but borrowed , for he disposed as the hateful raven is he a lamb ?
his skin is surely lent him , for he inclined as is the ravenous wolf .
who can not steal a shape that means deceit ?
take heed , my lord , the welfare of us all hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man .
enter somerset all health unto my gracious sovereign !
welcome , lord somerset .
what news from france ?
that all your interest in those territories is utterly bereft you , all is lost .
cold news , lord somerset but god will be done !
aside cold news for me , for i had hope of france as firmly as i hope for fertile england .
thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud and caterpillars eat my leaves away , but i will remedy this gear ere long , or sell my title for a glorious grave .
enter gloucester all happiness unto my lord the king !
pardon , my liege , that i have stay so long .
nay , gloucester , know that thou art come too soon , unless thou wert more loyal than thou art i do arrest thee of high treason here .
well , suffolk , thou shalt not see me blush nor change my countenance for this arrest a heart unspotted is not easily daunted .
the purest spring is not so free from mud as i am clear from treason to my sovereign who can accuse me ?
wherein am i guilty ?
is thought , my lord , that you took bribes of france , and , being protector , stayed the soldiers ' pay , by means whereof his highness hath lost france .
is it but thought so ?
what are they that think it ?
i never robb the soldiers of their pay , nor ever had one penny bribe from france .
so help me god , as i have watch the night , ay , night by night , in studying good for england , that doit that i wrested from the king , or any groat i hoarded to my use , be brought against me at my !
no , many a pound of mine own proper store , because i would not tax the needy commons , have i disbursed to the garrisons , and never ask for restitution .
it serves you well , my lord , to say so much .
i say no more than truth , so help me god !
in your protectorship you did devise strange tortures for offenders never heard of , that england was defamed by tyranny .
why , is well known that , whiles i was protector , pity was all the fault that was in me , for i should melt at an offender tears , and lowly words were ransom for their fault .
unless it were a bloody murderer , or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers , i never gave them condign punishment murder indeed , that bloody sin , i tortured above the felon or what trespass else .
my lord , these faults are easy , quickly answered but mightier crimes are laid unto your charge , whereof you can not easily purge yourself .
i do arrest you in his highness ' name , and here commit you to my lord cardinal to keep , until your further time of trial .
my lord of gloucester , is my special hope that you will clear yourself from all suspect my conscience tells me you are innocent .
ah , gracious lord , these days are dangerous virtue is choked with foul ambition and charity chased hence by rancour hand , foul subornation is predominant and equity exiled your highness ' land .
i know their complot is to have my life , and if my death might make this island happy , and prove the period of their tyranny , i would expend it with all willingness but mine is made the prologue to their play , for thousands more , that yet suspect no peril , will not conclude their plotted tragedy .
beaufort red sparkling eyes blab his heart malice , and suffolk cloudy brow his stormy hate , sharp buckingham unburthens with his tongue the envious load that lies upon his heart , and dogged york , that reaches at the moon , whose overweening arm i have pluck back , by false accuse doth level at my life and you , my sovereign lady , with the rest , causeless have laid disgraces on my head , and with your best endeavour have stirr up my liefest liege to be mine enemy ay , all you have laid your heads together myself had notice of your conventicles and all to make away my guiltless life .
i shall not want false witness to condemn me , nor store of treasons to augment my guilt , the ancient proverb will be well effected ' a staff is quickly found to beat a dog . '
my liege , his railing is intolerable if those that care to keep your royal person from treason secret knife and traitors ' rage be thus upbraided , chid and rated at , and the offender granted scope of speech , make them cool in zeal unto your grace .
hath he not twit our sovereign lady here with ignominious words , though clerkly couch , as if she had suborned some to swear false allegations to his state ?
but i can give the loser leave to chide .
far truer spoke than meant i lose , indeed , beshrew the winners , for they play me false !
and well such losers may have leave to speak .
he wrest the sense and hold us here all day lord cardinal , he is your prisoner .
sirs , take away the duke , and guard him sure .
ah !
thus king henry throws away his crutch before his legs be firm to bear his body .
thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side , and wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first .
ah , that my fear were false !
ah , that it were !
for , good king henry , thy decay i fear .
exit , guarded my lords , what to your wisdoms seemeth best , do or undo , as if ourself were here .
what , will your highness leave the parliament ?
ay , margaret , my heart is drown with grief , whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes , my body round engirt with misery , for what more miserable than discontent ?
ah , uncle humphrey !
in thy face i see the map of honour , truth and loyalty and yet , good humphrey , is the hour to come that i proved thee false or fear thy faith .
what louring star now envies thy estate , that these great lords and margaret our queen do seek subversion of thy harmless life ?
thou never didst them wrong , nor no man wrong , and as the butcher takes away the calf and binds the wretch , and beats it when it strays , bearing it to the bloody , even so remorseless have they borne him hence , and as the dam runs lowing up and down , looking the way her harmless young one went , and can do nought but wail her darling loss , even so myself bewails good gloucester case with sad unhelpful tears , and with dimm eyes look after him and can not do him good , so mighty are his vowed enemies .
his fortunes i will weep , and , each groan say a traitor ?
gloucester he is none . '
exeunt all but queen margaret , cardinal , suffolk , and york , somerset remains apart free lords , cold snow melts with the sun hot beams .
henry my lord is cold in great affairs , too full of foolish pity , and gloucester show beguiles him as the mournful crocodile with sorrow snares relenting passengers , or as the snake roll in a flowering bank , with shining chequer slough , doth sting a child that for the beauty thinks it excellent .
believe me , lords , were none more wise than i and yet herein i judge mine own wit good this gloucester should be quickly rid the world , to rid us of the fear we have of him .
that he should die is worthy policy , but yet we want a colour for his death is meet he be condemn by course of law .
but , in my mind , that were no policy the king will labour still to save his life , the commons haply rise , to save his life , and yet we have but trivial argument , more than mistrust , that shows him worthy death .
so that , by this , you would not have him die .
ah , york , no man alive so fain as i !
is york that hath more reason for his death .
but , my lord cardinal , and you , my lord of suffolk , say as you think , and speak it from your souls , not all one , an empty eagle were set to guard the chicken from a hungry kite , as place duke humphrey for the king protector ?
so the poor chicken should be sure of death .
madam , is true , and not madness , then , to make the fox surveyor of the fold ?
who being accused a crafty murderer , his guilt should be but idly posted over , because his purpose is not executed .
no , let him die , in that he is a fox , by nature proved an enemy to the flock , before his chaps be stain with crimson blood , as humphrey , proved by reasons , to my liege .
and do not stand on quillets how to slay him be it by gins , by snares , by subtlety , sleeping or waking , is no matter how , so he be dead , for that is good deceit which mates him first that first intends deceit .
suffolk , is resolutely spoke .
not resolute , except so much were done , for things are often spoke and seldom meant but that my heart accordeth with my tongue , seeing the deed is meritorious , and to preserve my sovereign from his foe , say but the word , and i will be his priest .
but i would have him dead , my lord of suffolk , ere you can take due orders for a priest say you consent and censure well the deed , and i provide his executioner , i tender so the safety of my liege .
here is my hand , the deed is worthy doing .
and so say i .
and i and now we three have spoke it , it skills not greatly who impugns our doom .
enter a post great lords , from ireland am i come amain , to signify that rebels there are up and put the englishmen unto the sword send succors , lords , and stop the rage betime , before the wound do grow uncurable , for , being green , there is great hope of help .
a breach that craves a quick expedient stop !
what counsel give you in this weighty cause ?
that somerset be sent as regent thither is meet that lucky ruler be employ , witness the fortune he hath had in france .
if york , with all his policy , had been the regent there instead of me , he never would have stay in france so long .
no , not to lose it all , as thou hast done i rather would have lost my life betimes than bring a burthen of dishonour home by staying there so long till all were lost .
show me one scar character on thy skin men flesh preserved so whole do seldom win .
nay , then , this spark will prove a raging fire , if wind and fuel be brought to feed it with no more , good york , sweet somerset , be still thy fortune , york , hadst thou been regent there , might happily have proved far worse than his .
what , worse than nought ?
nay , then , a shame take all !
and , in the number , thee that wishest shame !
my lord of york , try what your fortune is .
the uncivil kerns of ireland are in arms and temper clay with blood of englishmen to ireland will you lead a band of men , collected choicely , from each county some , and try your hap against the irishmen ?
i will , my lord , so please his majesty .
why , our authority is his consent , and what we do establish he confirms then , noble york , take thou this task in hand .
i am content provide me soldiers , lords , whiles i take order for mine own affairs .
a charge , lord york , that i will see perform .
but now return we to the false duke humphrey .
no more of him , for i will deal with him that henceforth he shall trouble us no more .
and so break off , the day is almost spent lord suffolk , you and i must talk of that event .
my lord of suffolk , within fourteen days at bristol i expect my soldiers , for there i ship them all for ireland .
i see it truly done , my lord of york .
exeunt all but york now , york , or never , steel thy fearful thoughts , and change misdoubt to resolution be that thou hopest to be , or what thou art resign to death , it is not worth the enjoying let fear keep with the man , and find no harbour in a royal heart .
faster than showers comes thought on thought , and not a thought but thinks on dignity .
my brain more busy than the labouring spider weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies .
well , nobles , well , is politicly done , to send me packing with an host of men i fear me you but warm the starved snake , who , cherish in your breasts , will sting your hearts .
was men i lack and you will give them me i take it kindly , and yet be well assured you put sharp weapons in a madman hands .
whiles i in ireland nourish a mighty band , i will stir up in england some black storm shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell , and this fell tempest shall not cease to rage until the golden circuit on my head , like to the glorious sun transparent beams , do calm the fury of this flaw .
and , for a minister of my intent , i have seduced a headstrong kentishman , john cade of ashford , to make commotion , as full well he can , under the title of john mortimer .
in ireland have i seen this stubborn cade oppose himself against a troop of kerns , and fought so long , till that his thighs with darts were almost like a porpentine , and , in the end being rescued , i have seen him caper upright like a wild morisco , shaking the bloody darts as he his bells .
full often , like a crafty kern , hath he conversed with the enemy , and undiscover come to me again and given me notice of their villanies .
this devil here shall be my substitute , for that john mortimer , which now is dead , in face , in gait , in speech , he doth resemble by this i shall perceive the commons ' mind , how they affect the house and claim of york .
say he be taken , rack and tortured , i know no pain they can inflict upon him will make him say i moved him to those arms .
say that he thrive , as is great like he will , why , then from ireland come i with my strength and reap the harvest which that rascal sow , for humphrey being dead , as he shall be , and henry put apart , the next for me .

gracious henry , comfort !
what , doth my lord of suffolk comfort me ?
came he right now to sing a raven note , whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers , and thinks he that the chirping of a wren , by crying comfort from a hollow breast , can chase away the sound ?
hide not thy poison with such sugar words , lay not thy hands on me , forbear , i say , their touch affrights me as a serpent sting .
thou baleful messenger , out of my sight !
upon thy murderous tyranny sits in grim majesty , to fright the world .
look not upon me , for thine eyes are wounding yet do not go away come , basilisk , and kill the innocent gazer with thy sight , for in the shade of death i shall find joy , in life but double death , now gloucester dead .
why do you rate my lord of suffolk thus ?
although the duke was enemy to him , yet he most laments his death and for myself , foe as he was to me , might liquid tears or groans or sighs recall his life , i would be blind with weeping , sick with groans , look pale as primrose with sighs , and all to have the noble duke alive .
what know i how the world may deem of me ?
for it is known we were but hollow friends it may be judged i made the duke away , so shall my name with slander tongue be wounded , and princes ' courts be fill with my reproach .
this get i by his death ay me , unhappy !
to be a queen , and crown with infamy !
ah , woe is me for gloucester , wretched man !
be woe for me , more wretched than he is .
what , dost thou turn away and hide thy face ?
i am no loathsome leper , look on me .
what !
art thou , like the adder , waxen deaf ?
be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen .
is all thy comfort shut in gloucester tomb ?
why , then , dame margaret was thy joy .
erect his statue and worship it , and make my image but an alehouse sign .
was i for this nigh wreck upon the sea and twice by awkward wind from england bank drove back again unto my native clime ?
what boded this , but well forewarning wind did seem to say not a scorpion nest , nor set no footing on this unkind shore ' ?
what did i then , but cursed the gentle gusts and he that loosed them forth their brazen caves and bid them blow towards england blessed shore , or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock yet aeolus would not be a murderer , but left that hateful office unto thee the sea refused to drown me , knowing that thou wouldst have me drown on shore , with tears as salt as sea , through thy unkindness the splitting rocks cower in the sinking sands and would not dash me with their ragged sides , because thy flinty heart , more hard than they , might in thy palace perish margaret .
as far as i could ken thy chalky cliffs , when from thy shore the tempest beat us back , i stood upon the hatches in the storm , and when the dusky sky began to rob my sight of thy land view , i took a costly jewel from my neck , a heart it was , bound in with diamonds , and threw it towards thy land the sea received it , and so i wish thy body might my heart and even with this i lost fair england view and bid mine eyes be packing with my heart and call them blind and dusky spectacles , for losing ken of albion wished coast .
how often have i tempted suffolk tongue , the agent of thy foul inconstancy , to sit and witch me , as ascanius did when he to madding dido would unfold his father acts commenced in burning troy !
am i not witch like her ?
or thou not false like him ?
ay me , i can no more !
die , margaret !
for henry weeps that thou dost live so long .
noise within .
enter warwick , salisbury , and many commons it is reported , mighty sovereign , that good duke humphrey traitorously is murder by suffolk and the cardinal beaufort means .
the commons , like an angry hive of bees that want their leader , scatter up and down and care not who they sting in his revenge .
myself have calm their spleenful mutiny , until they hear the order of his death .
that he is dead , good warwick , is too true , but how he died god knows , not henry enter his chamber , view his breathless corpse , and comment then upon his sudden death .
that shall i do , my liege .
stay , salisbury , with the rude multitude till i return .
exit o thou that judgest all things , stay my thoughts , my thoughts , that labour to persuade my soul some violent hands were laid on humphrey life !
if my suspect be false , forgive me , god , for judgment only doth belong to thee .
fain would i go to chafe his paly lips with twenty thousand kisses , and to drain upon his face an ocean of salt tears , to tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk , and with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling but all in vain are these mean obsequies , and to survey his dead and earthly image , what were it but to make my sorrow greater ?
warwick and others , bearing gloucester body on a bed come hither , gracious sovereign , view this body .
that is to see how deep my grave is made , for with his soul fled all my worldly solace , for seeing him i see my life in death .
as surely as my soul intends to live with that dread king that took our state upon him to free us from his father wrathful curse , i do believe that violent hands were laid upon the life of this duke .
a dreadful oath , sworn with a solemn tongue !
what instance gives lord warwick for his vow ?
see how the blood is settled in his face .
oft have i seen a ghost , of ashy semblance , meagre , pale and bloodless , being all descended to the labouring heart , who , in the conflict that it holds with death , attracts the same for aidance the enemy , which with the heart there cools and returneth to blush and beautify the cheek again .
but see , his face is black and full of blood , his further out than when he lived , staring full ghastly like a strangled man , his hair uprear , his nostrils stretched with struggling , his hands abroad display , as one that grasp and tugg for life and was by strength subdued look , on the sheets his hair you see , is sticking , his beard made rough and rugged , like to the summer corn by tempest lodged .
it can not be but he was murder here , the least of all these signs were probable .
why , warwick , who should do the duke to death ?
myself and beaufort had him in protection , and we , i hope , sir , are no murderers .
but both of you were vow duke humphrey foes , and you , forsooth , had the good duke to keep is like you would not feast him like a friend , and is well seen he found an enemy .
then you , belike , suspect these noblemen as guilty of duke humphrey timeless death .
who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh and sees fast by a butcher with an axe , but will suspect was he that made the slaughter ?
who finds the partridge in the puttock nest , but may imagine how the bird was dead , although the kite soar with unbloodied beak ?
even so suspicious is this tragedy .
are you the butcher , suffolk ?
where your knife ?
is beaufort term a kite ?
where are his talons ?
i wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men , but here a vengeful sword , rusted with ease , that shall be scoured in his rancorous heart that slanders me with murder crimson badge .
say , if thou darest , proud lord of , that i am faulty in duke humphrey death .
exeunt cardinal , somerset , and others what dares not warwick , if false suffolk dare him ?
he dares not calm his contumelious spirit nor cease to be an arrogant controller , though suffolk dare him twenty thousand times .
madam , be still , with reverence may i say , for every word you speak in his behalf is slander to your royal dignity .
lord , ignoble in demeanor !
if ever lady wrong her lord so much , thy mother took into her blameful bed some stern untutor churl , and noble stock was graft with slip , whose fruit thou art , and never of the nevils ' noble race .
but that the guilt of murder bucklers thee and i should rob the deathsman of his fee , quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames , and that my sovereign presence makes me mild , i would , false murderous coward , on thy knee make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech , and say it was thy mother that thou that thou thyself was born in bastardy , and after all this fearful homage done , give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell , pernicious of sleeping men !
thou shall be waking well i shed thy blood , if from this presence thou darest go with me .
away even now , or i will drag thee hence unworthy though thou art , i cope with thee and do some service to duke humphrey ghost .
exeunt suffolk and warwick what stronger breastplate than a heart untainted !
thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just , and he but naked , though lock up in steel whose conscience with injustice is corrupted .
a noise within what noise is this ?
suffolk and warwick , with their weapons drawn why , how now , lords !
your wrathful weapons drawn here in our presence !
dare you be so bold ?
why , what tumultuous clamour have we here ?
the traitorous warwick with the men of bury set all upon me , mighty sovereign .
to the commons , entering sirs , stand apart , the king shall know your mind .
dread lord , the commons send you word by me , unless lord suffolk straight be done to death , or banished fair england territories , they will by violence tear him from your palace and torture him with grievous lingering death .
they say , by him the good duke humphrey died , they say , in him they fear your highness ' death , and mere instinct of love and loyalty , free from a stubborn opposite intent , as being thought to contradict your liking , makes them thus forward in his banishment .
they say , in care of your most royal person , that if your highness should intend to sleep and charge that no man should disturb your rest in pain of your dislike or pain of death , yet , notwithstanding such a strait edict , were there a serpent seen , with forked tongue , that slily glided towards your majesty , it were but necessary you were waked , lest , being suffer in that harmful slumber , the mortal worm might make the sleep eternal , and therefore do they cry , though you forbid , that they will guard you , whether you will or no , from such fell serpents as false suffolk is , with whose envenomed and fatal sting , your loving uncle , twenty times his worth , they say , is shamefully bereft of life .
within an answer from the king , my lord of salisbury !
is like the commons , rude unpolish hinds , could send such message to their sovereign but you , my lord , were glad to be employ , to show how quaint an orator you are but all the honour salisbury hath won is , that he was the lord ambassador sent from a sort of tinkers to the king .
within an answer from the king , or we will all break in !
go , salisbury , and tell them all from me .
i thank them for their tender loving care , and had i not been cited so by them , yet did i purpose as they do entreat , for , sure , my thoughts do hourly prophesy mischance unto my state by suffolk means and therefore , by his majesty i swear , whose far unworthy deputy i am , he shall not breathe infection in this air but three days longer , on the pain of death .
exit salisbury o henry , let me plead for gentle suffolk !
ungentle queen , to call him gentle suffolk !
no more , i say if thou dost plead for him , thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath .
had i but said , i would have kept my word , but when i swear , it is irrevocable .
if , after three days ' space , thou here found on any ground that i am ruler of , the world shall not be ransom for thy life .
come , warwick , come , good warwick , go with me , i have great matters to impart to thee .
exeunt all but queen margaret and suffolk mischance and sorrow go along with you !
heart discontent and sour affliction be playfellows to keep you company !
there two of you , the devil make a third !
and threefold vengeance tend upon your steps !
cease , gentle queen , these execrations , and let thy suffolk take his heavy leave .
fie , coward woman and wretch !
hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy ?
a plague upon them !
wherefore should i curse them ?
would curses kill , as doth the mandrake groan , i would invent as terms , as curst , as harsh and horrible to hear , deliver strongly through my fixed teeth , with full as many signs of deadly hate , as envy in her loathsome cave my tongue should stumble in mine earnest words , mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint , mine hair be fixed on end , as one distract , ay , every joint should seem to curse and ban and even now my burthen heart would break , should i not curse them .
poison be their drink !
gall , worse than gall , the daintiest that they taste !
their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees !
their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks !
their softest touch as smart as lizards ' sting !
their music frightful as the serpent hiss , and boding make the concert full !
all the foul terrors in hell enough , sweet suffolk , thou thyself , and these dread curses , like the sun glass , or like an overcharged gun , recoil , and turn the force of them upon thyself .
you bade me ban , and will you bid me leave ?
now , by the ground that i am banish from , well could i curse away a winter night , though standing naked on a mountain top , where biting cold would never let grass grow , and think it but a minute spent in sport .
o , let me entreat thee cease .
give me thy hand , that i may dew it with my mournful tears , nor let the rain of heaven wet this place , to wash away my woful monuments .
o , could this kiss be printed in thy hand , that thou mightst think upon these by the seal , through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee !
so , get thee gone , that i may know my grief , is but surmised whiles thou art standing by , as one that surfeits thinking on a want .
i will repeal thee , or , be well assured , adventure to be banished myself and banished i am , if but from thee .
go , speak not to me , even now be gone .
o , go not yet !
even thus two friends condemn embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves , loather a hundred times to part than die .
yet now farewell , and farewell life with thee !
thus is poor suffolk ten times banished , once by the king , and three times thrice by thee .
is not the land i care for , wert thou thence , a wilderness is populous enough , so suffolk had thy heavenly company for where thou art , there is the world itself , with every several pleasure in the world , and where thou art not , desolation .
i can no more live thou to joy thy life , myself no joy in nought but that thou livest .
enter vaux wither goes vaux so fast ?
what news , i prithee ?
to signify unto his majesty that cardinal beaufort is at point of death , for suddenly a grievous sickness took him , that makes him gasp and stare and catch the air , blaspheming god and cursing men on earth .
sometimes he talks as if duke humphrey ghost were by his side , sometime he calls the king , and whispers to his pillow , as to him , the secrets of his overcharged soul , and i am sent to tell his majesty that even now he cries aloud for him .
go tell this heavy message to the king .
exit vaux ay me !
what is this world !
what news are these !
but wherefore grieve i at an hour poor loss , omitting suffolk exile , my soul treasure ?
why only , suffolk , mourn i not for thee , and with the southern clouds contend in tears , theirs for the earth increase , mine for my sorrows ?
now get thee hence the king , thou , is coming , if thou be found by me , thou art but dead .
if i depart from thee , i can not live , and in thy sight to die , what were it else but like a pleasant slumber in thy lap ?
here could i breathe my soul into the air , as mild and gentle as the dying with mother dug between its lips where , from thy sight , i should be raging mad , and cry out for thee to close up mine eyes , to have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth , so shouldst thou either turn my flying soul , or i should breathe it so into thy body , and then it lived in sweet elysium .
to die by thee were but to die in jest , from thee to die were torture more than death o , let me stay , befall what may befall !
away !
though parting be a fretful corrosive , it is applied to a deathful wound .
to france , sweet suffolk let me hear from thee , for thou art in this world globe , i have an iris that shall find thee out .
i go .
and take my heart with thee .
a jewel , lock into the cask that ever did contain a thing of worth .
even as a splitted bark , so sunder we this way fall i to death .
this way for me .
exeunt severally scene iii .
a bedchamber .
enter the king , salisbury , warwick , to the cardinal in bed how fares my lord ?
speak , beaufort , to thy sovereign .
if thou death , i give thee england treasure , enough to purchase such another island , so thou wilt let me live , and feel no pain .
ah , what a sign it is of evil life , where death approach is seen so terrible !
beaufort , it is thy sovereign speaks to thee .
bring me unto my trial when you will .
died he not in his bed ?
where should he die ?
can i make men live , whether they will or no ?
o , torture me no more !
i will confess .
alive again ?
then show me where he is i give a thousand pound to look upon him .
he hath no eyes , the dust hath blinded them .
comb down his hair , look , look !
it stands upright , like set to catch my winged soul .
give me some drink , and bid the apothecary bring the strong poison that i bought of him .
o thou eternal mover of the heavens .
look with a gentle eye upon this wretch !
o , beat away the busy meddling fiend that lays strong siege unto this wretch soul .
and from his bosom purge this black despair !
see , how the pangs of death do make him grin !
disturb him not , let him pass peaceably .
peace to his soul , if god good pleasure be !
lord cardinal , if thou on heaven bliss , hold up thy hand , make signal of thy hope .
he dies , and makes no sign .
o god , forgive him !
so bad a death argues a monstrous life .
forbear to judge , for we are sinners all .
close up his eyes and draw the curtain close , and let us all to meditation .
exeunt act iv scene i .
the coast of kent .
alarum .
fight at sea .
ordnance goes off .
enter a captain , a master , a , walter whitmore , and others , with them suffolk , and others , prisoners the gaudy , blabbing and remorseful day is crept into the bosom of the sea , and now wolves arouse the jades that drag the tragic melancholy night , who , with their drowsy , slow and flagging wings , clip dead men graves and from their misty jaws breathe foul contagious darkness in the air .
therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize , for , whilst our pinnace anchors in the downs , here shall they make their ransom on the sand , or with their blood stain this discolour shore .
master , this prisoner freely give i thee , and thou that art his mate , make boot of this , the other , walter whitmore , is thy share .
what is my ransom , master ?
let me know .
a thousand crowns , or else lay down your head .
and so much shall you give , or off goes yours .
what , think you much to pay two thousand crowns , and bear the name and port of gentlemen ?
cut both the villains ' throats , for die you shall the lives of those which we have lost in fight be counterpoised with such a petty sum !
i give it , sir , and therefore spare my life .
and so will i and write home for it straight .
i lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard , and therefore to revenge it , shalt thou die , to suffolk and so should these , if i might have my will .
be not so rash , take ransom , let him live .
look on my george , i am a gentleman rate me at what thou wilt , thou shalt be paid .
and so am i , my name is walter whitmore .
how now !
why thou ?
what , doth death affright ?
thy name affrights me , in whose sound is death .
a cunning man did calculate my birth and told me that by water i should die yet let not this make thee be , thy name is gaultier , being rightly sounded .
gaultier or walter , which it is , i care not never yet did base dishonour blur our name , but with our sword we wiped away the blot , therefore , when i sell revenge , broke be my sword , my arms torn and defaced , and i proclaim a coward through the world !
stay , whitmore , for thy prisoner is a prince , the duke of suffolk , william de la pole .
the duke of suffolk muffled up in rags !
ay , but these rags are no part of the duke jove sometimes went disguised , and why not i ?
but jove was never slain , as thou shalt be .
obscure and lowly swain , king henry blood , the honourable blood of lancaster , must not be shed by such a jaded groom .
hast thou not kiss thy hand and held my stirrup ?
plodded by my mule and thought thee happy when i shook my head ?
how often hast thou waited at my cup , fed from my trencher , kneel down at the board .
when i have feasted with queen margaret ?
remember it and let it make thee , ay , and allay this thy abortive pride , how in our voiding lobby hast thou stood and duly waited for my coming forth ?
this hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf , and therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue .
speak , captain , shall i stab the forlorn swain ?
first let my words stab him , as he hath me .
base slave , thy words are blunt and so art thou .
convey him hence and on our longboat side strike off his head .
thou darest not , for thy own .
yes , pole .
pole !
pool !
sir pool !
lord !
ay , kennel , puddle , sink , whose filth and dirt troubles the silver spring where england drinks .
now will i dam up this thy yawning mouth for swallowing the treasure of the realm thy lips that kiss the queen shall sweep the ground , and thou that smiledst at good duke humphrey death , against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain , who in contempt shall hiss at thee again and wedded be thou to the hags of hell , for daring to affy a mighty lord unto the daughter of a worthless king , having neither subject , wealth , nor diadem .
by devilish policy art thou grown great , and , like ambitious sylla , overgorged with gobbets of thy mother bleeding heart .
by thee anjou and maine were sold to france , the false revolting normans thorough thee disdain to call us lord , and picardy hath slain their governors , surprised our forts , and sent the ragged soldiers wounded home .
the princely warwick , and the nevils all , whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain , as hating thee , are rising up in arms and now the house of york , thrust from the crown by shameful murder of a guiltless king and lofty proud encroaching tyranny , burns with revenging fire , whose hopeful colours advance our sun , striving to shine , under the which is writ nubibus . '
the commons here in kent are up in arms and , to conclude , reproach and beggary is crept into the palace of our king .
and all by thee .
away !
convey him hence .
o that i were a god , to shoot forth thunder upon these paltry , servile , abject drudges !
small things make base men proud this villain here , being captain of a pinnace , threatens more than bargulus the strong illyrian pirate .
drones suck not eagles ' blood but rob beehives it is impossible that i should die by such a lowly vassal as thyself .
thy words move rage and not remorse in me i go of message from the queen to france , i charge thee waft me safely cross the channel .
walter , come , suffolk , i must waft thee to thy death .
gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee i fear .
thou shalt have cause to fear before i leave thee .
what , are ye daunted now ?
now will ye stoop ?
my gracious lord , entreat him , speak him fair .
suffolk imperial tongue is stern and rough , used to command , untaught to plead for favour .
far be it we should honour such as these with humble suit no , rather let my head stoop to the block than these knees bow to any save to the god of heaven and to my king , and sooner dance upon a bloody pole than stand uncover to the vulgar groom .
true nobility is exempt from fear more can i bear than you dare execute .
hale him away , and let him talk no more .
come , soldiers , show what cruelty ye can , that this my death may never be forgot !
great men oft die by vile bezonians a roman sworder and banditto slave murder sweet tully , brutus ' bastard hand stabb julius caesar , savage islanders pompey the great , and suffolk dies by pirates .
exeunt whitmore and others with suffolk and as for these whose ransom we have set , it is our pleasure one of them depart , therefore come you with us and let him go .
exeunt all but the first gentleman whitmore with suffolk body there let his head and lifeless body lie , until the queen his mistress bury it .

nay , is too true , therefore he shall be king .
sir , he made a chimney in my father house , and the bricks are alive at this day to testify it , therefore deny it not .

and furthermore , well have the lord say head for selling the dukedom of maine .
and good reason , for thereby is england mained , and fain to go with a staff , but that my puissance holds it up .
fellow kings , i tell you that that lord say hath gelded the commonwealth , and made it an eunuch and more than that , he can speak french , and therefore he is a traitor .
o gross and miserable ignorance !
nay , answer , if you can the frenchmen are our enemies , go to , then , i ask but this can he that speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good counsellor , or no ?
no , no , and therefore we have his head .
well , seeing gentle words will not prevail , assail them with the army of the king .

be it known unto thee by these presence , even the presence of lord mortimer , that i am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such filth as thou art .
thou hast most traitorously corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a grammar school , and whereas , before , our forefathers had no other books but the score and the tally , thou hast caused printing to be used , and , contrary to the king , his crown and dignity , thou hast built a .
it will be proved to thy face that thou hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and a verb , and such abominable words as no christian ear can endure to hear .
thou hast appointed justices of peace , to call poor men before them about matters they were not able to answer .
moreover , thou hast put them in prison , and because they could not read , thou hast hanged them , when , indeed , only for that cause they have been most worthy to live .
thou dost ride in a , dost thou not ?
what of that ?

justice with favour have i always done , prayers and tears have moved me , gifts could never .
when have i aught exacted at your hands , but to maintain the king , the realm and you ?
large gifts have i bestow on learned clerks , because my book preferr me to the king , and seeing ignorance is the curse of god , knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven , unless you be possess with devilish spirits , you can not but forbear to murder me this tongue hath parley unto foreign kings for your behoof , tut , when thou one blow in the field ?

alas , he hath no home , no place to fly to , nor knows he how to live but by the spoil , unless by robbing of your friends and us .
not a shame , that whilst you live at jar , the fearful french , whom you late vanquished , should make a start seas and vanquish you ?
methinks already in this civil broil i see them lording it in london streets , crying ! '

enter cade fie on ambition !
fie on myself , that have a sword , and yet am ready to famish !
these five days have i hid me in these woods and durst not peep out , for all the country is laid for me , but now am i so hungry that if i might have a lease of my life for a thousand years i could stay no longer .
wherefore , on a brick wall have i climbed into this garden , to see if i can eat grass , or pick a sallet another while , which is not amiss to cool a man stomach this hot weather .
and i think this word ' was born to do me good for many a time , but for a sallet , my brainpan had been cleft with a brown bill , and many a time , when i have been dry and bravely marching , it hath served me instead of a quart pot to drink in , and now the word ' must serve me to feed on .
enter iden lord , who would live turmoiled in the court , and may enjoy such quiet walks as these ?
this small inheritance my father left me contenteth me , and worth a monarchy .
i seek not to wax great by others ' waning , or gather wealth , i care not , with what envy sufficeth that i have maintains my state and sends the poor well pleased from my gate .
here the lord of the soil come to seize me for a stray , for entering his without leave .
ah , villain , thou wilt betray me , and get a thousand crowns of the king carrying my head to him but i make thee eat iron like an ostrich , and swallow my sword like a great pin , ere thou and i part .
why , rude companion , thou be , i know thee not , why , then , should i betray thee ?
not enough to break into my garden , and , like a thief , to come to rob my grounds , climbing my walls in spite of me the owner , but thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms ?
brave thee !
ay , by the best blood that ever was broached , and beard thee too .
look on me well i have eat no meat these five days , yet , come thou and thy five men , and if i do not leave you all as dead as a doornail , i pray god i may never eat grass more .
nay , it shall be said , while england stands , that alexander iden , an esquire of kent , took odds to combat a poor famish man .
oppose thy eyes to mine , see if thou canst outface me with thy looks set limb to limb , and thou art far the lesser , thy hand is but a finger to my fist , thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon , my foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast , and if mine arm be heaved in the air , thy grave is digg already in the earth .
as for words , whose greatness answers words , let this my sword report what speech forbears .
by my valour , the most complete champion that ever i heard !
steel , if thou turn the edge , or cut not out the clown in chines of beef ere thou sleep in thy sheath , i beseech god on my knees thou mayst be turned to hobnails .
here they fight .
cade falls o , i am slain !
famine and no other hath slain me let ten thousand devils come against me , and give me but the ten meals i have lost , and i defy them all .
wither , garden , and be henceforth a to all that do dwell in this house , because the unconquered soul of cade is fled .
cade that i have slain , that monstrous traitor ?
sword , i will hollow thee for this thy deed , and hang thee my tomb when i am dead shall this blood be wiped from thy point , but thou shalt wear it as a herald coat , to emblaze the honour that thy master got .
iden , farewell , and be proud of thy victory .
tell kent from me , she hath lost her best man , and exhort all the world to be cowards , for i , that never feared any , am vanquished by famine , not by valour .
dies how much thou me , heaven be my judge .
die , damned wretch , the curse of her that bare thee , and as i thrust thy body in with my sword , so wish i , i might thrust thy soul to hell .
hence will i drag thee headlong by the heels unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave , and there cut off thy most ungracious head , which i will bear in triumph to the king , leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon .

ah !
sancta majestas , who would not buy thee dear ?

enter buckingham whom have we here ?
buckingham , to disturb me ?
the king hath sent him , sure i must dissemble .
york , if thou meanest well , i greet thee well .
humphrey of buckingham , i accept thy greeting .
art thou a messenger , or come of pleasure ?
a messenger from henry , our dread liege , to know the reason of these arms in peace , or why thou , being a subject as i am , against thy oath and true allegiance sworn , should raise so great a power without his leave , or dare to bring thy force so near the court .
aside scarce can i speak , my choler is so great o , i could hew up rocks and fight with flint , i am so angry at these abject terms , and now , like ajax telamonius , on sheep or oxen could i spend my fury .
i am far better born than is the king , more like a king , more kingly in my thoughts but i must make fair weather yet a while , till henry be more weak and i more strong , buckingham , i prithee , pardon me , that i have given no answer all this while , my mind was troubled with deep melancholy .
the cause why i have brought this army hither is to remove proud somerset from the king , seditious to his grace and to the state .
that is too much presumption on thy part but if thy arms be to no other end , the king hath yielded unto thy demand the duke of somerset is in the tower .
upon thine honour , is he prisoner ?
upon mine honour , he is prisoner .
then , buckingham , i do dismiss my powers .
soldiers , i thank you all , disperse yourselves , meet me in george field , you shall have pay and every thing you wish .
and let my sovereign , virtuous henry , command my eldest son , nay , all my sons , as pledges of my fealty and love , i send them all as willing as i live lands , goods , horse , armour , any thing i have , is his to use , so somerset may die .

enter king henry vi and attendants buckingham , doth york intend no harm to us , that thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm ?
in all submission and humility york doth present himself unto your highness .
then what intends these forces thou dost bring ?
to heave the traitor somerset from hence , and fight against that monstrous rebel cade , who since i heard to be discomfited .
enter iden , with cade head if one so rude and of so mean condition may pass into the presence of a king , lo , i present your grace a traitor head , the head of cade , whom i in combat slew .
the head of cade !
great god , how just art thou !
o , let me view his visage , being dead , that living wrought me such exceeding trouble .
tell me , my friend , art thou the man that slew him ?
i was , a like your majesty .
how art thou call ?
and what is thy degree ?
alexander iden , that my name , a poor esquire of kent , that loves his king .
so please it you , my lord , not amiss he were created knight for his good service .
iden , kneel down .

we give thee for reward a thousand marks , and will that thou henceforth attend on us .
may iden live to merit such a bounty .
and never live but true unto his liege !

for thousand yorks he shall not hide his head , but boldly stand and front him to his face .
how now !
is somerset at liberty ?
then , york , unloose thy thoughts , and let thy tongue be equal with thy heart .
shall i endure the sight of somerset ?
false king !
why hast thou broken faith with me , knowing how hardly i can brook abuse ?
king did i call thee ?
no , thou art not king , not fit to govern and rule multitudes , which darest not , no , nor canst not rule a traitor .
that head of thine doth not become a crown , thy hand is made to grasp a palmer staff , and not to grace an awful princely sceptre .
that gold must round engirt these brows of mine , whose smile and frown , like to achilles ' spear , is able with the change to kill and cure .
here is a hand to hold a sceptre up and with the same to act controlling laws .
give place by heaven , thou shalt rule no more him whom heaven created for thy ruler .
o monstrous traitor !
i arrest thee , york , of capital treason the king and crown , obey , audacious traitor , kneel for grace .
wouldst have me kneel ?
first let me ask of these , if they can brook i bow a knee to man .
sirrah , call in my sons to be my bail , exit attendant i know , ere they will have me go to ward , they pawn their swords for my enfranchisement .
call hither clifford !
bid him come amain , to say if that the bastard boys of york shall be the surety for their traitor father .
exit buckingham o neapolitan , outcast of naples , england bloody scourge !
the sons of york , thy betters in their birth , shall be their father bail , and bane to those that for my surety will refuse the boys !

enter clifford and young clifford and here comes clifford to deny their bail .
health and all happiness to my lord the king !
kneels i thank thee , clifford say , what news with thee ?
nay , do not fright us with an angry look , we are thy sovereign , clifford , kneel again , for thy mistaking so , we pardon thee .
this is my king , york , i do not mistake , but thou mistakest me much to think i do to bedlam with him !
is the man grown mad ?
ay , clifford , a bedlam and ambitious humour makes him oppose himself against his king .
he is a traitor , let him to the tower , and chop away that factious pate of his .
he is arrested , but will not obey , his sons , he says , shall give their words for him .
will you not , sons ?
ay , noble father , if our words will serve .
and if words will not , then our weapons shall .
why , what a brood of traitors have we here !
look in a glass , and call thy image so i am thy king , and thou a traitor .
call hither to the stake my two brave bears , that with the very shaking of their chains they may astonish these curs bid salisbury and warwick come to me .
enter the warwick and salisbury are these thy bears ?
we bait thy bears to death .
and manacle the in their chains , if thou darest bring them to the baiting place .
oft have i seen a hot cur run back and bite , because he was withheld , who , being suffer with the bear fell paw , hath clapp his tail between his legs and cried and such a piece of service will you do , if you oppose yourselves to match lord warwick .
hence , heap of wrath , foul indigested lump , as crooked in thy manners as thy shape !
nay , we shall heat you thoroughly anon .
take heed , lest by your heat you burn yourselves .
why , warwick , hath thy knee forgot to bow ?
old salisbury , shame to thy silver hair , thou mad misleader of thy son !
what , wilt thou on thy play the ruffian , and seek for sorrow with thy spectacles ?
o , where is faith ?
o , where is loyalty ?
if it be banish from the frosty head , where shall it find a harbour in the earth ?
wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war , and shame thine honourable age with blood ?
why art thou old , and experience ?
or wherefore dost abuse it , if thou hast it ?
for shame !
in duty bend thy knee to me that bows unto the grave with mickle age .
my lord , i have consider with myself the title of this most renowned duke , and in my conscience do repute his grace the rightful heir to england royal seat .
hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me ?
i have .
canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath ?
it is great sin to swear unto a sin , but greater sin to keep a sinful oath .
who can be bound by any solemn vow to do a murderous deed , to rob a man , to force a spotless virgin chastity , to reave the orphan of his patrimony , to wring the widow from her custom right , and have no other reason for this wrong but that he was bound by a solemn oath ?
a subtle traitor needs no sophister .
call buckingham , and bid him arm himself .
call buckingham , and all the friends thou hast , i am resolved for death or dignity .
the first i warrant thee , if dreams prove true .
you were best to go to bed and dream again , to keep thee from the tempest of the field .
i am resolved to bear a greater storm than any thou canst conjure up , and that i write upon thy burgonet , might i but know thee by thy household badge .
now , by my father badge , old nevil crest , the rampant bear chain to the ragged staff , this day i wear aloft my burgonet , as on a mountain top the cedar shows that keeps his leaves in spite of any storm , even to affright thee with the view thereof .
and from thy burgonet i rend thy bear and tread it under foot with all contempt , despite the that protects the bear .
and so to arms , victorious father , to quell the rebels and their complices .
fie !
charity , for shame !
speak not in spite , for you shall sup with jesu christ .
foul stigmatic , that more than thou canst tell .
if not in heaven , you surely sup in hell .

seeing his dead father o , let the vile world end , and the premised flames of the last day knit earth and heaven together !
now let the general trumpet blow his blast , particularities and petty sounds to cease !
wast thou ordain , dear father , to lose thy youth in peace , and to achieve the silver livery of advised age , and , in thy reverence and thy , thus to die in ruffian battle ?
even at this sight my heart is turn to stone and while is mine , it shall be stony .
york not our old men spares , no more will i their babes tears virginal shall be to me even as the dew to fire , and beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax .
henceforth i will not have to do with pity meet i an infant of the house of york , into as many gobbets will i cut it as wild medea young absyrtus did in cruelty will i seek out my fame .
come , thou new ruin of old clifford house as did aeneas old anchises bear , so bear i thee upon my manly shoulders , but then aeneas bare a living load , nothing so heavy as these woes of mine .
exit , bearing off his father enter richard and somerset to fight .
somerset is killed so , lie thou there , for underneath an alehouse ' paltry sign , the castle in saint alban , somerset hath made the wizard famous in his death .

you are slow , for shame , away !
can we outrun the heavens ?
good margaret , stay .
what are you made of ?
you nor fight nor fly now is it manhood , wisdom and defence , to give the enemy way , and to secure us by what we can , which can no more but fly .
alarum afar off if you be , we then should see the bottom of all our fortunes but if we haply scape , as well we may , if not through your neglect , we shall to london get , where you are loved and where this breach now in our fortunes made may readily be stopp .
young clifford but that my heart on future mischief set , i would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly but fly you must , uncurable discomfit reigns in the hearts of all our present parts .
away , for your relief !
and we will live to see their day and them our fortune give away , my lord , away !

enter york , richard , warwick , and soldiers , with drum and colours of salisbury , who can report of him , that winter lion , who in rage forgets aged contusions and all brush of time , and , like a gallant in the brow of youth , repairs him with occasion ?
this happy day is not itself , nor have we won one foot , if salisbury be lost .
my noble father , three times i holp him to his horse , three times bestrid him , thrice i led him off , persuaded him from any further act but still , where danger was , still there i met him , and like rich hangings in a homely house , so was his will in his old feeble body .
but , noble as he is , look where he comes .
enter salisbury now , by my sword , well hast thou fought , by the mass , so did we all .
i thank you , richard god knows how long it is i have to live , and it hath pleased him that three times you have defended me from imminent death .
well , lords , we have not got that which we have is not enough our foes are this time fled , being opposites of such repairing nature .
i know our safety is to follow them , for , as i hear , the king is fled to london , to call a present court of parliament .
let us pursue him ere the writs go forth .
what says lord warwick ?
shall we after them ?
after them !
nay , before them , if we can .
now , by my faith , lords , was a glorious day saint alban battle won by famous york shall be eternized in all age to come .

enter york , edward , richard , norfolk , montague , warwick , and soldiers i wonder how the king escaped our hands .
while we pursued the horsemen of the north , he slily stole away and left his men whereat the great lord of northumberland , whose warlike ears could never brook retreat , cheer up the drooping army , and himself , lord clifford and lord stafford , all abreast , charged our main battle front , and breaking in were by the swords of common soldiers slain .
lord stafford father , duke of buckingham , is either slain or wounded dangerously , i cleft his beaver with a downright blow that this is true , father , behold his blood .
and , brother , here the earl of wiltshire blood , whom i encounter as the battles join .
speak thou for me and tell them what i did .
throwing down somerset head richard hath best deserved of all my sons .
but is your grace dead , my lord of somerset ?
such hope have all the line of john of gaunt !
thus do i hope to shake king henry head .
and so do victorious prince of york , before i see thee seated in that throne which now the house of lancaster usurps , i vow by heaven these eyes shall never close .
this is the palace of the fearful king , and this the regal seat possess it , york , for this is thine and not king henry heirs ' assist me , then , sweet warwick , and i will , for hither we have broken in by force .
we all assist you , he that flies shall die .
thanks , gentle norfolk stay by me , my lords , and , soldiers , stay and lodge by me this night .
they go up and when the king comes , offer no violence , unless he seek to thrust you out perforce .
the queen this day here holds her parliament , but little thinks we shall be of her council by words or blows here let us win our right .
arm as we are , let stay within this house .
the bloody parliament shall this be call , unless plantagenet , duke of york , be king , and bashful henry deposed , whose cowardice hath made us to our enemies .
then leave me not , my lords , be resolute , i mean to take possession of my right .
neither the king , nor he that loves him best , the proudest he that holds up lancaster , dares stir a wing , if warwick shake his bells .
i plant plantagenet , root him up who dares resolve thee , richard , claim the english crown .

enter king henry vi , clifford , northumberland , westmoreland , exeter , and the rest my lords , look where the sturdy rebel sits , even in the chair of state belike he means , back by the power of warwick , that false peer , to aspire unto the crown and reign as king .
earl of northumberland , he slew thy father .
and thine , lord clifford , and you both have vow revenge on him , his sons , his favourites and his friends .
if i be not , heavens be revenged on me !
the hope thereof makes clifford mourn in steel .
what , shall we suffer this ?
let pluck him down my heart for anger burns , i can not brook it .
be patient , gentle earl of westmoreland .
patience is for poltroons , such as he he durst not sit there , had your father lived .
my gracious lord , here in the parliament let us assail the family of york .
well hast thou spoken , cousin be it so .
ah , know you not the city favours them , and they have troops of soldiers at their beck ?
but when the duke is slain , they quickly fly .
far be the thought of this from henry heart , to make a shambles of the !
cousin of exeter , frowns , words and threats shall be the war that henry means to use .
thou factious duke of york , descend my throne , and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet , i am thy sovereign .
i am thine .
for shame , come down he made thee duke of york .
was my inheritance , as the earldom was .
thy father was a traitor to the crown .
exeter , thou art a traitor to the crown in following this usurping henry .
whom should he follow but his natural king ?
true , clifford , and that richard duke of york .
and shall i stand , and thou sit in my throne ?
it must and shall be so content thyself .
be duke of lancaster , let him be king .
he is both king and duke of lancaster , and that the lord of westmoreland shall maintain .
and warwick shall disprove it .
you forget that we are those which chased you from the field and slew your fathers , and with colours spread march through the city to the palace gates .
yes , warwick , i remember it to my grief , and , by his soul , thou and thy house shall rue it .
plantagenet , of thee and these thy sons , thy kinsman and thy friends , i have more lives than drops of blood were in my father veins .
urge it no more , lest that , instead of words , i send thee , warwick , such a messenger as shall revenge his death before i stir .
poor clifford !
how i scorn his worthless threats !
will you we show our title to the crown ?
if not , our swords shall plead it in the field .
what title hast thou , traitor , to the crown ?
thy father was , as thou art , duke of york , thy grandfather , roger mortimer , earl of march i am the son of henry the fifth , who made the dauphin and the french to stoop and seized upon their towns and provinces .
talk not of france , sith thou hast lost it all .
the lord protector lost it , and not i when i was crown i was but nine months old .
you are old enough now , and yet , methinks , you lose .
father , tear the crown from the usurper head .
sweet father , do so , set it on your head .
good brother , as thou lovest and honourest arms , let fight it out and not stand cavilling thus .
sound drums and trumpets , and the king will fly .
sons , peace !
peace , thou !
and give king henry leave to speak .
plantagenet shall speak first hear him , lords , and be you silent and attentive too , for he that interrupts him shall not live .
thou that i will leave my kingly throne , wherein my grandsire and my father sat ?
no first shall war unpeople this my realm , ay , and their colours , often borne in france , and now in england to our heart great sorrow , shall be my .
why faint you , lords ?
my title good , and better far than his .
prove it , henry , and thou shalt be king .
henry the fourth by conquest got the crown .
was by rebellion against his king .
aside i know not what to say , my title tell me , may not a king adopt an heir ?
what then ?
an if he may , then am i lawful king , for richard , in the view of many lords , resign the crown to henry the fourth , whose heir my father was , and i am his .
he rose against him , being his sovereign , and made him to resign his crown perforce .
suppose , my lords , he did it unconstrain , think you prejudicial to his crown ?
no , for he could not so resign his crown but that the next heir should succeed and reign .
art thou against us , duke of exeter ?
his is the right , and therefore pardon me .
why whisper you , my lords , and answer not ?
my conscience tells me he is lawful king .
aside all will revolt from me , and turn to him .
plantagenet , for all the claim thou , think not that henry shall be so deposed .
deposed he shall be , in despite of all .
thou art deceived is not thy southern power , of essex , norfolk , suffolk , nor of kent , which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud , can set the duke up in despite of me .
king henry , be thy title right or wrong , lord clifford vows to fight in thy defence may that ground gape and swallow me alive , where i shall kneel to him that slew my father !
o clifford , how thy words revive my heart !
henry of lancaster , resign thy crown .
what mutter you , or what conspire you , lords ?
do right unto this princely duke of york , or i will fill the house with armed men , and over the chair of state , where now he sits , write up his title with usurping blood .
he stamps with his foot and the soldiers show themselves my lord of warwick , hear me but one word let me for this my reign as king .
confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs , and thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest .
i am content richard plantagenet , enjoy the kingdom after my decease .
what wrong is this unto the prince your son !
what good is this to england and himself !
base , fearful and despairing henry !
how hast thou injured both thyself and us !
i can not stay to hear these articles .
nor i .
come , cousin , let us tell the queen these news .
farewell , and degenerate king , in whose cold blood no spark of honour bides .
be thou a prey unto the house of york , and die in bands for this unmanly deed !
in dreadful war mayst thou be overcome , or live in peace abandon and despised !
exeunt northumberland , clifford , and westmoreland turn this way , henry , and regard them not .
they seek revenge and therefore will not yield .
ah , exeter !
why should you sigh , my lord ?
not for myself , lord warwick , but my son , whom i unnaturally shall disinherit .
but be it as it may i here entail the crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever , conditionally , that here thou take an oath to cease this civil war , and , whilst i live , to honour me as thy king and sovereign , and neither by treason nor hostility to seek to put me down and reign thyself .
this oath i willingly take and will perform .
long live king henry !
plantagenet embrace him .
and long live thou and these thy forward sons !
now york and lancaster are reconciled .
accursed be he that seeks to make them foes !

enter queen margaret and prince edward here comes the queen , whose looks bewray her anger i steal away .
exeter , so will i .
nay , go not from me , i will follow thee .
be patient , gentle queen , and i will stay .
who can be patient in such extremes ?
ah , wretched man !
would i had died a maid and never seen thee , never borne thee son , seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus ?
hadst thou but loved him half so well as i , or felt that pain which i did for him once , or nourish him as i did with my blood , thou wouldst have left thy dearest there , rather than have that savage duke thine heir and disinherited thine only son .
father , you can not disinherit me if you be king , why should not i succeed ?
pardon me , margaret , pardon me , sweet son the earl of warwick and the duke enforced me .
enforced thee !
art thou king , and wilt be forced ?
i shame to hear thee speak .
ah , timorous wretch !
thou hast undone thyself , thy son and me , and given unto the house of york such head as thou shalt reign but by their sufferance .
to entail him and his heirs unto the crown , what is it , but to make thy sepulchre and creep into it far before thy time ?
warwick is chancellor and the lord of calais , stern falconbridge commands the narrow seas , the duke is made protector of the realm , and yet shalt thou be safe ?
such safety finds the trembling lamb environed with wolves .
had i been there , which am a silly woman , the soldiers should have toss me on their pikes before i would have granted to that act .
but thou thy life before thine honour and seeing thou dost , i here divorce myself both from thy table , henry , and thy bed , until that act of parliament be repeal whereby my son is disinherited .
the northern lords that have forsworn thy colours will follow mine , if once they see them spread , and spread they shall be , to thy foul disgrace and utter ruin of the house of york .
thus do i leave thee .
come , son , let away , our army is ready , come , we after them .
stay , gentle margaret , and hear me speak .
thou hast spoke too much already get thee gone .
gentle son edward , thou wilt stay with me ?
ay , to be murder by his enemies .
when i return with victory from the field i see your grace till then i follow her .
come , son , away , we may not linger thus .
exeunt queen margaret and prince edward poor queen !
how love to me and to her son hath made her break out into terms of rage !
revenged may she be on that hateful duke , whose haughty spirit , winged with desire , will cost my crown , and like an empty eagle tire on the flesh of me and of my son !
the loss of those three lords torments my heart i write unto them and entreat them fair .
come , cousin you shall be the messenger .
and i , i hope , shall reconcile them all .
exeunt scene ii .
sandal castle .
enter richard , edward , and montague brother , though i be youngest , give me leave .
no , i can better play the orator .
but i have reasons strong and forcible .
enter york why , how now , sons and brother !
at a strife ?
what is your quarrel ?
how began it first ?
no quarrel , but a slight contention .
about what ?
about that which concerns your grace and us , the crown of england , father , which is yours .
mine boy ?
not till king henry be dead .
your right depends not on his life or death .
now you are heir , therefore enjoy it now by giving the house of lancaster leave to breathe , it will outrun you , father , in the end .
i took an oath that he should quietly reign .
but for a kingdom any oath may be broken i would break a thousand oaths to reign one year .
no , god forbid your grace should be forsworn .
i shall be , if i claim by open war .
i prove the contrary , if you hear me speak .
thou canst not , son , it is impossible .
an oath is of no moment , being not took before a true and lawful magistrate , that hath authority over him that swears henry had none , but did usurp the place , then , seeing was he that made you to depose , your oath , my lord , is vain and frivolous .
therefore , to arms !
and , father , do but think how sweet a thing it is to wear a crown , within whose circuit is elysium and all that poets feign of bliss and joy .
why do we finger thus ?
i can not rest until the white rose that i wear be dyed even in the lukewarm blood of henry heart .
richard , enough , i will be king , or die .
brother , thou shalt to london presently , and whet on warwick to this enterprise .
thou , richard , shalt to the duke of norfolk , and tell him privily of our intent .
you edward , shall unto my lord cobham , with whom the kentishmen will willingly rise in them i trust , for they are soldiers , witty , courteous , liberal , full of spirit .
while you are thus employ , what resteth more , but that i seek occasion how to rise , and yet the king not privy to my drift , nor any of the house of lancaster ?
enter a messenger but , stay what news ?
why comest thou in such post ?
the queen with all the northern earls and lords intend here to besiege you in your castle she is hard by with twenty thousand men , and therefore fortify your hold , my lord .
ay , with my sword .
what !
thou that we fear them ?
edward and richard , you shall stay with me , my brother montague shall post to london let noble warwick , cobham , and the rest , whom we have left protectors of the king , with powerful policy strengthen themselves , and trust not simple henry nor his oaths .
brother , i go , i win them , fear it not and thus most humbly i do take my leave .
exit enter john mortimer and hugh mortimer sir john and sir hugh mortimer , mine uncles , you are come to sandal in a happy hour , the army of the queen mean to besiege us .
she shall not need , we meet her in the field .
what , with five thousand men ?
ay , with five hundred , father , for a need a woman general , what should we fear ?
a march afar off i hear their drums let set our men in order , and issue forth and bid them battle straight .
five men to twenty !
though the odds be great , i doubt not , uncle , of our victory .
many a battle have i won in france , when as the enemy hath been ten to one why should i not now have the like success ?

and i , my lord , will bear him company .
soldiers , away with him !
ah , clifford , murder not this innocent child , lest thou be hated both of god and man !
exit , dragged off by soldiers how now !
is he dead already ?
or is it fear that makes him close his eyes ?
i open them .
so looks the lion the wretch that trembles under his devouring paws , and so he walks , insulting his prey , and so he comes , to rend his limbs asunder .
ah , gentle clifford , kill me with thy sword , and not with such a cruel threatening look .
sweet clifford , hear me speak before i die .
i am too mean a subject for thy wrath be thou revenged on men , and let me live .
in vain thou , poor boy , my father blood hath stopp the passage where thy words should enter .
then let my father blood open it again he is a man , and , clifford , cope with him .
had thy brethren here , their lives and thine were not revenge sufficient for me , no , if i digg up thy forefathers ' graves and hung their rotten coffins up in chains , it could not slake mine ire , nor ease my heart .
the sight of any of the house of york is as a fury to torment my soul , and till i root out their accursed line and leave not one alive , i live in hell .
therefore lifting his hand o , let me pray before i take my death !
to thee i pray , sweet clifford , pity me !
such pity as my rapier point affords .
i never did thee harm why wilt thou slay me ?
thy father hath .
but was ere i was born .
thou hast one son , for his sake pity me , lest in revenge thereof , sith god is just , he be as miserably slain as i .
ah , let me live in prison all my days , and when i give occasion of offence , then let me die , for now thou hast no cause .
no cause !
thy father slew my father , therefore , die .
stabs him di faciant laudis summa sit ista tuae !
dies plantagenet !
i come , plantagenet !
and this thy son blood cleaving to my blade shall rust upon my weapon , till thy blood , congeal with this , do make me wipe off both .

my sons , god knows what hath bechanced them but this i know , they have demean themselves like men born to renown by life or death .
three times did richard make a lane to me .
and thrice cried , father !
fight it out ! '
and full as oft came edward to my side , with purple falchion , painted to the hilt in blood of those that had encounter him and when the hardiest warriors did retire , richard cried !
and give no foot of ground ! '
and cried ' a crown , or else a glorious tomb !
a sceptre , or an earthly sepulchre ! '
with this , we charged again but , out , alas !
we bodged again , as i have seen a swan with bootless labour swim against the tide and spend her strength with waves .
a short alarum within ah , hark !
the fatal followers do pursue , and i am faint and can not fly their fury and were i strong , i would not shun their fury the sands are number that make up my life , here must i stay , and here my life must end .
enter queen margaret , clifford , northumberland , prince edward , and soldiers come , bloody clifford , rough northumberland , i dare your quenchless fury to more rage i am your butt , and i abide your shot .
yield to our mercy , proud plantagenet .
ay , to such mercy as his ruthless arm , with downright payment , show unto my father .
now phaethon hath tumbled from his car , and made an evening at the noontide prick .
my ashes , as the phoenix , may bring forth a bird that will revenge upon you all and in that hope i throw mine eyes to heaven , scorning you can afflict me with .
why come you not ?
what !
multitudes , and fear ?
so cowards fight when they can fly no further , so doves do peck the falcon piercing talons , so desperate thieves , all hopeless of their lives , breathe out invectives the officers .
o clifford , but bethink thee once again , and in thy thought my former time , and , if though canst for blushing , view this face , and bite thy tongue , that slanders him with cowardice whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this !
i will not bandy with thee word for word , but buckle with thee blows , twice two for one .
hold , valiant clifford !
for a thousand causes i would prolong awhile the traitor life .
wrath makes him deaf speak thou , northumberland .
hold , clifford !
do not honour him so much to prick thy finger , though to wound his heart what valour were it , when a cur doth grin , for one to thrust his hand between his teeth , when he might spurn him with his foot away ?
it is war prize to take all vantages , and ten to one is no impeach of valour .
they lay hands on york , who struggles ay , ay , so strives the woodcock with the gin .
so doth the cony struggle in the net .
so triumph thieves upon their conquer booty , so true men yield , with robbers so .
what would your grace have done unto him now ?
brave warriors , clifford and northumberland , come , make him stand upon this molehill here , that raught at mountains with outstretched arms , yet parted but the shadow with his hand .
what !
was it you that would be england king ?
you that revell in our parliament , and made a preachment of your high descent ?
where are your mess of sons to back you now ?
the wanton edward , and the lusty george ?
and where that valiant prodigy , dicky your boy , that with his grumbling voice was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies ?
or , with the rest , where is your darling rutland ?
look , york i stain this napkin with the blood that valiant clifford , with his rapier point , made issue from the bosom of the boy , and if thine eyes can water for his death , i give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal .
alas poor york !
but that i hate thee deadly , i should lament thy miserable state .
i prithee , grieve , to make me merry , york .
what , hath thy fiery heart so parch thine entrails that not a tear can fall for rutland death ?
why art thou patient , man ?
thou shouldst be mad , and i , to make thee mad , do mock thee thus .
stamp , rave , and fret , that i may sing and dance .
thou wouldst be fee , i see , to make me sport york can not speak , unless he wear a crown .
a crown for york !
and , lords , bow low to him hold you his hands , whilst i do set it on .
putting a paper crown on his head ay , marry , sir , now looks he like a king !
ay , this is he that took king henry chair , and this is he was his adopted heir .
but how is it that great plantagenet is crown so soon , and broke his solemn oath ?
as i bethink me , you should not be king till our king henry had shook hands with death .
and will you pale your head in henry glory , and rob his temples of the diadem , now in his life , against your holy oath ?
o , is a fault too too unpardonable !
off with the crown , and with the crown his head , and , whilst we breathe , take time to do him dead .
that is my office , for my father sake .
nay , stay , lets hear the orisons he makes .
of france , but worse than wolves of france , whose tongue more poisons than the adder tooth !
how is it in thy sex to triumph , like an amazonian trull , upon their woes whom fortune captivates !
but that thy face is , , unchanging , made impudent with use of evil deeds , i would assay , proud queen , to make thee blush .
to tell thee whence thou camest , of whom derived , were shame enough to shame thee , wert thou not shameless .
thy father bears the type of king of naples , of both the sicils and jerusalem , yet not so wealthy as an english yeoman .
hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult ?
it needs not , nor it boots thee not , proud queen , unless the adage must be verified , that beggars mounted run their horse to death .
is beauty that doth oft make women proud , but , god he knows , thy share thereof is small is virtue that doth make them most admired , the contrary doth make thee wonder at is government that makes them seem divine , the want thereof makes thee abominable thou art as opposite to every good as the antipodes are unto us , or as the south to the septentrion .
o tiger heart wrapt in a woman hide !
how couldst thou drain the of the child , to bid the father wipe his eyes withal , and yet be seen to bear a woman face ?
women are soft , mild , pitiful and flexible , thou stern , obdurate , flinty , rough , remorseless .
thou me rage ?
why , now thou hast thy wish wouldst have me weep ?
why , now thou hast thy will for raging wind blows up incessant showers , and when the rage allays , the rain begins .
these tears are my sweet rutland obsequies and every drop cries vengeance for his death , thee , fell clifford , and thee , false frenchwoman .
beshrew me , but his passion moves me so that hardly can i cheque my eyes from tears .
that face of his the hungry cannibals would not have touch , would not have stain with blood but you are more inhuman , more inexorable , o , ten times more , than tigers of hyrcania .
see , ruthless queen , a hapless father tears this cloth thou in blood of my sweet boy , and i with tears do wash the blood away .
keep thou the napkin , and go boast of this and if thou the heavy story right , upon my soul , the hearers will shed tears , yea even my foes will shed tears , and say , it was a piteous deed ! '
there , take the crown , and , with the crown , my curse , and in thy need such comfort come to thee as now i reap at thy too cruel hand !
clifford , take me from the world my soul to heaven , my blood upon your heads !
had he been to all my kin , i should not for my life but weep with him .
to see how inly sorrow gripes his soul .
what , , my lord northumberland ?
think but upon the wrong he did us all , and that will quickly dry thy melting tears .
here for my oath , here for my father death .
stabbing him and here to right our king .
stabbing him open thy gate of mercy , gracious god !
my soul flies through these wounds to seek out thee .
dies off with his head , and set it on york gates , so york may overlook the town of york .

enter edward , richard , and their power i wonder how our princely father , or whether he be away or no from clifford and northumberland pursuit had he been , we should have heard the news , had he been slain , we should have heard the news , or had he , methinks we should have heard the happy tidings of his good escape .
how fares my brother ?
why is he so sad ?
i can not joy , until i be resolved where our right valiant father is become .
i saw him in the battle range about , and watch him how he singled clifford forth .
methought he bore him in the thickest troop as doth a lion in a herd of neat , or as a bear , encompass round with dogs , who having pinch a few and made them cry , the rest stand all aloof , and bark at him .
so fared our father with his enemies , so fled his enemies my warlike father methinks , is prize enough to be his son .
see how the morning opes her golden gates , and takes her farewell of the glorious sun !
how well resembles it the prime of youth , trimm like a younker prancing to his love !

three glorious suns , each one a perfect sun , not separated with the racking clouds , but sever in a pale sky .
see , see !
they join , embrace , and seem to kiss , as if they vow some league inviolable now are they but one lamp , one light , one sun .
in this the heaven figures some event .
is wondrous strange , the like yet never heard of .
i think it cites us , brother , to the field , that we , the sons of brave plantagenet , each one already blazing by our meeds , should notwithstanding join our lights together and the earth as this the world .
it bodes , henceforward will i bear upon my target three suns .
nay , bear three daughters by your leave i speak it , you love the breeder better than the male .
enter a messenger but what art thou , whose heavy looks foretell some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue ?
ah , one that was a woful when as the noble duke of york was slain , your princely father and my loving lord !
o , speak no more , for i have heard too much .
say how he died , for i will hear it all .
environed he was with many foes , and stood against them , as the hope of troy against the greeks that would have enter troy .
but hercules himself must yield to odds , and many strokes , though with a little axe , hew down and fell the oak .
by many hands your father was subdued , but only slaughter by the ireful arm of unrelenting clifford and the queen , who crown the gracious duke in high despite , laugh in his face , and when with grief he wept , the ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks a napkin steeped in the harmless blood of sweet young rutland , by rough clifford slain and after many scorns , many foul taunts , they took his head , and on the gates of york they set the same , and there it doth remain , the saddest spectacle that i view .
sweet duke of york , our prop to lean upon , now thou art gone , we have no staff , no stay .
o clifford , boisterous clifford !
thou hast slain the flower of europe for his chivalry , and treacherously hast thou vanquish him , for hand to hand he would have vanquish thee .
now my soul palace is become a prison ah , would she break from hence , that this my body might in the ground be closed up in rest !
for never henceforth shall i joy again , never , o never shall i see more joy !
i can not weep , for all my body moisture scarce serves to quench my heart nor can my tongue unload my heart great burthen , for selfsame wind that i should speak withal is kindling coals that fires all my breast , and burns me up with flames that tears would quench .
to weep is to make less the depth of grief tears then for babes , blows and revenge for me richard , i bear thy name , i venge thy death , or die renowned by attempting it .
his name that valiant duke hath left with thee , his dukedom and his chair with me is left .
nay , if thou be that princely eagle bird , show thy descent by gazing the sun for chair and dukedom , throne and kingdom say , either that is thine , or else thou wert not his .
march .
enter warwick , montague , and their army how now , fair lords !
what fare ?
what news abroad ?
great lord of warwick , if we should recount our baleful news , and at each word deliverance stab poniards in our flesh till all were told , the words would add more anguish than the wounds .
o valiant lord , the duke of york is slain !
o warwick , warwick !
that plantagenet , which held three dearly as his soul redemption , is by the stern lord clifford done to death .
ten days ago i drown these news in tears , and now , to add more measure to your woes , i come to tell you things sith then .
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought , where your brave father breathed his latest gasp , tidings , as swiftly as the posts could run , were brought me of your loss and his depart .
i , then in london keeper of the king , muster my soldiers , gather flocks of friends , and very well appointed , as i thought , march toward saint alban to intercept the queen , bearing the king in my behalf along , for by my scouts i was advertised that she was coming with a full intent to dash our late decree in parliament touching king henry oath and your succession .
short tale to make , we at saint alban met our battles join , and both sides fiercely fought but whether was the coldness of the king , who look full gently on his warlike queen , that robb my soldiers of their heated spleen , or whether was report of her success , or more than common fear of clifford rigour , who thunders to his captives blood and death , i can not judge but to conclude with truth , their weapons like to lightning came and went , our soldiers ' , like the lazy flight , or like an idle thresher with a flail , fell gently down , as if they struck their friends .
i cheer them up with justice of our cause , with promise of high pay and great rewards but all in vain , they had no heart to fight , and we in them no hope to win the day , so that we fled , the king unto the queen , lord george your brother , norfolk and myself , in haste , , are come to join with you for in the marches here we heard you were , making another head to fight again .
where is the duke of norfolk , gentle warwick ?
and when came george from burgundy to england ?
some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers , and for your brother , he was lately sent from your kind aunt , duchess of burgundy , with aid of soldiers to this needful war .
was odds , belike , when valiant warwick fled oft have i heard his praises in pursuit , but till now his scandal of retire .
nor now my scandal , richard , dost thou hear , for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine can pluck the diadem from faint henry head , and wring the awful sceptre from his fist , were he as famous and as bold in war as he is famed for mildness , peace , and prayer .
i know it well , lord warwick , blame me not is love i bear thy glories makes me speak .
but in this troublous time what to be done ?
shall we go throw away our coats of steel , and wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns , numbering our with our beads ?
or shall we on the helmets of our foes tell our devotion with revengeful arms ?
if for the last , say ay , and to it , lords .
why , therefore warwick came to seek you out , and therefore comes my brother montague .
attend me , lords .
the proud insulting queen , with clifford and the haught northumberland , and of their feather many more proud birds , have wrought the king like wax .
he swore consent to your succession , his oath enrolled in the parliament , and now to london all the crew are gone , to frustrate both his oath and what beside may make against the house of lancaster .
their power , i think , is thirty thousand strong now , if the help of norfolk and myself , with all the friends that thou , brave earl of march , amongst the loving welshmen canst procure , will but amount to five and twenty thousand , why , via !
to london will we march amain , and once again bestride our foaming steeds , and once again cry upon our foes ! '
but never once again turn back and fly .
ay , now methinks i hear great warwick speak may he live to see a sunshine day , that cries , ' if warwick bid him stay .
lord warwick , on thy shoulder will i lean , and when thou as god forbid the hour ! must edward fall , which peril heaven forfend !
no longer earl of march , but duke of york the next degree is england royal throne , for king of england shalt thou be proclaim in every borough as we pass along , and he that throws not up his cap for joy shall for the fault make forfeit of his head .
king edward , valiant richard , montague , stay we no longer , dreaming of renown , but sound the trumpets , and about our task .
then , clifford , were thy heart as hard as steel , as thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds , i come to pierce it , or to give thee mine .
then strike up drums god and saint george for us !
enter a messenger how now !
what news ?
the duke of norfolk sends you word by me , the queen is coming with a puissant host , and craves your company for speedy counsel .
why then it sorts , brave warriors , let away .
exeunt scene ii .
before york .
flourish .
enter king henry vi , queen margaret , prince edward , clifford , and northumberland , with drum and trumpets welcome , my lord , to this brave town of york .
yonder the head of that that sought to be encompass with your crown doth not the object cheer your heart , my lord ?
ay , as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck to see this sight , it irks my very soul .
withhold revenge , dear god !
is not my fault , nor wittingly have i infringed my vow .
my gracious liege , this too much lenity and harmful pity must be laid aside .
to whom do lions cast their gentle looks ?
not to the beast that would usurp their den .
whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick ?
not his that spoils her young before her face .
who the lurking serpent mortal sting ?
not he that sets his foot upon her back .
the smallest worm will turn being trodden on , and doves will peck in safeguard of their brood .
ambitious york doth level at thy crown , thou smiling while he knit his angry brows he , but a duke , would have his son a king , and raise his issue , like a loving sire , thou , being a king , blest with a goodly son , didst yield consent to disinherit him , which argued thee a most unloving father .
unreasonable creatures feed their young , and though man face be fearful to their eyes , yet , in protection of their tender ones , who hath not seen them , even with those wings which sometime they have used with fearful flight , make war with him that climb unto their nest , offer their own lives in their young defence ?
for shame , my liege , make them your precedent !
were it not pity that this goodly boy should lose his birthright by his father fault , and long hereafter say unto his child , my and his grandsire got my careless father fondly gave away ' ?
ah , what a shame were this !
look on the boy , and let his manly face , which promiseth successful fortune , steel thy melting heart to hold thine own and leave thine own with him .
full well hath clifford play the orator , inferring arguments of mighty force .
but , clifford , tell me , didst thou never hear that things had ever bad success ?
and happy always was it for that son whose father for his hoarding went to hell ?
i leave my son my virtuous deeds behind , and would my father had left me no more !
for all the rest is held at such a rate as brings a more care to keep than in possession and jot of pleasure .
ah , cousin york !
would thy best friends did know how it doth grieve me that thy head is here !
my lord , cheer up your spirits our foes are nigh , and this soft courage makes your followers faint .
you promised knighthood to our forward son unsheathe your sword , and dub him presently .
edward , kneel down .
edward plantagenet , arise a knight , and learn this lesson , draw thy sword in right .
my gracious father , by your kingly leave , i draw it as apparent to the crown , and in that quarrel use it to the death .
why , that is spoken like a toward prince .
enter a messenger royal commanders , be in readiness for with a band of thirty thousand men comes warwick , backing of the duke of york , and in the towns , as they do march along , proclaims him king , and many fly to him darraign your battle , for they are at hand .
i would your highness would depart the field the queen hath best success when you are absent .
ay , good my lord , and leave us to our fortune .
why , that my fortune too , therefore i stay .
be it with resolution then to fight .
my royal father , cheer these noble lords and hearten those that fight in your defence unsheathe your sword , good father , cry george ! '
march .
enter edward , george , richard , warwick , norfolk , montague , and soldiers now , perjured henry !
wilt thou kneel for grace , and set thy diadem upon my head , or bide the mortal fortune of the field ?
go , rate thy minions , proud insulting boy !
becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms before thy sovereign and thy lawful king ?
i am his king , and he should bow his knee , i was adopted heir by his consent since when , his oath is broke , for , as i hear , you , that are king , though he do wear the crown , have caused him , by new act of parliament , to blot out me , and put his own son in .
and reason too who should succeed the father but the son ?
are you there , butcher ?
o , i can not speak !
ay , , here i stand to answer thee , or any he the proudest of thy sort .
was you that kill young rutland , was it not ?
ay , and old york , and yet not satisfied .
for god sake , lords , give signal to the fight .
what thou , henry , wilt thou yield the crown ?
why , how now , warwick !
dare you speak ?
when you and i met at saint alban last , your legs did better service than your hands .
then was my turn to fly , and now is thine .
you said so much before , and yet you fled .
was not your valour , clifford , drove me thence .
no , nor your manhood that durst make you stay .
northumberland , i hold thee reverently .
break off the parley , for scarce i can refrain the execution of my heart upon that clifford , that cruel .
i slew thy father , thou him a child ?
ay , like a dastard and a treacherous coward , as thou didst kill our tender brother rutland , but ere sunset i make thee curse the deed .
have done with words , my lords , and hear me speak .
defy them then , or else hold close thy lips .
i prithee , give no limits to my tongue i am a king , and privileged to speak .
my liege , the wound that bred this meeting here can not be cured by words , therefore be still .
then , executioner , unsheathe thy sword by him that made us all , i am resolved that clifford manhood lies upon his tongue .
say , henry , shall i have my right , or no ?
a thousand men have broke their fasts , that shall dine unless thou yield the crown .
if thou deny , their blood upon thy head , for york in justice puts his armour on .
if that be right which warwick says is right , there is no wrong , but every thing is right .
whoever got thee , there thy mother stands , for , well i wot , thou hast thy mother tongue .
but thou art neither like thy sire nor dam , but like a foul stigmatic , mark by the destinies to be avoided , as venom toads , or lizards ' dreadful stings .
iron of naples hid with english gilt , whose father bears the title of a king , as if a channel should be call the sea , shamest thou not , knowing whence thou art extraught , to let thy tongue detect thy heart ?
a wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns , to make this shameless callet know herself .
helen of greece was fairer far than thou , although thy husband may be menelaus , and was agamemnon brother wrong by that false woman , as this king by thee .
his father revell in the heart of france , and tamed the king , and made the dauphin stoop , and had he match according to his state , he might have kept that glory to this day , but when he took a beggar to his bed , and graced thy poor sire with his , even then that sunshine brew a shower for him , that wash his father fortunes forth of france , and heap sedition on his crown at home .
for what hath broach this tumult but thy pride ?
hadst thou been meek , our title still had slept , and we , in pity of the gentle king , had slipp our claim until another age .
but when we saw our sunshine made thy spring , and that thy summer bred us no increase , we set the axe to thy usurping root , and though the edge hath something hit ourselves , yet , know thou , since we have begun to strike , we never leave till we have hewn thee down , or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods .
and , in this resolution , i defy thee , not willing any longer conference , since thou deniest the gentle king to speak .
sound trumpets !
let our bloody colours wave !
and either victory , or else a grave .
stay , edward .
no , wrangling woman , we no longer stay these words will cost ten thousand lives this day .

or strike , ungentle death !
for this world frowns , and edward sun is clouded .
how now , my lord !
what hap ?
what hope of good ?
enter george our hap is loss , our hope but sad despair , our ranks are broke , and ruin follows us what counsel give you ?
whither shall we fly ?
bootless is flight , they follow us with wings , and weak we are and can not shun pursuit .
enter richard ah , warwick , why hast thou withdrawn thyself ?
thy brother blood the thirsty earth hath drunk , broach with the steely point of clifford lance , and in the very pangs of death he cried , like to a dismal clangour heard from far , , revenge !
brother , revenge my death ! '
so , underneath the belly of their steeds , that stain their fetlocks in his smoking blood , the noble gentleman gave up the ghost .
then let the earth be drunken with our blood i kill my horse , because i will not fly .
why stand we like women here , wailing our losses , whiles the foe doth rage , and look upon , as if the tragedy were play in jest by counterfeiting actors ?
here on my knee i vow to god above , i never pause again , never stand still , till either death hath closed these eyes of mine or fortune given me measure of revenge .
o warwick , i do bend my knee with thine , and in this vow do chain my soul to thine !
and , ere my knee rise from the earth cold face , i throw my hands , mine eyes , my heart to thee , thou setter up and plucker down of kings , beseeching thee , if with they will it stands that to my foes this body must be prey , yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope , and give sweet passage to my sinful soul !
now , lords , take leave until we meet again , it be , in heaven or in earth .
brother , give me thy hand , and , gentle warwick , let me embrace thee in my weary arms i , that did never weep , now melt with woe that winter should cut off our so .
away , away !
once more , sweet lords farewell .
yet let us all together to our troops , and give them leave to fly that will not stay , and call them pillars that will stand to us , and , if we thrive , promise them such rewards as victors wear at the olympian games this may plant courage in their quailing breasts , for yet is hope of life and victory .
forslow no longer , make we hence amain .

exeunt scene another part of the field .
alarum .
enter king henry vi alone this battle fares like to the morning war , when dying clouds contend with growing light , what time the shepherd , blowing of his nails , can neither call it perfect day nor night .
now sways it this way , like a mighty sea forced by the tide to combat with the wind , now sways it that way , like the selfsame sea forced to retire by fury of the wind sometime the flood prevails , and then the wind , now one the better , then another best , both tugging to be victors , breast to breast , yet neither conqueror nor conquered so is the equal of this fell war .
here on this molehill will i sit me down .
to whom god will , there be the victory !
for margaret my queen , and clifford too , have chid me from the battle , swearing both they prosper best of all when i am thence .
would i were dead !
if god good will were so , for what is in this world but grief and woe ?
o god !
methinks it were a happy life , to be no better than a homely swain , to sit upon a hill , as i do now , to carve out dials quaintly , point by point , thereby to see the minutes how they run , how many make the hour full complete , how many hours bring about the day , how many days will finish up the year , how many years a mortal man may live .
when this is known , then to divide the times so many hours must i tend my flock , so many hours must i take my rest , so many hours must i contemplate , so many hours must i sport myself , so many days my ewes have been with young , so many weeks ere the poor fools will ean so many years ere i shall shear the fleece so minutes , hours , days , months , and years , pass over to the end they were created , would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave .
ah , what a life were this !
how sweet !
how lovely !
gives not the a sweeter shade to shepherds looking on their silly sheep , than doth a rich embroider canopy to kings that fear their subjects ' treachery ?
o , yes , it doth , a it doth .
and to conclude , the shepherd homely curds , his cold thin drink out of his leather bottle .
his wonted sleep under a fresh tree shade , all which secure and sweetly he enjoys , is far beyond a prince delicates , his viands sparkling in a golden cup , his body couched in a curious bed , when care , mistrust , and treason waits on him .

this man , whom hand to hand i slew in fight , may be possessed with some store of crowns , and i , that haply take them from him now , may yet ere night yield both my life and them to some man else , as this dead man doth me .
who this ?
o god !
it is my father face , whom in this conflict i unwares have kill .
o heavy times , begetting such events !
from london by the king was i press forth , my father , being the earl of warwick man , came on the part of york , press by his master , and i , who at his hands received my life , him have by my hands of life bereaved him .
pardon me , god , i knew not what i did !
and pardon , father , for i knew not thee !
my tears shall wipe away these bloody marks , and no more words till they have flow their fill .
o piteous spectacle !
o bloody times !
whiles lions war and battle for their dens , poor harmless lambs abide their enmity .
weep , wretched man , i aid thee tear for tear , and let our hearts and eyes , like civil war , be blind with tears , and break with grief .
enter a father that has killed his son , bringing in the body thou that so stoutly hast resisted me , give me thy gold , if thou hast any gold for i have bought it with an hundred blows .
but let me see is this our foeman face ?
ah , no , no , no , it is mine only son !
ah , boy , if any life be left in thee , throw up thine eye !
see , see what showers arise , blown with the windy tempest of my heart , upon thy words , that kill mine eye and heart !
o , pity , god , this miserable age !
what stratagems , how fell , how butcherly , erroneous , mutinous and unnatural , this deadly quarrel daily doth beget !
o boy , thy father gave thee life too soon , and hath bereft thee of thy life too late !
woe above woe !
grief more than common grief !
o that my death would stay these ruthful deeds !
o pity , pity , gentle heaven , pity !
the red rose and the white are on his face , the fatal colours of our striving houses the one his purple blood right well resembles , the other his pale cheeks , methinks , presenteth wither one rose , and let the other flourish , if you contend , a thousand lives must wither .
how will my mother for a father death take on with me and be satisfied !
how will my wife for slaughter of my son shed seas of tears and be satisfied !
how will the country for these woful chances misthink the king and not be satisfied !
was ever son so rued a father death ?
was ever father so bemoan his son ?
was ever king so grieved for subjects ' woe ?
much is your sorrow , mine ten times so much .
i bear thee hence , where i may weep my fill .
exit with the body these arms of mine shall be thy , my heart , sweet boy , shall be thy sepulchre , for from my heart thine image shall go , my sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell , and so obsequious will thy father be , even for the loss of thee , having no more , as priam was for all his valiant sons .
i bear thee hence , and let them fight that will , for i have murdered where i should not kill .

o lancaster , i fear thy overthrow more than my body parting with my soul !
my love and fear glued many friends to thee , and , now i fall , thy tough commixture melts .
impairing henry , strengthening misproud york , the common people swarm like summer flies , and whither fly the gnats but to the sun ?
and who shines now but henry enemies ?
o phoebus , hadst thou never given consent that phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds , thy burning car never had scorch the earth !
and , henry , hadst thou sway as kings should do , or as thy father and his father did , giving no ground unto the house of york , they never then had sprung like summer flies , i and ten thousand in this luckless realm had left no mourning widows for our death , and thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace .
for what doth cherish weeds but gentle air ?
and what makes robbers bold but too much lenity ?
bootless are plaints , and cureless are my wounds , no way to fly , nor strength to hold out flight the foe is merciless , and will not pity , for at their hands i have deserved no pity .
the air hath got into my deadly wounds , and much effuse of blood doth make me faint .
come , york and richard , warwick and the rest , i stabb your fathers ' bosoms , split my breast .

enter edward , george , richard , montague , warwick , and soldiers now breathe we , lords good fortune bids us pause , and smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks .
some troops pursue the queen , that led calm henry , though he were a king , as doth a sail , fill with a fretting gust , command an argosy to stem the waves .
but think you , lords , that clifford fled with them ?
no , is impossible he should escape , for , though before his face i speak the words your brother richard mark him for the grave and he is , he surely dead .
clifford groans , and dies whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave ?
a deadly groan , like life and death departing .
see who it is and , now the battle ended , if friend or foe , let him be gently used .
revoke that doom of mercy , for is clifford , who not contented that he lopp the branch in hewing rutland when his leaves put forth , but set his murdering knife unto the root from whence that tender spray did sweetly spring , i mean our princely father , duke of york .
from off the gates of york fetch down the head , your father head , which clifford placed there , instead whereof let this supply the room measure for measure must be answered .
bring forth that fatal to our house , that nothing sung but death to us and ours now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound , and his tongue no more shall speak .
i think his understanding is bereft .
speak , clifford , dost thou know who speaks to thee ?
dark cloudy death his beams of life , and he nor sees nor hears us what we say .
o , would he did !
and so perhaps he doth is but his policy to counterfeit , because he would avoid such bitter taunts which in the time of death he gave our father .
if so thou , vex him with eager words .
clifford , ask mercy and obtain no grace .
clifford , repent in bootless penitence .
clifford , devise excuses for thy faults .
while we devise fell tortures for thy faults .
thou didst love york , and i am son to york .
thou rutland , i will pity thee .
where captain margaret , to fence you now ?
they mock thee , clifford swear as thou wast wont .
what , not an oath ?
nay , then the world goes hard when clifford can not spare his friends an oath .
i know by that he dead , and , by my soul , if this right hand would buy two hour life , that i in all despite might rail at him , this hand should chop it off , and with the issuing blood stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst york and young rutland could not satisfy .
ay , but he dead off with the traitor head , and rear it in the place your father stands .
and now to london with triumphant march , there to be crowned england royal king from whence shall warwick cut the sea to france , and ask the lady bona for thy queen so shalt thou sinew both these lands together , and , having france thy friend , thou shalt not dread the scatter foe that hopes to rise again , for though they can not greatly sting to hurt , yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears .
first will i see the coronation , and then to brittany i cross the sea , to effect this marriage , so it please my lord .
even as thou wilt , sweet warwick , let it be , for in thy shoulder do i build my seat , and never will i undertake the thing wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting .
richard , i will create thee duke of gloucester , and george , of clarence warwick , as ourself , shall do and undo as him pleaseth best .
let me be duke of clarence , george of gloucester , for gloucester dukedom is too ominous .

that can not be , the noise of thy will scare the herd , and so my shoot is lost .
here stand we both , and aim we at the best and , for the time shall not seem tedious , i tell thee what befell me on a day in this where now we mean to stand .
here comes a man , let stay till he be past .
enter king henry vi , disguised , with a prayerbook from scotland am i , even of pure love , to greet mine own land with my wishful sight .
no , harry , harry , is no land of thine , thy place is fill , thy sceptre wrung from thee , thy balm wash off wherewith thou wast anointed no bending knee will call thee caesar now , no humble suitors press to speak for right , no , not a man comes for redress of thee , for how can i help them , and not myself ?
ay , here a deer whose skin a keeper fee this is the quondam king , let seize upon him .
let me embrace thee , sour adversity , for wise men say it is the wisest course .
why linger we ?
let us lay hands upon him .
forbear awhile , we hear a little more .
my queen and son are gone to france for aid , and , as i hear , the great commanding warwick is thither gone , to crave the french king sister to wife for edward if this news be true , poor queen and son , your labour is but lost , for warwick is a subtle orator , and lewis a prince soon won with moving words .
by this account then margaret may win him , for she a woman to be pitied much her sighs will make a battery in his breast , her tears will pierce into a marble heart , the tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn , and nero will be tainted with remorse , to hear and see her plaints , her brinish tears .
ay , but she come to beg , warwick to give , she , on his left side , craving aid for henry , he , on his right , asking a wife for edward .
she weeps , and says her henry is deposed , he smiles , and says his edward is install , that she , poor wretch , for grief can speak no more , whiles warwick tells his title , smooths the wrong , inferreth arguments of mighty strength , and in conclusion wins the king from her , with promise of his sister , and what else , to strengthen and support king edward place .
o margaret , thus be , and thou , poor soul , art then forsaken , as thou forlorn !
say , what art thou that of kings and queens ?
more than i seem , and less than i was born to a man at least , for less i should not be , and men may talk of kings , and why not i ?
ay , but thou as if thou wert a king .
why , so i am , in mind , and that enough .
but , if thou be a king , where is thy crown ?
my crown is in my heart , not on my head , not decked with diamonds and indian stones , nor to be seen my crown is called content a crown it is that seldom kings enjoy .
well , if you be a king crown with content , your crown content and you must be contented to go along with us , for as we think , you are the king king edward hath deposed , and we his subjects sworn in all allegiance will apprehend you as his enemy .
but did you never swear , and break an oath ?
no , never such an oath , nor will not now .
where did you dwell when i was king of england ?
here in this country , where we now remain .
i was anointed king at nine months old , my father and my grandfather were kings , and you were sworn true subjects unto me and tell me , then , have you not broke your oaths ?
no , for we were subjects but while you were king .
why , am i dead ?
do i not breathe a man ?
ah , simple men , you know not what you swear !
look , as i blow this feather from my face , and as the air blows it to me again , obeying with my wind when i do blow , and yielding to another when it blows , commanded always by the greater gust , such is the lightness of you common men .
but do not break your oaths , for of that sin my mild entreaty shall not make you guilty .
go where you will , the king shall be commanded , and be you kings , command , and i obey .
we are true subjects to the king , king edward .
so would you be again to henry , if he were seated as king edward is .
we charge you , in god name , and the king , to go with us unto the officers .
in god name , lead , your king name be obey and what god will , that let your king perform , and what he will , i humbly yield unto .
exeunt scene ii .
london .
the palace .
enter king edward iv , gloucester , clarence , and lady grey brother of gloucester , at saint alban field this lady husband , sir richard grey , was slain , his lands then seized on by the conqueror her suit is now to repossess those lands , which we in justice can not well deny , because in quarrel of the house of york the worthy gentleman did lose his life .
your highness shall do well to grant her suit , it were dishonour to deny it her .
it were no less , but yet i make a pause .
aside to clarence yea , is it so ?
i see the lady hath a thing to grant , before the king will grant her humble suit .
aside to gloucester he knows the game how true he keeps the wind !
aside to clarence silence !
widow , we will consider of your suit , and come some other time to know our mind .
right gracious lord , i can not brook delay may it please your highness to resolve me now , and what your pleasure is , shall satisfy me .
aside to clarence ay , widow ?
then i warrant you all your lands , an if what pleases him shall pleasure you .
fight closer , or , good faith , you catch a blow .
aside to gloucester i fear her not , unless she chance to fall .
aside to clarence god forbid that !
for he take vantages .
how many children hast thou , widow ?
tell me .
aside to gloucester i think he means to beg a child of her .
aside to clarence nay , whip me then he rather give her two .
three , my most gracious lord .
aside to clarence you shall have four , if you be ruled by him .
pity they should lose their father lands .
be pitiful , dread lord , and grant it then .
lords , give us leave i try this widow wit .
aside to clarence ay , good leave have you , for you will have leave , till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch .
gloucester and clarence retire now tell me , madam , do you love your children ?
ay , full as dearly as i love myself .
and would you not do much to do them good ?
to do them good , i would sustain some harm .
then get your husband lands , to do them good .
therefore i came unto your majesty .
i tell you how these lands are to be got .
so shall you bind me to your highness ' service .
what service wilt thou do me , if i give them ?
what you command , that rests in me to do .
but you will take exceptions to my boon .
no , gracious lord , except i can not do it .
ay , but thou canst do what i mean to ask .
why , then i will do what your grace commands .
aside to clarence he plies her hard , and much rain wears the marble .
aside to gloucester as red as fire !
nay , then her wax must melt .
why stops my lord , shall i not hear my task ?
an easy task , is but to love a king .
that soon perform , because i am a subject .
why , then , thy husband lands i freely give thee .
i take my leave with many thousand thanks .
aside to clarence the match is made , she seals it with a curtsy .
but stay thee , is the fruits of love i mean .
the fruits of love i mean , my loving liege .
ay , but , i fear me , in another sense .
what love , thou , i sue so much to get ?
my love till death , my humble thanks , my prayers , that love which virtue begs and virtue grants .
no , by my troth , i did not mean such love .
why , then you mean not as i thought you did .
but now you partly may perceive my mind .
my mind will never grant what i perceive your highness aims at , if i aim aright .
to tell thee plain , i aim to lie with thee .
to tell you plain , i had rather lie in prison .
why , then thou shalt not have thy husband lands .
why , then mine honesty shall be my dower , for by that loss i will not purchase them .
therein thou thy children mightily .
herein your highness wrongs both them and me .
but , mighty lord , this merry inclination accords not with the sadness of my suit please you dismiss me either with ' or . '
ay , if thou wilt say ' to my request , no if thou dost say ' to my demand .
then , no , my lord .
my suit is at an end .
aside to clarence the widow likes him not , she knits her brows .
aside to gloucester he is the bluntest wooer in christendom .
aside her looks do argue her replete with modesty , her words do show her wit incomparable , all her perfections challenge sovereignty one way or other , she is for a king , and she shall be my love , or else my say that king edward take thee for his queen ?
is better said than done , my gracious lord i am a subject fit to jest withal , but far unfit to be a sovereign .
sweet widow , by my state i swear to thee i speak no more than what my soul intends , and that is , to enjoy thee for my love .
and that is more than i will yield unto i know i am too mean to be your queen , and yet too good to be your concubine .
you cavil , widow i did mean , my queen .
grieve your grace my sons should call you father .
no more than when my daughters call thee mother .
thou art a widow , and thou hast some children , and , by god mother , i , being but a bachelor , have other some why , is a happy thing to be the father unto many sons .
answer no more , for thou shalt be my queen .
aside to clarence the ghostly father now hath done his shrift .
aside to gloucester when he was made a shriver , was for shift .
brothers , you muse what chat we two have had .
the widow likes it not , for she looks very sad .
you think it strange if i should marry her .
to whom , my lord ?
why , clarence , to myself .
that would be ten days ' wonder at the least .
that a day longer than a wonder lasts .
by so much is the wonder in extremes .
well , jest on , brothers i can tell you both her suit is granted for her husband lands .
enter a nobleman my gracious lord , henry your foe is taken , and brought your prisoner to your palace gate .
see that he be convey unto the tower and go we , brothers , to the man that took him , to question of his apprehension .
widow , go you along .
lords , use her honourably .
exeunt all but gloucester ay , edward will use women honourably .
would he were wasted , marrow , bones and all , that from his loins no hopeful branch may spring , to cross me from the golden time i look for !
and yet , between my soul desire and me the lustful edward title buried is clarence , henry , and his son young edward , and all the unlook for issue of their bodies , to take their rooms , ere i can place myself a cold premeditation for my purpose !
why , then , i do but dream on sovereignty , like one that stands upon a promontory , and spies a shore where he would tread , wishing his foot were equal with his eye , and chides the sea that sunders him from thence , saying , he lade it dry to have his way so do i wish the crown , being so far off , and so i chide the means that keeps me from it , and so i say , i cut the causes off , flattering me with impossibilities .
my eye too quick , my heart too much , unless my hand and strength could equal them .
well , say there is no kingdom then for richard , what other pleasure can the world afford ?
i make my heaven in a lady lap , and deck my body in gay ornaments , and witch sweet ladies with my words and looks .
o miserable thought !
and more unlikely than to accomplish twenty golden crowns !
why , love forswore me in my mother womb and , for i should not deal in her soft laws , she did corrupt frail nature with some bribe , to shrink mine arm up like a wither shrub , to make an envious mountain on my back , where sits deformity to mock my body , to shape my legs of an unequal size , to disproportion me in every part , like to a chaos , or an unlick that carries no impression like the dam .
and am i then a man to be beloved ?
o monstrous fault , to harbour such a thought !
then , since this earth affords no joy to me , but to command , to cheque , to such as are of better person than myself , i make my heaven to dream upon the crown , and , whiles i live , to account this world but hell , until my trunk that bears this head be round impaled with a glorious crown .
and yet i know not how to get the crown , for many lives stand between me and home and i , like one lost in a thorny wood , that rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns , seeking a way and straying from the way , not knowing how to find the open air , but toiling desperately to find it out , torment myself to catch the english crown and from that torment i will free myself , or hew my way out with a bloody axe .
why , i can smile , and murder whiles i smile , and cry ' to that which grieves my heart , and wet my cheeks with artificial tears , and frame my face to all occasions .
i drown more sailors than the mermaid shall , i slay more gazers than the basilisk , i play the orator as well as nestor , deceive more slily than ulysses could , and , like a sinon , take another troy .
i can add colours to the chameleon , change shapes with proteus for advantages , and set the murderous machiavel to school .
can i do this , and can not get a crown ?
tut , were it farther off , i pluck it down .
exit scene iii .
france .
king lewis xi palace .
flourish .
enter king lewis xi , his sister bona , his admiral , called bourbon , prince edward , queen margaret , and oxford .
king lewis xi sits , and riseth up again fair queen of england , worthy margaret , sit down with us it ill befits thy state and birth , that thou shouldst stand while lewis doth sit .
no , mighty king of france now margaret must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve where kings command .
i was , i must confess , great albion queen in former golden days but now mischance hath trod my title down , and with dishonour laid me on the ground , where i must take like seat unto my fortune , and to my humble seat conform myself .
why , say , fair queen , whence springs this deep despair ?
from such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears and stops my tongue , while heart is drown in cares .
it be , be thou still like thyself , and sit thee by our side seats her by him yield not thy neck to fortune yoke , but let thy dauntless mind still ride in triumph over all mischance .
be plain , queen margaret , and tell thy grief , it shall be eased , if france can yield relief .
those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts and give my sorrows leave to speak .
now , therefore , be it known to noble lewis , that henry , sole possessor of my love , is of a king become a banish man , and forced to live in scotland a forlorn , while proud ambitious edward duke of york usurps the regal title and the seat of england lawful king .
this is the cause that i , poor margaret , with this my son , prince edward , henry heir , am come to crave thy just and lawful aid , and if thou fail us , all our hope is done scotland hath will to help , but can not help , our people and our peers are both misled , our treasures seized , our soldiers put to flight , and , as thou seest , ourselves in heavy plight .
renowned queen , with patience calm the storm , while we bethink a means to break it off .
the more we stay , the stronger grows our foe .
the more i stay , the more i succor thee .
o , but impatience waiteth on true sorrow .
and see where comes the breeder of my sorrow !
enter warwick what he approacheth boldly to our presence ?
our earl of warwick , edward greatest friend .
welcome , brave warwick !
what brings thee to france ?
he descends .
she ariseth ay , now begins a second storm to rise , for this is he that moves both wind and tide .
from worthy edward , king of albion , my lord and sovereign , and thy vowed friend , i come , in kindness and unfeigned love , first , to do greetings to thy royal person , and then to crave a league of amity , and lastly , to confirm that amity with a nuptial knot , if thou vouchsafe to grant that virtuous lady bona , thy fair sister , to england king in lawful marriage .
aside if that go forward , henry hope is done .
to bona and , gracious madam , in our king behalf , i am commanded , with your leave and favour , humbly to kiss your hand , and with my tongue to tell the passion of my sovereign heart , where fame , late entering at his heedful ears , hath placed thy beauty image and thy virtue .
king lewis and lady bona , hear me speak , before you answer warwick .
his demand springs not from edward honest love , but from deceit bred by necessity , for how can tyrants safely govern home , unless abroad they purchase great alliance ?
to prove him tyrant this reason may suffice , that henry liveth still but were he dead , yet here prince edward stands , king henry son .
look , therefore , lewis , that by this league and marriage thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour , for though usurpers sway the rule awhile , yet heavens are just , and time suppresseth wrongs .
injurious margaret !
and why not queen ?
because thy father henry did usurp , and thou no more are prince than she is queen .
then warwick disannuls great john of gaunt , which did subdue the greatest part of spain , and , after john of gaunt , henry the fourth , whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest , and , after that wise prince , henry the fifth , who by his prowess conquered all france from these our henry lineally descends .
oxford , how haps it , in this smooth discourse , you told not how henry the sixth hath lost all that which henry fifth had gotten ?
methinks these peers of france should smile at that .
but for the rest , you tell a pedigree of threescore and two years , a silly time to make prescription for a kingdom worth .
why , warwick , canst thou speak against thy liege , whom thou thirty and six years , and not bewray thy treason with a blush ?
can oxford , that did ever fence the right , now buckler falsehood with a pedigree ?
for shame !
leave henry , and call edward king .
call him my king by whose injurious doom my elder brother , the lord aubrey vere , was done to death ?
and more than so , my father , even in the downfall of his mellow years , when nature brought him to the door of death ?
no , warwick , no , while life upholds this arm , this arm upholds the house of lancaster .
and i the house of york .
queen margaret , prince edward , and oxford , vouchsafe , at our request , to stand aside , while i use further conference with warwick .
they stand aloof heavens grant that warwick words bewitch him not !
now warwick , tell me , even upon thy conscience , is edward your true king ?
for i were loath to link with him that were not lawful chosen .
thereon i pawn my credit and mine honour .
but is he gracious in the people eye ?
the more that henry was unfortunate .
then further , all dissembling set aside , tell me for truth the measure of his love unto our sister bona .
such it seems as may beseem a monarch like himself .
myself have often heard him say and swear that this his love was an eternal plant , whereof the root was fix in virtue ground , the leaves and fruit maintain with beauty sun , exempt from envy , but not from disdain , unless the lady bona quit his pain .
now , sister , let us hear your firm resolve .
your grant , or your denial , shall be mine to warwick yet i confess that often ere this day , when i have heard your king desert recounted , mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire .
then , warwick , thus our sister shall be edward , and now forthwith shall articles be drawn touching the jointure that your king must make , which with her dowry shall be counterpoised .
draw near , queen margaret , and be a witness that bona shall be wife to the english king .
to edward , but not to the english king .
deceitful warwick !
it was thy device by this alliance to make void my suit before thy coming lewis was henry friend .
and still is friend to him and margaret but if your title to the crown be weak , as may appear by edward good success , then is but reason that i be released from giving aid which late i promised .
yet shall you have all kindness at my hand that your estate requires and mine can yield .
henry now lives in scotland at his ease , where having nothing , nothing can he lose .
and as for you yourself , our quondam queen , you have a father able to maintain you , and better you troubled him than france .
peace , impudent and shameless warwick , peace , proud setter up and puller down of kings !
i will not hence , till , with my talk and tears , both full of truth , i make king lewis behold thy sly conveyance and thy lord false love , for both of you are birds of selfsame feather .
post blows a horn within warwick , this is some post to us or thee .
enter a post to warwick my lord ambassador , these letters are for you , sent from your brother , marquess montague to king lewis xi these from our king unto your majesty to queen margaret and , madam , these for you , from whom i know not .
they all read their letters i like it well that our fair queen and mistress smiles at her news , while warwick frowns at his .
nay , mark how lewis stamps , as he were nettled i hope all for the best .
warwick , what are thy news ?
and yours , fair queen ?
mine , such as fill my heart with unhoped joys .
mine , full of sorrow and heart discontent .
what !
has your king married the lady grey !
and now , to soothe your forgery and his , sends me a paper to persuade me patience ?
is this the alliance that he seeks with france ?
dare he presume to scorn us in this manner ?
i told your majesty as much before this proveth edward love and warwick honesty .
king lewis , i here protest , in sight of heaven , and by the hope i have of heavenly bliss , that i am clear from this misdeed of edward , no more my king , for he dishonours me , but most himself , if he could see his shame .
did i forget that by the house of york my father came untimely to his death ?
did i let pass the abuse done to my niece ?
did i impale him with the regal crown ?
did i put henry from his native right ?
and am i guerdon at the last with shame ?
shame on himself !
for my desert is honour and to repair my honour lost for him , i here renounce him and return to henry .
my noble queen , let former grudges pass , and henceforth i am thy true servitor i will revenge his wrong to lady bona , and replant henry in his former state .
warwick , these words have turn my hate to love , and i forgive and quite forget old faults , and joy that thou becomest king henry friend .
so much his friend , ay , his unfeigned friend , that , if king lewis vouchsafe to furnish us with some few bands of chosen soldiers , i undertake to land them on our coast and force the tyrant from his seat by war .
is not his bride shall succor him and as for clarence , as my letters tell me , he very likely now to fall from him , for matching more for wanton lust than honour , or than for strength and safety of our country .
dear brother , how shall bona be revenged but by thy help to this distressed queen ?
renowned prince , how shall poor henry live , unless thou rescue him from foul despair ?
my quarrel and this english queen are one .
and mine , fair lady bona , joins with yours .
and mine with hers , and thine , and margaret .
therefore at last i firmly am resolved you shall have aid .
let me give humble thanks for all at once .
then , england messenger , return in post , and tell false edward , thy supposed king , that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride thou seest what past , go fear thy king withal .
tell him , in hope he prove a widower shortly , i wear the willow garland for his sake .
tell him , my mourning weeds are laid aside , and i am ready to put armour on .
tell him from me that he hath done me wrong , and therefore i uncrown him be long .
there thy reward be gone .
exit post but , warwick , thou and oxford , with five thousand men , shall cross the seas , and bid false edward battle , and , as occasion serves , this noble queen and prince shall follow with a fresh supply .
yet , ere thou go , but answer me one doubt , what pledge have we of thy firm loyalty ?
this shall assure my constant loyalty , that if our queen and this young prince agree , i join mine eldest daughter and my joy to him forthwith in holy wedlock bands .
yes , i agree , and thank you for your motion .
son edward , she is fair and virtuous , therefore delay not , give thy hand to warwick , and , with thy hand , thy faith irrevocable , that only warwick daughter shall be thine .
yes , i accept her , for she well deserves it , and here , to pledge my vow , i give my hand .
he gives his hand to warwick why stay we now ?
these soldiers shall be levied , and thou , lord bourbon , our high admiral , shalt waft them over with our royal fleet .
i long till edward fall by war mischance , for mocking marriage with a dame of france .
exeunt all but warwick i came from edward as ambassador , but i return his sworn and mortal foe matter of marriage was the charge he gave me , but dreadful war shall answer his demand .
had he none else to make a stale but me ?
then none but i shall turn his jest to sorrow .
i was the chief that raised him to the crown , and i be chief to bring him down again not that i pity henry misery , but seek revenge on edward mockery .
exit act iv scene london .
the palace .
enter gloucester , clarence , somerset , and montague now tell me , brother clarence , what think you of this new marriage with the lady grey ?
hath not our brother made a worthy choice ?
alas , you know , is far from hence to france , how could he stay till warwick made return ?
my lords , forbear this talk , here comes the king .
and his bride .
i mind to tell him plainly what i think .
flourish .
enter king edward iv , attended , queen elizabeth , pembroke , stafford , hastings , and others now , brother of clarence , how like you our choice , that you stand pensive , as half malcontent ?
as well as lewis of france , or the earl of warwick , which are so weak of courage and in judgment that they take no offence at our abuse .
suppose they take offence without a cause , they are but lewis and warwick i am edward , your king and warwick , and must have my will .
and shall have your will , because our king yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well .
yea , brother richard , are you offended too ?
not i no , god forbid that i should wish them sever whom god hath join together , ay , and pity to sunder them that yoke so well together .
setting your scorns and your mislike aside , tell me some reason why the lady grey should not become my wife and england queen .
and you too , somerset and montague , speak freely what you think .
then this is mine opinion that king lewis becomes your enemy , for mocking him about the marriage of the lady bona .
and warwick , doing what you gave in charge , is now dishonoured by this new marriage .
what if both lewis and warwick be appeased by such invention as i can devise ?
yet , to have join with france in such alliance would more have strengthen this our commonwealth foreign storms than any marriage .
why , knows not montague that of itself england is safe , if true within itself ?
but the safer when is back with france .
is better using france than trusting france let us be back with god and with the seas which he hath given for fence impregnable , and with their helps only defend ourselves , in them and in ourselves our safety lies .
for this one speech lord hastings well deserves to have the heir of the lord hungerford .
ay , what of that ?
it was my will and grant , and for this once my will shall stand for law .
and yet methinks your grace hath not done well , to give the heir and daughter of lord scales unto the brother of your loving bride , she better would have fitted me or clarence but in your bride you bury brotherhood .
or else you would not have bestow the heir of the lord bonville on your new wife son , and leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere .
alas , poor clarence !
is it for a wife that thou art malcontent ?
i will provide thee .
in choosing for yourself , you show your judgment , which being shallow , you give me leave to play the broker in mine own behalf , and to that end i shortly mind to leave you .
leave me , or tarry , edward will be king , and not be tied unto his brother will .
my lords , before it pleased his majesty to raise my state to title of a queen , do me but right , and you must all confess that i was not ignoble of descent , and meaner than myself have had like fortune .
but as this title honours me and mine , so your dislike , to whom i would be pleasing , doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow .
my love , forbear to fawn upon their frowns what danger or what sorrow can befall thee , so long as edward is thy constant friend , and their true sovereign , whom they must obey ?
nay , whom they shall obey , and love thee too , unless they seek for hatred at my hands , which if they do , yet will i keep thee safe , and they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath .
aside i hear , yet say not much , but think the more .
enter a post now , messenger , what letters or what news from france ?
my sovereign liege , no letters , and few words , but such as i , without your special pardon , dare not relate .
go to , we pardon thee therefore , in brief , tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them .
what answer makes king lewis unto our letters ?
at my depart , these were his very words tell false edward , thy supposed king , that lewis of france is sending over masquers to revel it with him and his new bride . '
is lewis so brave ?
belike he thinks me henry .
but what said lady bona to my marriage ?
these were her words , utter with mad disdain him , in hope he prove a widower shortly , i wear the willow garland for his sake . '
i blame not her , she could say little less , she had the wrong .
but what said henry queen ?
for i have heard that she was there in place .
him , ' quoth she , mourning weeds are done , and i am ready to put armour on . '
belike she minds to play the amazon .
but what said warwick to these injuries ?
he , more incensed against your majesty than all the rest , discharged me with these words him from me that he hath done me wrong , and therefore i uncrown him be long . '
ha !
durst the traitor breathe out so proud words ?
well i will arm me , being thus forewarn they shall have wars and pay for their presumption .
but say , is warwick friends with margaret ?
ay , gracious sovereign , they are so link in friendship that young prince edward marries warwick daughter .
belike the elder , clarence will have the younger .
now , brother king , farewell , and sit you fast , for i will hence to warwick other daughter , that , though i want a kingdom , yet in marriage i may not prove inferior to yourself .
you that love me and warwick , follow me .
exit clarence , and somerset follows aside not i my thoughts aim at a further matter , i stay not for the love of edward , but the crown .
clarence and somerset both gone to warwick !
yet am i arm against the worst can happen , and haste is needful in this desperate case .
pembroke and stafford , you in our behalf go levy men , and make prepare for war , they are already , or quickly will be landed myself in person will straight follow you .
exeunt pembroke and stafford but , ere i go , hastings and montague , resolve my doubt .
you twain , of all the rest , are near to warwick by blood and by alliance tell me if you love warwick more than me ?
if it be so , then both depart to him , i rather wish you foes than hollow friends but if you mind to hold your true obedience , give me assurance with some friendly vow , that i may never have you in suspect .
so god help montague as he proves true !
and hastings as he favours edward cause !
now , brother richard , will you stand by us ?
ay , in despite of all that shall withstand you .
why , so !
then am i sure of victory .
now therefore let us hence , and lose no hour , till we meet warwick with his foreign power .
exeunt scene ii .
a plain in warwickshire .
enter warwick and oxford , with french soldiers trust me , my lord , all hitherto goes well , the common people by numbers swarm to us .
enter clarence and somerset but see where somerset and clarence come !
speak suddenly , my lords , are we all friends ?
fear not that , my lord .
then , gentle clarence , welcome unto warwick , and welcome , somerset i hold it cowardice to rest mistrustful where a noble heart hath pawn an open hand in sign of love , else might i think that clarence , edward brother , were but a feigned friend to our proceedings but welcome , sweet clarence , my daughter shall be thine .
and now what rests but , in night coverture , thy brother being carelessly encamp , his soldiers lurking in the towns about , and but attended by a simple guard , we may surprise and take him at our pleasure ?
our scouts have found the adventure very easy that as ulysses and stout diomede with sleight and manhood stole to rhesus ' tents , and brought from thence the thracian fatal steeds , so we , well cover with the night black mantle , at unawares may beat down edward guard and seize himself , i say not , slaughter him , for i intend but only to surprise him .
you that will follow me to this attempt , applaud the name of henry with your leader .
they all cry , ! '
why , then , let on our way in silent sort for warwick and his friends , god and saint george !
exeunt scene iii .
edward camp , near warwick .
enter three watchmen , to guard king edward iv tent come on , my masters , each man take his stand the king by this is set him down to sleep .
what , will he not to bed ?
why , no , for he hath made a solemn vow never to lie and take his natural rest till warwick or himself be quite suppress .
then belike shall be the day , if warwick be so near as men report .
but say , i pray , what nobleman is that that with the king here resteth in his tent ?
is the lord hastings , the king chiefest friend .
o , is it so ?
but why commands the king that his chief followers lodge in towns about him , while he himself keeps in the cold field ?
is the more honour , because more dangerous .
ay , but give me worship and quietness , i like it better than a dangerous honour .
if warwick knew in what estate he stands , is to be doubted he would waken him .
unless our halberds did shut up his passage .
ay , wherefore else guard we his royal tent , but to defend his person from ?
enter warwick , clarence , oxford , somerset , and french soldiers , silent all this is his tent , and see where stand his guard .
courage , my masters !
honour now or never !
but follow me , and edward shall be ours .
who goes there ?
stay , or thou diest !
warwick and the rest cry all , !
warwick ! '
and set upon the guard , who fly , crying , !
arm ! '
warwick and the rest following them the drum playing and trumpet sounding , reenter warwick , somerset , and the rest , bringing king edward iv out in his gown , sitting in a chair .
richard and hastings fly over the stage what are they that fly there ?
richard and hastings let them go , here is the duke .
the duke !
why , warwick , when we parted , thou me king .
ay , but the case is alter when you disgraced me in my embassade , then i degraded you from being king , and come now to create you duke of york .
alas !
how should you govern any kingdom , that know not how to use ambassadors , nor how to be contented with one wife , nor how to use your brothers brotherly , nor how to study for the people welfare , nor how to shroud yourself from enemies ?
yea , brother of clarence , are thou here too ?
nay , then i see that edward needs must down .
yet , warwick , in despite of all mischance , of thee thyself and all thy complices , edward will always bear himself as king though fortune malice overthrow my state , my mind exceeds the compass of her wheel .
then , for his mind , be edward england king takes off his crown but henry now shall wear the english crown , and be true king indeed , thou but the shadow .
my lord of somerset , at my request , see that forthwith duke edward be convey unto my brother , archbishop of york .
when i have fought with pembroke and his fellows , i follow you , and tell what answer lewis and the lady bona send to him .

enter queen elizabeth and rivers madam , what makes you in this sudden change ?
why brother rivers , are you yet to learn what late misfortune is king edward ?
what !
loss of some pitch battle against warwick ?
no , but the loss of his own royal person .
then is my sovereign slain ?
ay , almost slain , for he is taken prisoner , either betray by falsehood of his guard or by his foe surprised at unawares and , as i further have to understand , is new committed to the bishop of york , fell warwick brother and by that our foe .
these news i must confess are full of grief , yet , gracious madam , bear it as you may warwick may lose , that now hath won the day .
till then fair hope must hinder life decay .
and i the rather wean me from despair for love of edward offspring in my womb this is it that makes me bridle passion and bear with mildness my misfortune cross , ay , ay , for this i draw in many a tear and stop the rising of sighs , lest with my sighs or tears i blast or drown king edward fruit , true heir to the english crown .
but , madam , where is warwick then become ?
i am inform that he comes towards london , to set the crown once more on henry head guess thou the rest , king edward friends must down , but , to prevent the tyrant violence , for trust not him that hath once broken faith , i hence forthwith unto the sanctuary , to save at least the heir of edward right there shall i rest secure from force and fraud .
come , therefore , let us fly while we may fly if warwick take us we are sure to die .
exeunt scene a park near middleham castle in yorkshire .
enter gloucester , hastings , and stanley now , my lord hastings and sir william stanley , leave off to wonder why i drew you hither , into this chiefest thicket of the park .
thus stands the case you know our king , my brother , is prisoner to the bishop here , at whose hands he hath good usage and great liberty , and , often but attended with weak guard , comes hunting this way to disport himself .
i have advertised him by secret means that if about this hour he make his way under the colour of his usual game , he shall here find his friends with horse and men to set him free from his captivity .
enter king edward iv and a huntsman with him this way , my lord , for this way lies the game .
nay , this way , man see where the huntsmen stand .
now , brother of gloucester , lord hastings , and the rest , stand you thus close , to steal the bishop deer ?
brother , the time and case requireth haste your horse stands ready at the .
but whither shall we then ?
to lynn , my lord , and ship from thence to flanders .
well guess , believe me , for that was my meaning .
stanley , i will requite thy forwardness .
but wherefore stay we ?
is no time to talk .
huntsman , what thou ?
wilt thou go along ?
better do so than tarry and be hang .

subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns , but if an humble prayer may prevail , i then crave pardon of your majesty .
for what , lieutenant ?
for well using me ?
nay , be thou sure i well requite thy kindness , for that it made my imprisonment a pleasure , ay , such a pleasure as incaged birds conceive when after many moody thoughts at last by notes of household harmony they quite forget their loss of liberty .
but , warwick , after god , thou me free , and chiefly therefore i thank god and thee , he was the author , thou the instrument .
therefore , that i may conquer fortune spite by living low , where fortune can not hurt me , and that the people of this blessed land may not be punish with my thwarting stars , warwick , although my head still wear the crown , i here resign my government to thee , for thou art fortunate in all thy deeds .
your grace hath still been famed for virtuous , and now may seem as wise as virtuous , by spying and avoiding fortune malice , for few men rightly temper with the stars yet in this one thing let me blame your grace , for choosing me when clarence is in place .
no , warwick , thou art worthy of the sway , to whom the heavens in thy nativity adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown , as likely to be blest in peace and war , and therefore i yield thee my free consent .
and i choose clarence only for protector .
warwick and clarence give me both your hands now join your hands , and with your hands your hearts , that no dissension hinder government i make you both protectors of this land , while i myself will lead a private life and in devotion spend my latter days , to sin rebuke and my creator praise .
what answers clarence to his sovereign will ?
that he consents , if warwick yield consent , for on thy fortune i repose myself .
why , then , though loath , yet must i be content we yoke together , like a double shadow to henry body , and supply his place , i mean , in bearing weight of government , while he enjoys the honour and his ease .
and , clarence , now then it is more than needful forthwith that edward be pronounced a traitor , and all his lands and goods be confiscate .
what else ?
and that succession be determined .
ay , therein clarence shall not want his part .
but , with the first of all your chief affairs , let me entreat , for i command no more , that margaret your queen and my son edward be sent for , to return from france with speed , for , till i see them here , by doubtful fear my joy of liberty is half eclipsed .
it shall be done , my sovereign , with all speed .
my lord of somerset , what youth is that , of whom you seem to have so tender care ?
my liege , it is young henry , earl of richmond .
come hither , england hope .
lays his hand on his head if secret powers suggest but truth to my divining thoughts , this pretty lad will prove our country bliss .
his looks are full of peaceful majesty , his head by nature framed to wear a crown , his hand to wield a sceptre , and himself likely in time to bless a regal throne .
make much of him , my lords , for this is he must help you more than you are hurt by me .
enter a post what news , my friend ?
that edward is escaped from your brother , and fled , as he hears since , to burgundy .
unsavoury news !
but how made he escape ?
he was convey by richard duke of gloucester and the lord hastings , who attended him in secret ambush on the forest side and from the bishop huntsmen rescued him , for hunting was his daily exercise .
my brother was too careless of his charge .
but let us hence , my sovereign , to provide a salve for any sore that may betide .
exeunt all but somerset , henry of richmond , and oxford my lord , i like not of this flight of edward , for doubtless burgundy will yield him help , and we shall have more wars before be long .
as henry late presaging prophecy did glad my heart with hope of this young richmond , so doth my heart misgive me , in these conflicts what may befall him , to his harm and ours therefore , lord oxford , to prevent the worst , forthwith we send him hence to brittany , till storms be past of civil enmity .
ay , for if edward repossess the crown , is like that richmond with the rest shall down .
it shall be so , he shall to brittany .
come , therefore , let about it speedily .

well have we pass and now repass the seas and brought desired help from burgundy what then remains , we being thus arrived from ravenspurgh haven before the gates of york , but that we enter , as into our dukedom ?
the gates made fast !
brother , i like not this , for many men that stumble at the threshold are well foretold that danger lurks within .
tush , man , abodements must not now affright us by fair or foul means we must enter in , for hither will our friends repair to us .
my liege , i knock once more to summon them .
enter , on the walls , the mayor of york , and his brethren my lords , we were forewarned of your coming , and shut the gates for safety of ourselves , for now we owe allegiance unto henry .
but , master mayor , if henry be your king , yet edward at the least is duke of york .
true , my good lord , i know you for no less .
why , and i challenge nothing but my dukedom , as being well content with that alone .
aside but when the fox hath once got in his nose , he soon find means to make the body follow .
why , master mayor , why stand you in a doubt ?
open the gates , we are king henry friends .
ay , say you so ?
the gates shall then be open .
they descend a wise stout captain , and soon persuaded !
the good old man would fain that all were well , so not of him , but being enter , i doubt not , i , but we shall soon persuade both him and all his brothers unto reason .

welcome , sir john !
but why come you in arms ?
to help king edward in his time of storm , as every loyal subject ought to do .
thanks , good montgomery , but we now forget our title to the crown and only claim our dukedom till god please to send the rest .
then fare you well , for i will hence again i came to serve a king and not a duke .
drummer , strike up , and let us march away .
the drum begins to march nay , stay , sir john , awhi le , and we debate by what safe means the crown may be recover .
what talk you of debating ?
in few words , if you not here proclaim yourself our king , i leave you to your fortune and be gone to keep them back that come to succor you why shall we fight , if you pretend no title ?
why , brother , wherefore stand you on nice points ?
when we grow stronger , then we make our claim till then , is wisdom to conceal our meaning .
away with scrupulous wit !
now arms must rule .
and fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns .
brother , we will proclaim you out of hand the bruit thereof will bring you many friends .
then be it as you will , for is my right , and henry but usurps the diadem .
ay , now my sovereign speaketh like himself , and now will i be edward champion .

now , for this night , let harbour here in york , and when the morning sun shall raise his car above the border of this horizon , we forward towards warwick and his mates , for well i wot that henry is no soldier .
ah , froward clarence !

let levy men , and beat him back again .
a little fire is quickly trodden out , which , being suffer , rivers can not quench .
in warwickshire i have friends , not mutinous in peace , yet bold in war , those will i muster up and thou , son clarence , shalt stir up in suffolk , norfolk , and in kent , the knights and gentlemen to come with thee thou , brother montague , in buckingham , northampton and in leicestershire , shalt find men well inclined to hear what thou and thou , brave oxford , wondrous well beloved , in oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends .
my sovereign , with the loving citizens , like to his island girt in with the ocean , or modest dian circled with her nymphs , shall rest in london till we come to him .
fair lords , take leave and stand not to reply .
farewell , my sovereign .
farewell , my hector , and my troy true hope .
in sign of truth , i kiss your highness ' hand .

farewell , sweet lords let meet at coventry .
exeunt all but king henry vi and exeter here at the palace i will rest awhile .
cousin of exeter , what thinks your lordship ?
methinks the power that edward hath in field should not be able to encounter mine .
the doubt is that he will seduce the rest .
that not my fear , my meed hath got me fame i have not stopp mine ears to their demands , nor posted off their suits with slow delays , my pity hath been balm to heal their wounds , my mildness hath allay their swelling griefs , my mercy dried their tears , i have not been desirous of their wealth , nor much oppress them with great subsidies .
nor forward of revenge , though they much err then why should they love edward more than me ?
no , exeter , these graces challenge grace and when the lion fawns upon the lamb , the lamb will never cease to follow him .

see how the surly warwick mans the wall !
o unbid spite !
is sportful edward come ?
where slept our scouts , or how are they seduced , that we could hear no news of his repair ?
now , warwick , wilt thou ope the city gates , speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee , call edward king and at his hands beg mercy ?
and he shall pardon thee these outrages .
nay , rather , wilt thou draw thy forces hence , confess who set thee up and pluck thee own , call warwick patron and be penitent ?
and thou shalt still remain the duke of york .
i thought , at least , he would have said the king , or did he make the jest against his will ?
is not a dukedom , sir , a goodly gift ?
ay , by my faith , for a poor earl to give i do thee service for so good a gift .
was i that gave the kingdom to thy brother .
why then is mine , if but by warwick gift .
thou art no atlas for so great a weight and weakling , warwick takes his gift again , and henry is my king , warwick his subject .
but warwick king is edward prisoner and , gallant warwick , do but answer this what is the body when the head is off ?
alas , that warwick had no more forecast , but , whiles he thought to steal the single ten , the king was slily finger from the deck !
you left poor henry at the bishop palace , and , ten to one , you meet him in the tower .
is even so , yet you are warwick still .
come , warwick , take the time , kneel down , kneel down nay , when ?
strike now , or else the iron cools .
i had rather chop this hand off at a blow , and with the other fling it at thy face , than bear so low a sail , to strike to thee .
sail how thou canst , have wind and tide thy friend , this hand , fast wound about thy hair shall , whiles thy head is warm and new cut off , write in the dust this sentence with thy blood , warwick now can change no more . '

come , clarence , come , thou wilt , if warwick call .
father of warwick , know you what this means ?
taking his red rose out of his hat look here , i throw my infamy at thee i will not ruinate my father house , who gave his blood to lime the stones together , and set up lancaster .
why , thou , warwick , that clarence is so harsh , so blunt , unnatural , to bend the fatal instruments of war against his brother and his lawful king ?
perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath to keep that oath were more impiety than jephthah , when he sacrificed his daughter .
i am so sorry for my trespass made that , to deserve well at my brother hands , i here proclaim myself thy mortal foe , with resolution , i meet thee as i will meet thee , if thou stir abroad to plague thee for thy foul misleading me .
and so , warwick , i defy thee , and to my brother turn my blushing cheeks .
pardon me , edward , i will make amends and , richard , do not frown upon my faults , for i will henceforth be no more unconstant .
now welcome more , and ten times more beloved , than if thou never hadst deserved our hate .
welcome , good clarence , this is brotherlike .
o passing traitor , perjured and unjust !
what , warwick , wilt thou leave the town and fight ?
or shall we beat the stones about thine ears ?
alas , i am not coop here for defence !

exit ah , who is nigh ?
come to me , friend or foe , and tell me who is victor , york or warwick ?
why ask i that ?
my mangled body shows , my blood , my want of strength , my sick heart shows .
that i must yield my body to the earth and , by my fall , the conquest to my foe .
thus yields the cedar to the axe edge , whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle , under whose shade the ramping lion slept , whose overpeer jove spreading tree and kept low shrubs from winter powerful wind .
these eyes , that now are dimm with death black veil , have been as piercing as the sun , to search the secret treasons of the world the wrinkles in my brows , now filled with blood , were liken oft to kingly sepulchres , for who lived king , but i could dig his grave ?
and who durst mine when warwick bent his brow ?
lo , now my glory smear in dust and blood !
my parks , my walks , my manors that i had .
even now forsake me , and of all my lands is nothing left me but my body length .
why , what is pomp , rule , reign , but earth and dust ?

why , then i would not fly .
ah , montague , if thou be there , sweet brother , take my hand .
and with thy lips keep in my soul awhile !
thou lovest me not , for , brother , if thou didst , thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood that glues my lips and will not let me speak .
come quickly , montague , or i am dead .
ah , warwick !
montague hath breathed his last , and to the latest gasp cried out for warwick , and said me to my valiant brother . '
and more he would have said , and more he spoke , which sounded like a clamour in a vault , that mought not be distinguished , but at last i well might hear , delivered with a groan , ' o , farewell , warwick ! '
sweet rest his soul !
fly , lords , and save yourselves , for warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven .

a little gale will soon disperse that cloud and blow it to the source from whence it came the very beams will dry those vapours up , for every cloud engenders not a storm .

tread on the sand , why , there you quickly sink bestride the rock , the tide will wash you off , or else you famish , that a threefold death .
this speak i , lords , to let you understand , if case some one of you would fly from us , that there no mercy with the brothers more than with ruthless waves , with sands and rocks .
why , courage then !
what can not be avoided childish weakness to lament or fear .
methinks a woman of this valiant spirit should , if a coward heard her speak these words , infuse his breast with magnanimity and make him , naked , foil a man at arms .
i speak not this as doubting any here for did i but suspect a fearful man he should have leave to go away betimes , lest in our need he might infect another and make him of like spirit to himself .
if any such be here as god forbid ! let him depart before we need his help .
women and children of so high a courage , and warriors faint !
why , perpetual shame .

thy famous grandfather doth live again in thee long mayst thou live to bear his image and renew his glories !

good clarence , do , sweet clarence , do thou do it .
didst thou not hear me swear i would not do it ?
ay , but thou usest to forswear thyself was sin before , but now is charity .

what scene of death hath roscius now to act ?
suspicion always haunts the guilty mind , the thief doth fear each bush an officer .
the bird that hath been limed in a bush , with trembling wings misdoubteth every bush , and i , the hapless male to one sweet bird , have now the fatal object in my eye where my poor young was limed , was caught and kill .
why , what a peevish fool was that of crete , that taught his son the office of a fowl !
an yet , for all his wings , the fool was drown .
i , daedalus , my poor boy , icarus , thy father , minos , that denied our course , the sun that sear the wings of my sweet boy thy brother edward , and thyself the sea whose envious gulf did swallow up his life .
ah , kill me with thy weapon , not with words !
my breast can better brook thy dagger point than can my ears that tragic history .
but wherefore dost thou come ?
for my life ?
thou i am an executioner ?
a persecutor , i am sure , thou art if murdering innocents be executing , why , then thou art an executioner .
thy son i kill for his presumption .
hadst thou been kill when first thou didst presume , thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine .
and thus i prophesy , that many a thousand , which now mistrust no parcel of my fear , and many an old man sigh and many a widow , and many an orphan eye men for their sons , wives for their husbands , and orphans for their parents timeless death shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born .
the owl shriek at thy birth , an evil sign , the cried , aboding luckless time , dogs howl , and hideous tempest shook down trees , the raven rook her on the chimney top , and chattering pies in dismal discords sung .
thy mother felt more than a mother pain , and , yet brought forth less than a mother hope , to wit , an indigested and deformed lump , not like the fruit of such a goodly tree .
teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born , to signify thou camest to bite the world and , if the rest be true which i have heard , thou camest i hear no more die , prophet in thy speech stabs him for this amongst the rest , was i ordain .
ay , and for much more slaughter after this .
god forgive my sins , and pardon thee !
dies what , will the aspiring blood of lancaster sink in the ground ?
i thought it would have mounted .
see how my sword weeps for the poor king death !
o , may such purple tears be alway shed from those that wish the downfall of our house !
if any spark of life be yet remaining , down , down to hell , and say i sent thee thither stabs him again i , that have neither pity , love , nor fear .
indeed , is true that henry told me of , for i have often heard my mother say i came into the world with my legs forward had i not reason , think ye , to make haste , and seek their ruin that usurp our right ?
the midwife wonder and the women cried ' o , jesus bless us , he is born with teeth ! '
and so i was , which plainly signified that i should snarl and bite and play the dog .
then , since the heavens have shaped my body so , let hell make crook my mind to answer it .
i have no brother , i am like no brother , and this word , ' which graybeards call divine , be resident in men like one another and not in me i am myself alone .
clarence , beware , thou me from the light but i will sort a pitchy day for thee , for i will buz abroad such prophecies that edward shall be fearful of his life , and then , to purge his fear , i be thy death .
king henry and the prince his son are gone clarence , thy turn is next , and then the rest , counting myself but bad till i be best .
i throw thy body in another room and triumph , henry , in thy day of doom .

exeunt act i scene rousillon .
the count palace .
enter bertram , the countess of rousillon , helena , and lafeu , all in black in delivering my son from me , i bury a second husband .
and i in going , madam , weep my father death anew but i must attend his majesty command , to whom i am now in ward , evermore in subjection .
you shall find of the king a husband , madam , you , sir , a father he that so generally is at all times good must of necessity hold his virtue to you , whose worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather than lack it where there is such abundance .
what hope is there of his majesty amendment ?
he hath abandoned his physicians , madam , under whose practises he hath persecuted time with hope , and finds no other advantage in the process but only the losing of hope by time .
this young gentlewoman had a father , o , that ' !
how sad a passage is ! whose skill was almost as great as his honesty , had it stretched so far , would have made nature immortal , and death should have play for lack of work .
would , for the king sake , he were living !
i think it would be the death of the king disease .
how called you the man you speak of , madam ?
he was famous , sir , in his profession , and it was his great right to be so gerard de narbon .
he was excellent indeed , madam the king very lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly he was skilful enough to have lived still , if knowledge could be set up against mortality .
what is it , my good lord , the king languishes of ?
a fistula , my lord .
i heard not of it before .
i would it were not notorious .
was this gentlewoman the daughter of gerard de narbon ?
his sole child , my lord , and bequeathed to my overlooking .
i have those hopes of her good that her education promises , her dispositions she inherits , which makes fair gifts fairer , for where an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities , there commendations go with pity , they are virtues and traitors too , in her they are the better for their simpleness , she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness .
your commendations , madam , get from her tears .
is the best brine a maiden can season her praise in .
the remembrance of her father never approaches her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all livelihood from her cheek .
no more of this , helena , go to , no more , lest it be rather thought you affect a sorrow than have it .
i do affect a sorrow indeed , but i have it too .
moderate lamentation is the right of the dead , excessive grief the enemy to the living .
if the living be enemy to the grief , the excess makes it soon mortal .
madam , i desire your holy wishes .
how understand we that ?
be thou blest , bertram , and succeed thy father in manners , as in shape !
thy blood and virtue contend for empire in thee , and thy goodness share with thy birthright !
love all , trust a few , do wrong to none be able for thine enemy rather in power than use , and keep thy friend under thy own life key be cheque for silence , but never tax for speech .
what heaven more will , that thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down , fall on thy head !
farewell , my lord , is an unseason courtier , good my lord , advise him .
he can not want the best that shall attend his love .
heaven bless him !
farewell , bertram .
exit to helena the best wishes that can be forged in your thoughts be servants to you !
be comfortable to my mother , your mistress , and make much of her .
farewell , pretty lady you must hold the credit of your father .
exeunt bertram and lafeu o , were that all !
i think not on my father , and these great tears grace his remembrance more than those i shed for him .
what was he like ?
i have forgot him my imagination carries no favour i but bertram .
i am undone there is no living , none , if bertram be away .
all one that i should love a bright particular star and think to wed it , he is so above me in his bright radiance and collateral light must i be comforted , not in his sphere .
the ambition in my love thus plagues itself the hind that would be mated by the lion must die for love .
was pretty , though plague , to see him every hour , to sit and draw his arched brows , his hawking eye , his curls , in our heart table , heart too capable of every line and trick of his sweet favour but now he gone , and my idolatrous fancy must sanctify his reliques .
who comes here ?
enter parolles aside one that goes with him i love him for his sake , and yet i know him a notorious liar , think him a great way fool , solely a coward , yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him , that they take place , when virtue steely bones look bleak i ' the cold wind withal , full oft we see cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly .
save you , fair queen !
and you , monarch !
no .
and no .
are you meditating on virginity ?
ay .
you have some stain of soldier in you let me ask you a question .
man is enemy to virginity , how may we barricado it against him ?
keep him out .
but he assails , and our virginity , though valiant , in the defence yet is weak unfold to us some warlike resistance .
there is none man , sitting down before you , will undermine you and blow you up .
bless our poor virginity from underminers and blowers up !
is there no military policy , how virgins might blow up men ?
virginity being blown down , man will quicklier be blown up marry , in blowing him down again , with the breach yourselves made , you lose your city .
it is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to preserve virginity .
loss of virginity is rational increase and there was never virgin got till virginity was first lost .
that you were made of is metal to make virgins .
virginity by being once lost may be ten times found , by being ever kept , it is ever lost is too cold a companion , away with !
i will stand for a little , though therefore i die a virgin .
there little can be said in , is against the rule of nature .
to speak on the part of virginity , is to accuse your mothers , which is most infallible disobedience .
he that hangs himself is a virgin virginity murders itself and should be buried in highways out of all sanctified limit , as a desperate offendress against nature .
virginity breeds mites , much like a cheese , consumes itself to the very paring , and so dies with feeding his own stomach .
besides , virginity is peevish , proud , idle , made of , which is the most inhibited sin in the canon .
keep it not , you can not choose but loose out with !
within ten year it will make itself ten , which is a goodly increase , and the principal itself not much the worse away with !
how might one do , sir , to lose it to her own liking ?
let me see marry , ill , to like him that it likes .
is a commodity will lose the gloss with lying , the longer kept , the less worth off with while is vendible , answer the time of request .
virginity , like an old courtier , wears her cap out of fashion richly suited , but unsuitable just like the brooch and the , which wear not now .
your date is better in your pie and your porridge than in your cheek , and your virginity , your old virginity , is like one of our french withered pears , it looks ill , it eats drily , marry , is a withered pear , it was formerly better , marry , yet is a withered pear will you anything with it ?
not my virginity yet there shall your master have a thousand loves , a mother and a mistress and a friend , a phoenix , captain and an enemy , a guide , a goddess , and a sovereign , a counsellor , a traitress , and a dear , his humble ambition , proud humility , his jarring concord , and his discord dulcet , his faith , his sweet disaster , with a world of pretty , fond , adoptious christendoms , that blinking cupid gossips .
now shall he i know not what he shall .
god send him well !
the court a learning place , and he is one what one , i ' faith ?
that i wish well .
is pity what pity ?
that wishing well had not a body i , which might be felt , that we , the poorer born , whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes , might with effects of them follow our friends , and show what we alone must think , which never return us thanks .
enter page monsieur parolles , my lord calls for you .
exit little helen , farewell , if i can remember thee , i will think of thee at court .
monsieur parolles , you were born under a charitable star .
under mars , i .
i especially think , under mars .
why under mars ?
the wars have so kept you under that you must needs be born under mars .
when he was predominant .
when he was retrograde , i think , rather .
why think you so ?
you go so much backward when you fight .
that for advantage .
so is running away , when fear proposes the safety , but the composition that your valour and fear makes in you is a virtue of a good wing , and i like the wear well .
i am so full of businesses , i can not answer thee acutely .
i will return perfect courtier , in the which , my instruction shall serve to naturalize thee , so thou wilt be capable of a courtier counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon thee , else thou diest in thine unthankfulness , and thine ignorance makes thee away farewell .
when thou hast leisure , say thy prayers , when thou hast none , remember thy friends , get thee a good husband , and use him as he uses thee , so , farewell .
exit our remedies oft in ourselves do lie , which we ascribe to heaven the fated sky gives us free scope , only doth backward pull our slow designs when we ourselves are dull .
what power is it which mounts my love so high , that makes me see , and can not feed mine eye ?
the mightiest space in fortune nature brings to join like likes and kiss like native things .
impossible be strange attempts to those that weigh their pains in sense and do suppose what hath been can not be who ever strove so show her merit , that did miss her love ?
the king disease my project may deceive me , but my intents are fix and will not leave me .

so is reported , sir .
nay , is most credible , we here received it a certainty , vouch from our cousin austria , with caution that the florentine will move us for speedy aid , wherein our dearest friend prejudicates the business and would seem to have us make denial .
his love and wisdom , approved so to your majesty , may plead for amplest credence .
he hath arm our answer , and florence is denied before he comes yet , for our gentlemen that mean to see the tuscan service , freely have they leave to stand on either part .
it well may serve a nursery to our gentry , who are sick for breathing and exploit .
what he comes here ?
enter bertram , lafeu , and parolles it is the count rousillon , my good lord , young bertram .
youth , thou thy father face , frank nature , rather curious than in haste , hath well composed thee .
thy father moral parts mayst thou inherit too !
welcome to paris .
my thanks and duty are your majesty .
i would i had that corporal soundness now , as when thy father and myself in friendship first tried our soldiership !
he did look far into the service of the time and was discipled of the bravest he lasted long , but on us both did haggish age steal on and wore us out of act .
it much repairs me to talk of your good father .
in his youth he had the wit which i can well observe in our young lords , but they may jest till their own scorn return to them unnoted ere they can hide their levity in honour , so like a courtier , contempt nor bitterness were in his pride or sharpness , if they were , his equal had awaked them , and his honour , clock to itself , knew the true minute when exception bid him speak , and at this time his tongue obey his hand who were below him he used as creatures of another place and bow his eminent top to their low ranks , making them proud of his humility , in their poor praise he humbled .
such a man might be a copy to these younger times , which , follow well , would demonstrate them now but goers backward .
his good remembrance , sir , lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb , so in approof lives not his epitaph as in your royal speech .
would i were with him !
he would always say methinks i hear him now , his plausive words he scatter not in ears , but grafted them , to grow there and to bear , me not live , ' this his good melancholy oft began , on the catastrophe and heel of pastime , when it was out , me not live , ' quoth he , my flame lacks oil , to be the snuff of younger spirits , whose apprehensive senses all but new things disdain , whose judgments are mere fathers of their garments , whose constancies expire before their fashions . '
this he wish , i after him do after him wish too , since i nor wax nor honey can bring home , i quickly were dissolved from my hive , to give some labourers room .
you are loved , sir they that least lend it you shall lack you first .
i fill a place , i .
how long , count , since the physician at your father died ?
he was much famed .
some six months since , my lord .
if he were living , i would try him yet .
lend me an arm , the rest have worn me out with several applications , nature and sickness debate it at their leisure .
welcome , count , my son no dearer .
thank your majesty .

madam , the care i have had to even your content , i wish might be found in the calendar of my past endeavours , for then we wound our modesty and make foul the clearness of our deservings , when of ourselves we publish them .
what does this knave here ?
get you gone , sirrah the complaints i have heard of you i do not all believe is my slowness that i do not , for i know you lack not folly to commit them , and have ability enough to make such knaveries yours .
is not unknown to you , madam , i am a poor fellow .
well , sir .
no , madam , is not so well that i am poor , though many of the rich are damned but , if i may have your ladyship good will to go to the world , isbel the woman and i will do as we may .
wilt thou needs be a beggar ?
i do beg your good will in this case .
in what case ?
in isbel case and mine own .
service is no heritage and i think i shall never have the blessing of god till i have issue o ' my body , for they say barnes are blessings .
tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry .
my poor body , madam , requires it i am driven on by the flesh , and he must needs go that the devil drives .
is this all your worship reason ?
faith , madam , i have other holy reasons such as they are .
may the world know them ?
i have been , madam , a wicked creature , as you and all flesh and blood are , and , indeed , i do marry that i may repent .
thy marriage , sooner than thy wickedness .
i am out o ' friends , madam , and i hope to have friends for my wife sake .
such friends are thine enemies , knave .
you shallow , madam , in great friends , for the knaves come to do that for me which i am aweary of .
he that ears my land spares my team and gives me leave to in the crop , if i be his cuckold , he my drudge he that comforts my wife is the cherisher of my flesh and blood , he that cherishes my flesh and blood loves my flesh and blood , he that loves my flesh and blood is my friend ergo , he that kisses my wife is my friend .
if men could be contented to be what they are , there were no fear in marriage , for young charbon the puritan and old poysam the papist , their hearts are severed in religion , their heads are both one , they may jowl horns together , like any deer i ' the herd .
wilt thou ever be a and calumnious knave ?
a prophet i , madam , and i speak the truth the next way for i the ballad will repeat , which men full true shall find , your marriage comes by destiny , your cuckoo sings by kind .
get you gone , sir , i talk with you more anon .
may it please you , madam , that he bid helen come to you of her i am to speak .
sirrah , tell my gentlewoman i would speak with her , helen , i mean .
was this fair face the cause , quoth she , why the grecians sacked troy ?
fond done , done fond , was this king priam joy ?
with that she sighed as she stood , with that she sighed as she stood , and gave this sentence then , among nine bad if one be good , among nine bad if one be good , there yet one good in ten .
what , one good in ten ?
you corrupt the song , sirrah .
one good woman in ten , madam , which is a purifying o ' the song would god would serve the world so all the year !
find no fault with the , if i were the parson .
one in ten , quoth a ' !
an we might have a good woman born but one every blazing star , or at an earthquake , mend the lottery well a man may draw his heart out , ere a ' pluck one .
you be gone , sir knave , and do as i command you .
that man should be at woman command , and yet no hurt done !
though honesty be no puritan , yet it will do no hurt , it will wear the surplice of humility over the black gown of a big heart .
i am going , forsooth the business is for helen to come hither .
exit well , now .
i know , madam , you love your gentlewoman entirely .
faith , i do her father bequeathed her to me , and she herself , without other advantage , may lawfully make title to as much love as she finds there is more owing her than is paid , and more shall be paid her than she demand .
madam , i was very late more near her than i think she wished me alone she was , and did communicate to herself her own words to her own ears , she thought , i dare vow for her , they touched not any stranger sense .
her matter was , she loved your son fortune , she said , was no goddess , that had put such difference betwixt their two estates , love no god , that would not extend his might , only where qualities were level , dian no queen of virgins , that would suffer her poor knight surprised , without rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward .
this she delivered in the most bitter touch of sorrow that i heard virgin exclaim in which i held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal , sithence , in the loss that may happen , it concerns you something to know it .
you have discharged this honestly , keep it to yourself many likelihoods informed me of this before , which hung so tottering in the balance that i could neither believe nor misdoubt .
pray you , leave me stall this in your bosom , and i thank you for your honest care i will speak with you further anon .
exit steward enter helena even so it was with me when i was young if ever we are nature , these are ours , this thorn doth to our rose of youth rightly belong , our blood to us , this to our blood is born , it is the show and seal of nature truth , where love strong passion is impress in youth by our remembrances of days foregone , such were our faults , or then we thought them none .
her eye is sick o i observe her now .
what is your pleasure , madam ?
you know , helen , i am a mother to you .
mine honourable mistress .
nay , a mother why not a mother ?
when i said ' a mother , ' methought you saw a serpent what in , ' that you start at it ?
i say , i am your mother , and put you in the catalogue of those that were enwombed mine is often seen adoption strives with nature and choice breeds a native slip to us from foreign seeds you oppress me with a mother groan , yet i express to you a mother care god mercy , maiden !
does it curd thy blood to say i am thy mother ?
what the matter , that this distemper messenger of wet , the iris , rounds thine eye ?
why ?
that you are my daughter ?
that i am not .
i say , i am your mother .
pardon , madam , the count rousillon can not be my brother i am from humble , he from honour name , no note upon my parents , his all noble my master , my dear lord he is , and i his servant live , and will his vassal die he must not be my brother .
nor i your mother ?
you are my mother , madam , would you were , so that my lord your son were not my brother , indeed my mother !
or were you both our mothers , i care no more for than i do for heaven , so i were not his sister .
ca no other , but , i your daughter , he must be my brother ?
yes , helen , you might be my god shield you mean it not !
daughter and mother so strive upon your pulse .
what , pale again ?
my fear hath catch your fondness now i see the mystery of your loneliness , and find your salt tears ' head now to all sense is gross you love my son , invention is ashamed , against the proclamation of thy passion , to say thou dost not therefore tell me true , but tell me then , is so , for , look thy cheeks confess it , th ' one to th ' other , and thine eyes see it so grossly shown in thy behaviors that in their kind they speak it only sin and hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue , that truth should be suspected .
speak , so ?
if it be so , you have wound a goodly clew , if it be not , , i charge thee , as heaven shall work in me for thine avail , tell me truly .
good madam , pardon me !
do you love my son ?
your pardon , noble mistress !
love you my son ?
do not you love him , madam ?
go not about , my love hath i a bond , whereof the world takes note come , come , disclose the state of your affection , for your passions have to the full appeach .
then , i confess , here on my knee , before high heaven and you , that before you , and next unto high heaven , i love your son .
my friends were poor , but honest , so my love be not offended , for it hurts not him that he is loved of me i follow him not by any token of presumptuous suit , nor would i have him till i do deserve him , yet never know how that desert should be .
i know i love in vain , strive against hope , yet in this captious and intenible sieve i still pour in the waters of my love and lack not to lose still thus , , religious in mine error , i adore the sun , that looks upon his worshipper , but knows of him no more .
my dearest madam , let not your hate encounter with my love for loving where you do but if yourself , whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth , did ever in so true a flame of liking wish chastely and love dearly , that your dian was both herself and love o , then , give pity to her , whose state is such that can not choose but lend and give where she is sure to lose , that seeks not to find that her search implies , but lives sweetly where she dies !
had you not lately an intent , speak truly , to go to paris ?
madam , i had .
wherefore ?
tell true .
i will tell truth , by grace itself i swear .
you know my father left me some prescriptions of rare and proved effects , such as his reading and manifest experience had collected for general sovereignty , and that he will me in reservation to bestow them , as notes whose faculties inclusive were more than they were in note amongst the rest , there is a remedy , approved , set down , to cure the desperate languishings whereof the king is render lost .
this was your motive for paris , was it ?
speak .
my lord your son made me to think of this , else paris and the medicine and the king had from the conversation of my thoughts haply been absent then .
but think you , helen , if you should tender your supposed aid , he would receive it ?
he and his physicians are of a mind , he , that they can not help him , they , that they can not help how shall they credit a poor unlearned virgin , when the schools , embowell of their doctrine , have left off the danger to itself ?
there something i , more than my father skill , which was the greatest of his profession , that his good receipt shall for my legacy be sanctified by the luckiest stars in heaven and , would your honour but give me leave to try success , venture the life of mine on his grace cure by such a day and hour .
dost thou ?
ay , madam , knowingly .
why , helen , thou shalt have my leave and love , means and attendants and my loving greetings to those of mine in court i stay at home and pray god blessing into thy attempt be gone , and be sure of this , what i can help thee to thou shalt not miss .

commit it , count .
i am your accessary , and so , farewell .
i grow to you , and our parting is a tortured body .
farewell , captain .
sweet monsieur parolles !
noble heroes , my sword and yours are kin .
good sparks and lustrous , a word , good metals you shall find in the regiment of the spinii one captain spurio , with his cicatrice , an emblem of war , here on his sinister cheek , it was this very sword entrenched it say to him , i live , and observe his reports for me .
we shall , noble captain .
exeunt lords mars dote on you for his novices !
what will ye do ?
stay the king .
king .
bertram and parolles retire to bertram use a more spacious ceremony to the noble lords , you have restrained yourself within the list of too cold an adieu be more expressive to them for they wear themselves in the cap of the time , there do muster true gait , eat , speak , and move under the influence of the most received star , and though the devil lead the measure , such are to be followed after them , and take a more dilated farewell .
and i will do so .
worthy fellows , and like to prove most sinewy .
exeunt bertram and parolles enter lafeu kneeling pardon , my lord , for me and for my tidings .
i fee thee to stand up .
then here a man stands , that has brought his pardon .
i would you had kneel , my lord , to ask me mercy , and that at my bidding you could so stand up .
i would i had , so i had broke thy pate , and ask thee mercy .
good faith , across but , my good lord is thus , will you be cured of your infirmity ?
no .
o , will you eat no grapes , my royal fox ?
yes , but you will my noble grapes , an if my royal fox could reach them i have seen a medicine that able to breathe life into a stone , quicken a rock , and make you dance canary with spritely fire and motion , whose simple touch , is powerful to araise king pepin , nay , to give great charlemain a pen in hand , and write to her a .
what ' is this ?
why , doctor she my lord , there one arrived , if you will see her now , by my faith and honour , if seriously i may convey my thoughts in this my light deliverance , i have spoke with one that , in her sex , her years , profession , wisdom and constancy , hath amazed me more than i dare blame my weakness will you see her for that is her demand , and know her business ?
that done , laugh well at me .
now , good lafeu , bring in the admiration , that we with thee may spend our wonder too , or take off thine by wondering how thou it .
nay , i fit you , and not be all day neither .
exit thus he his special nothing ever prologues .
lafeu , with helena nay , come your ways .
this haste hath wings indeed .
nay , come your ways this is his majesty , say your mind to him a traitor you do look like , but such traitors his majesty seldom fears i am cressid uncle , that dare leave two together , fare you well .
exit now , fair one , does your business follow us ?
ay , my good lord .
gerard de narbon was my father , in what he did profess , well found .
i knew him .
the rather will i spare my praises towards him knowing him is enough .
on bed of death many receipts he gave me chiefly one .
which , as the dearest issue of his practise , and of his old experience the oily darling , he bade me store up , as a triple eye , safer than mine own two , more dear , i have so , and hearing your high majesty is touch with that malignant cause wherein the honour of my dear father gift stands chief in power , i come to tender it and my appliance with all bound humbleness .
we thank you , maiden , but may not be so credulous of cure , when our most learned doctors leave us and the congregated college have concluded that labouring art can never ransom nature from her inaidible estate , i say we must not so stain our judgment , or corrupt our hope , to prostitute our malady to empirics , or to dissever so our great self and our credit , to esteem a senseless help when help past sense we deem .
my duty then shall pay me for my pains i will no more enforce mine office on you .
humbly entreating from your royal thoughts a modest one , to bear me back again .
i can not give thee less , to be call grateful thou to help me , and such thanks i give as one near death to those that wish him live but what at full i know , thou no part , i knowing all my peril , thou no art .
what i can do can do no hurt to try , since you set up your rest remedy .
he that of greatest works is finisher oft does them by the weakest minister so holy writ in babes hath judgment shown , when judges have been babes , great floods have flown from simple sources , and great seas have dried when miracles have by the greatest been denied .
oft expectation fails and most oft there where most it promises , and oft it hits where hope is coldest and despair most fits .
i must not hear thee , fare thee well , kind maid , thy pains not used must by thyself be paid proffers not took reap thanks for their reward .
inspired merit so by breath is barr it is not so with him that all things knows as is with us that square our guess by shows , but most it is presumption in us when the help of heaven we count the act of men .
dear sir , to my endeavours give consent , of heaven , not me , make an experiment .
i am not an impostor that proclaim myself against the level of mine aim , but know i think and think i know most sure my art is not past power nor you past cure .
are thou so confident ?
within what space hopest thou my cure ?
the grace lending grace ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring their fiery torcher his diurnal ring , ere twice in murk and occidental damp moist hesperus hath quench his sleepy lamp , or four and twenty times the pilot glass hath told the thievish minutes how they pass , what is infirm from your sound parts shall fly , health shall live free and sickness freely die .
upon thy certainty and confidence what darest thou venture ?
tax of impudence , a strumpet boldness , a divulged shame traduced by odious ballads my maiden name sear otherwise , nay , worse if worse extended with vilest torture let my life be ended .
methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak his powerful sound within an organ weak and what impossibility would slay in common sense , sense saves another way .
thy life is dear , for all that life can rate worth name of life in thee hath estimate , youth , beauty , wisdom , courage , all that happiness and prime can happy call thou this to hazard needs must intimate skill infinite or monstrous desperate .
sweet practiser , thy physic i will try , that ministers thine own death if i die .
if i break time , or flinch in property of what i spoke , unpitied let me die , and well deserved not helping , death my fee , but , if i help , what do you promise me ?
make thy demand .
but will you make it even ?
ay , by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven .
then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand what husband in thy power i will command exempted be from me the arrogance to choose from forth the royal blood of france , my low and humble name to propagate with any branch or image of thy state , but such a one , thy vassal , whom i know is free for me to ask , thee to bestow .
here is my hand , the premises observed , thy will by my performance shall be served so make the choice of thy own time , for i , thy resolved patient , on thee still rely .
more should i question thee , and more i must , though more to know could not be more to trust , from whence thou camest , how tended on but rest unquestion welcome and undoubted blest .
give me some help here , ho !
if thou proceed as high as word , my deed shall match thy meed .

rousillon .
the count palace .
enter countess and clown come on , sir , i shall now put you to the height of your breeding .
i will show myself highly fed and lowly taught i know my business is but to the court .
to the court !
why , what place make you special , when you put off that with such contempt ?
but to the court !
truly , madam , if god have lent a man any manners , he may easily put it off at court he that can not make a leg , put off cap , kiss his hand and say nothing , has neither leg , hands , lip , nor cap , and indeed such a fellow , to say precisely , were not for the court , but for me , i have an answer will serve all men .
marry , that a bountiful answer that fits all questions .
it is like a barber chair that fits all buttocks , the , the , the brawn buttock , or any buttock .
will your answer serve fit to all questions ?
as fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney , as your french crown for your taffeta punk , as tib rush for tom forefinger , as a pancake for shrove tuesday , a morris for , as the nail to his hole , the cuckold to his horn , as a scolding queen to a wrangling knave , as the nun lip to the friar mouth , nay , as the pudding to his skin .
have you , i say , an answer of such fitness for all questions ?
from below your duke to beneath your constable , it will fit any question .
it must be an answer of most monstrous size that must fit all demands .
but a trifle neither , in good faith , if the learned should speak truth of it here it is , and all that belongs .
ask me if i am a courtier it shall do you no harm to learn .
to be young again , if we could i will be a fool in question , hoping to be the wiser by your answer .
i pray you , sir , are you a courtier ?
o lord , sir !
there a simple putting off .
more , more , a hundred of them .
sir , i am a poor friend of yours , that loves you .
o lord , sir !
thick , thick , spare not me .
i think , sir , you can eat none of this homely meat .
o lord , sir !
nay , put me , i warrant you .
you were lately whipped , sir , as i think .
o lord , sir !
spare not me .
do you cry , ' o lord , sir ! '
at your whipping , and not me ? '
indeed your ' o lord , sir ! '
is very sequent to your whipping you would answer very well to a whipping , if you were but bound .
i had worse luck in my life in my ' o lord , sir ! '
i see things may serve long , but not serve ever .
i play the noble housewife with the time to entertai so merrily with a fool .
o lord , sir !
why , serves well again .
an end , sir , to your business .
give helen this , and urge her to a present answer back commend me to my kinsmen and my son this is not much .
not much commendation to them .
not much employment for you you understand me ?
most fruitfully i am there before my legs .
haste you again .
exeunt severally scene iii .
paris .
the king palace .
enter bertram , lafeu , and parolles they say miracles are past , and we have our philosophical persons , to make modern and familiar , things supernatural and causeless .
hence is it that we make trifles of terrors , ensconcing ourselves into seeming knowledge , when we should submit ourselves to an unknown fear .
why , is the rarest argument of wonder that hath shot out in our latter times .
and so is .
to be relinquish of the artists , so i say .
both of galen and paracelsus .
so i say .
of all the learned and authentic fellows , right , so i say .
that gave him out incurable , why , there is , so say i too .
not to be helped , right , as , a man assured of a uncertain life , and sure death .
just , you say well , so would i have said .
i may truly say , it is a novelty to the world .
it is , indeed if you will have it in showing , you shall read it in what do you call there ?
a showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor .
that it , i would have said the very same .
why , your dolphin is not lustier me , i speak in respect nay , is strange , is very strange , that is the brief and the tedious of it , and he of a most facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the very hand of heaven .
ay , so i say .
in a most weak pausing and debile minister , great power , great transcendence which should , indeed , give us a further use to be made than alone the recovery of the king , as to be pausing generally thankful .
i would have said it , you say well .
here comes the king .
enter king , helena , and attendants .
lafeu and parolles retire lustig , as the dutchman says i like a maid the better , whilst i have a tooth in my head why , he able to lead her a coranto .
mort du vinaigre !
is not this helen ?
god , i think so .
go , call before me all the lords in court .
sit , my preserver , by thy patient side , and with this healthful hand , whose banish sense thou hast repeal , a second time receive the confirmation of my promised gift , which but attends thy naming .
enter three or four lords fair maid , send forth thine eye this youthful parcel of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing , whom both sovereign power and father voice i have to use thy frank election make , thou hast power to choose , and they none to forsake .
to each of you one fair and virtuous mistress fall , when love please !
marry , to each , but one !
give bay curtal and his furniture , my mouth no more were broken than these boys ' , and writ as little beard .
peruse them well not one of those but had a noble father .
gentlemen , heaven hath through me restored the king to health .
we understand it , and thank heaven for you .
i am a simple maid , and therein wealthiest , that i protest i simply am a maid .
please it your majesty , i have done already the blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me , blush that thou shouldst choose , but , be refused , let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever , we come there again . '
make choice , and , see , who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me .
now , dian , from thy altar do i fly , and to imperial love , that god most high , do my sighs stream .
sir , will you hear my suit ?
and grant it .
thanks , sir , all the rest is mute .
i had rather be in this choice than throw for my life .
the honour , sir , that flames in your fair eyes , before i speak , too threateningly replies love make your fortunes twenty times above her that so wishes and her humble love !
no better , if you please .
my wish receive , which great love grant !
and so , i take my leave .
do all they deny her ?
an they were sons of mine , i have them whipped , or i would send them to the turk , to make eunuchs of .
be not afraid that i your hand should take , i never do you wrong for your own sake blessing upon your vows !
and in your bed find fairer fortune , if you ever wed !
these boys are boys of ice , they none have her sure , they are bastards to the english , the french got .
you are too young , too happy , and too good , to make yourself a son out of my blood .
fair one , i think not so .
there one grape yet , i am sure thy father drunk wine but if thou not an ass , i am a youth of fourteen , i have known thee already .
to bertram i dare not say i take you , but i give me and my service , ever whilst i live , into your guiding power .
this is the man .
why , then , young bertram , take her , she thy wife .
my wife , my liege !
i shall beseech your highness , in such a business give me leave to use the help of mine own eyes .
thou not , bertram , what she has done for me ?
yes , my good lord , but never hope to know why i should marry her .
thou she has raised me from my sickly bed .
but follows it , my lord , to bring me down must answer for your raising ?
i know her well she had her breeding at my father charge .
a poor physician daughter my wife !
disdain rather corrupt me ever !
is only title thou in her , the which i can build up .
strange is it that our bloods , of colour , weight , and heat , pour all together , would quite confound distinction , yet stand off in differences so mighty .
if she be all that is virtuous , save what thou dislikest , a poor physician daughter , thou dislikest of virtue for the name but do not so from lowest place when virtuous things proceed , the place is dignified by the doer deed where great additions swell , and virtue none , it is a dropsied honour .
good alone is good without a name .
vileness is so the property by what it is should go , not by the title .
she is young , wise , fair , in these to nature she immediate heir , and these breed honour that is honour scorn , which challenges itself as honour born and is not like the sire honours thrive , when rather from our acts we them derive than our foregoers the mere word a slave debosh on every tomb , on every grave a lying trophy , and as oft is dumb where dust and damn oblivion is the tomb of honour bones indeed .
what should be said ?
if thou canst like this creature as a maid , i can create the rest virtue and she is her own dower , honour and wealth from me .
i can not love her , nor will strive to .
thou thyself , if thou shouldst strive to choose .
that you are well restored , my lord , i glad let the rest go .
my honour at the stake , which to defeat , i must produce my power .
here , take her hand , proud scornful boy , unworthy this good gift , that dost in vile misprision shackle up my love and her desert , that canst not dream , we , poising us in her defective scale , shall weigh thee to the beam , that wilt not know , it is in us to plant thine honour where we please to have it grow .
cheque thy contempt obey our will , which travails in thy good believe not thy disdain , but presently do thine own fortunes that obedient right which both thy duty owes and our power claims , or i will throw thee from my care for ever into the staggers and the careless lapse of youth and ignorance , both my revenge and hate loosing upon thee , in the name of justice , without all terms of pity .
speak , thine answer .
pardon , my gracious lord , for i submit my fancy to your eyes when i consider what great creation and what dole of honour flies where you bid it , i find that she , which late was in my nobler thoughts most base , is now the praised of the king , who , so ennobled , is as born so .
take her by the hand , and tell her she is thine to whom i promise a counterpoise , if not to thy estate a balance more replete .
i take her hand .
good fortune and the favour of the king smile upon this contract , whose ceremony shall seem expedient on the brief , and be perform the solemn feast shall more attend upon the coming space , expecting absent friends .
as thou lovest her , thy love to me religious , else , does err .
exeunt all but lafeu and parolles advancing do you hear , monsieur ?
a word with you .
your pleasure , sir ?
your lord and master did well to make his recantation .
recantation !
my lord !
my master !
ay , is it not a language i speak ?
a most harsh one , and not to be understood without bloody succeeding .
my master !
are you companion to the count rousillon ?
to any count , to all counts , to what is man .
to what is count man count master is of another style .
you are too old , sir , let it satisfy you , you are too old .
i must tell thee , sirrah , i write man , to which title age can not bring thee .
what i dare too well do , i dare not do .
i did think thee , for two ordinaries , to be a pretty wise fellow , thou didst make tolerable vent of thy travel , it might pass yet the scarfs and the bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen .
i have now found thee , when i lose thee again , i care not yet art thou good for nothing but taking up , and that scarce worth .
hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee , do not plunge thyself too far in anger , lest thou hasten thy trial , which if lord have mercy on thee for a hen !
so , my good window of lattice , fare thee well thy casement i need not open , for i look through thee .
give me thy hand .
my lord , you give me most egregious indignity .
ay , with all my heart , and thou art worthy of it .
i have not , my lord , deserved it .
yes , good faith , every dram of it , and i will not bate thee a scruple .
well , i shall be wiser .
even as soon as thou canst , for thou hast to pull at a smack o ' the contrary .
if ever thou bound in thy scarf and beaten , thou shalt find what it is to be proud of thy bondage .
i have a desire to hold my acquaintance with thee , or rather my knowledge , that i may say in the default , he is a man i know .
my lord , you do me most insupportable vexation .
i would it were for thy sake , and my poor doing eternal for doing i am past as i will by thee , in what motion age will give me leave .
exit well , thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off me , scurvy , old , filthy , scurvy lord !
well , i must be patient , there is no fettering of authority .
i beat him , by my life , if i can meet him with any convenience , an he were double and double a lord .
i have no more pity of his age than i would of i beat him , an if i could but meet him again .
lafeu sirrah , your lord and master married , there news for you you have a new mistress .
i most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make some reservation of your wrongs he is my good lord whom i serve above is my master .
who ?
god ?
ay , sir .
the devil it is that thy master .
why dost thou garter up thy arms o ' this fashion ?
dost make hose of sleeves ?
do other servants so ?
thou wert best set thy lower part where thy nose stands .
by mine honour , if i were but two hours younger , beat thee methinks , thou art a general offence , and every man should beat thee i think thou wast created for men to breathe themselves upon thee .
this is hard and undeserved measure , my lord .
go to , sir , you were beaten in italy for picking a kernel out of a pomegranate , you are a vagabond and no true traveller you are more saucy with lords and honourable personages than the commission of your birth and virtue gives you heraldry .
you are not worth another word , else call you knave .
i leave you .
exit good , very good , it is so then good , very good , let it be concealed awhile .
bertram undone , and forfeited to cares for ever !
what the matter , ?
although before the solemn priest i have sworn , i will not bed her .
what , what , ?
o my parolles , they have married me !
i to the tuscan wars , and never bed her .
france is a , and it no more merits the tread of a man foot to the wars !
there letters from my mother what the import is , i know not yet .
ay , that would be known .
to the wars , my boy , to the wars !
he wears his honour in a box unseen , that hugs his here at home , spending his manly marrow in her arms , which should sustain the bound and high curvet of mars fiery steed .
to other regions france is a stable , we that dwell i jades , therefore , to the war !
it shall be so i send her to my house , acquaint my mother with my hate to her , and wherefore i am fled , write to the king that which i durst not speak , his present gift shall furnish me to those italian fields , where noble fellows strike war is no strife to the dark house and the detested wife .
will this capriccio hold in thee ?
art sure ?
go with me to my chamber , and advise me .
i send her straight away i to the wars , she to her single sorrow .
why , these balls bound , there noise in it .
is hard a young man married is a man that marr therefore away , and leave her bravely , go the king has done you wrong but , hush , is so .

she is not well , but yet she has her health she very merry , but yet she is not well but thanks be given , she very well and wants nothing i ' , the world , but yet she is not well .
if she be very well , what does she ail , that she not very well ?
truly , she very well indeed , but for two things .
what two things ?
one , that she not in heaven , whither god send her quickly !
the other that she in earth , from whence god send her quickly !
enter parolles bless you , my fortunate lady !
i hope , sir , i have your good will to have mine own good fortunes .
you had my prayers to lead them on , and to keep them on , have them still .
o , my knave , how does my old lady ?
so that you had her wrinkles and i her money , i would she did as you say .
why , i say nothing .
marry , you are the wiser man , for many a man tongue shakes out his master undoing to say nothing , to do nothing , to know nothing , and to have nothing , is to be a great part of your title , which is within a very little of nothing .
away !
a knave .
you should have said , sir , before a knave a knave , that , before me a knave this had been truth , sir .
go to , thou art a witty fool , i have found thee .
did you find me in yourself , sir ?
or were you taught to find me ?
the search , sir , was profitable , and much fool may you find in you , even to the world pleasure and the increase of laughter .
a good knave , i ' faith , and well fed .
madam , my lord will go away , a very serious business calls on him .
the great prerogative and rite of love , which , as your due , time claims , he does acknowledge , but puts it off to a compell restraint , whose want , and whose delay , is strew with sweets , which they distil now in the curbed time , to make the coming hour with joy and pleasure drown the brim .
what his will else ?
that you will take your instant leave o ' the king and make this haste as your own good proceeding , strengthen with what apology you think may make it probable need .
what more commands he ?
that , having this obtain , you presently attend his further pleasure .
in every thing i wait upon his will .
i shall report it so .

and by other warranted testimony .
then my dial goes not true i took this lark for a bunting .
i do assure you , my lord , he is very great in knowledge and accordingly valiant .
i have then sinned against his experience and transgressed against his valour , and my state that way is dangerous , since i can not yet find in my heart to repent .
here he comes i pray you , make us friends , i will pursue the amity .
enter parolles to bertram these things shall be done , sir .
pray you , sir , who his tailor ?
sir ?
o , i know him well , i , sir , he , sir , a good workman , a very good tailor .
aside to parolles is she gone to the king ?
she is .
will she away ?
as you have her .
i have writ my letters , casketed my treasure , given order for our horses , and , when i should take possession of the bride , end ere i do begin .
a good traveller is something at the latter end of a dinner , but one that lies three thirds and uses a known truth to pass a thousand nothings with , should be once heard and thrice beaten .
god save you , captain .
is there any unkindness between my lord and you , monsieur ?
i know not how i have deserved to run into my lord displeasure .
you have made shift to run into , boots and spurs and all , like him that leaped into the custard , and out of it you run again , rather than suffer question for your residence .
it may be you have mistaken him , my lord .
and shall do so ever , though i took him at prayers .
fare you well , my lord , and believe this of me , there can be no kernel in this light nut , the soul of this man is his clothes .
trust him not in matter of heavy consequence , i have kept of them tame , and know their natures .
farewell , monsieur i have spoken better of you than you have or will to deserve at my hand , but we must do good against evil .
exit an idle lord .
i swear .
i think so .
why , do you not know him ?
yes , i do know him well , and common speech gives him a worthy pass .
here comes my clog .
enter helena i have , sir , as i was commanded from you , spoke with the king and have procured his leave for present parting , only he desires some private speech with you .
i shall obey his will .
you must not marvel , helen , at my course , which holds not colour with the time , nor does the ministration and required office on my particular .
prepared i was not for such a business , therefore am i found so much unsettled this drives me to entreat you that presently you take our way for home , and rather muse than ask why i entreat you , for my respects are better than they seem and my appointments have in them a need greater than shows itself at the first view to you that know them not .
this to my mother giving a letter be two days ere i shall see you , so i leave you to your wisdom .
sir , i can nothing say , but that i am your most obedient servant .
come , come , no more of that .
and ever shall with true observance seek to eke out that wherein toward me my homely stars have fail to equal my great fortune .
let that go my haste is very great farewell , hie home .
pray , sir , your pardon .
well , what would you say ?
i am not worthy of the wealth i owe , nor dare i say is mine , and yet it is , but , like a timorous thief , most fain would steal what law does vouch mine own .
what would you have ?
something , and scarce so much nothing , indeed .
i would not tell you what i would , my lord faith yes , strangers and foes do sunder , and not kiss .
i pray you , stay not , but in haste to horse .
i shall not break your bidding , good my lord .
where are my other men , monsieur ?
farewell .
exit helena go thou toward home , where i will never come whilst i can shake my sword or hear the drum .
away , and for our flight .

so that from point to point now have you heard the fundamental reasons of this war , whose great decision hath much blood let forth and more thirsts after .
holy seems the quarrel upon your grace part , black and fearful on the opposer .
therefore we marvel much our cousin france would in so just a business shut his bosom against our borrowing prayers .
good my lord , the reasons of our state i can not yield , but like a common and an outward man , that the great figure of a council frames by motion therefore dare not say what i think of it , since i have found myself in my incertain grounds to fail as often as i guess .
be it his pleasure .
but i am sure the younger of our nature , that surfeit on their ease , will day by day come here for physic .
welcome shall they be , and all the honours that can fly from us shall on them settle .

to fly the favours of so good a king , to pluck his indignation on thy head by the misprising of a maid too virtuous for the contempt of empire .
clown o madam , yonder is heavy news within between two soldiers and my young lady !
what is the matter ?
nay , there is some comfort in the news , some comfort , your son will not be killed so soon as i thought he would .
why should he be killed ?
so say i , madam , if he run away , as i hear he does the danger is in standing , that the loss of men , though it be the getting of children .
here they come will tell you more for my part , i only hear your son was run away .
exit enter helena , and two gentlemen save you , good madam .
madam , my lord is gone , for ever gone .
do not say so .
think upon patience .
pray you , gentlemen , i have felt so many quirks of joy and grief , that the first face of neither , on the start , can woman me where is my son , i pray you ?
madam , he gone to serve the duke of florence we met him thitherward , for thence we came , and , after some dispatch in hand at court , thither we bend again .
look on his letter , madam , here my passport .
reads when thou canst get the ring upon my finger which never shall come off , and show me a child begotten of thy body that i am father to , then call me husband but in such a ' i write a . '
this is a dreadful sentence .
brought you this letter , gentlemen ?
ay , madam , and for the contents ' sake are sorry for our pain .
i prithee , lady , have a better cheer , if thou engrossest all the griefs are thine , thou me of a moiety he was my son , but i do wash his name out of my blood , and thou art all my child .
towards florence is he ?
ay , madam .
and to be a soldier ?
such is his noble purpose , and believe , the duke will lay upon him all the honour that good convenience claims .
return you thither ?
ay , madam , with the swiftest wing of speed .
reads till i have no wife i have nothing in france .
is bitter .
find you that there ?
ay , madam .
is but the boldness of his hand , haply , which his heart was not consenting to .
nothing in france , until he have no wife !
there nothing here that is too good for him but only she , and she deserves a lord that twenty such rude boys might tend upon and call her hourly mistress .
who was with him ?
a servant only , and a gentleman which i have sometime known .
parolles , was it not ?
ay , my good lady , he .
a very tainted fellow , and full of wickedness .
my son corrupts a nature with his inducement .
indeed , good lady , the fellow has a deal of that too much , which holds him much to have .
you welcome , gentlemen .
i will entreat you , when you see my son , to tell him that his sword can never win the honour that he loses more i entreat you written to bear along .
we serve you , madam , in that and all your worthiest affairs .
not so , but as we change our courtesies .
will you draw near !
exeunt countess and gentlemen i have no wife , i have nothing in france . '
nothing in france , until he has no wife !
thou shalt have none , rousillon , none in france , then hast thou all again .
poor lord !
i that chase thee from thy country and expose those tender limbs of thine to the event of the war ?
and is it i that drive thee from the sportive court , where thou wast shot at with fair eyes , to be the mark of smoky muskets ?
o you leaden messengers , that ride upon the violent speed of fire , fly with false aim , move the air , that sings with piercing , do not touch my lord .
whoever shoots at him , i set him there , whoever charges on his forward breast , i am the caitiff that do hold him , and , though i kill him not , i am the cause his death was so effected better i met the ravin lion when he roar with sharp constraint of hunger , better that all the miseries which nature owes were mine at once .
no , come thou home , rousillon , whence honour but of danger wins a scar , as oft it loses all i will be gone , my being here it is that holds thee hence shall i stay here to ?
no , no , although the air of paradise did fan the house and angels officed all i will be gone , that pitiful rumour may report my flight , to consolate thine ear .
come , night , end , day !
for with the dark , poor thief , i steal away .

write , write , that from the bloody course of war my dearest master , your dear son , may hie bless him at home in peace , whilst i from far his name with zealous fervor sanctify his taken labours bid him me forgive , i , his despiteful juno , sent him forth from courtly friends , with camping foes to live , where death and danger dogs the heels of worth he is too good and fair for death and me whom i myself embrace , to set him free .
ah , what sharp stings are in her mildest words !
rinaldo , you did never lack advice so much , as letting her pass so had i spoke with her , i could have well diverted her intents , which thus she hath prevented .
pardon me , madam if i had given you this at , she might have been , and yet she writes , pursuit would be but vain .
what angel shall bless this unworthy husband ?
he can not thrive , unless her prayers , whom heaven delights to hear and loves to grant , reprieve him from the wrath of greatest justice .
write , write , rinaldo , to this unworthy husband of his wife , let every word weigh heavy of her worth that he does weigh too light my greatest grief .
though little he do feel it , set down sharply .
dispatch the most convenient messenger when haply he shall hear that she is gone , he will return , and hope i may that she , hearing so much , will speed her foot again , led hither by pure love which of them both is dearest to me .

they say the french count has done most honourable service .
it is reported that he has taken their greatest commander , and that with his own hand he slew the duke brother .
tucket we have lost our labour , they are gone a contrary way hark !
you may know by their trumpets .
come , let return again , and suffice ourselves with the report of it .
well , diana , take heed of this french earl the honour of a maid is her name , and no legacy is so rich as honesty .
i have told my neighbour how you have been solicited by a gentleman his companion .
i know that knave , hang him !
one parolles a filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the young earl .
beware of them , diana , their promises , enticements , oaths , tokens , and all these engines of lust , are not the things they go under many a maid hath been seduced by them , and the misery is , example , that so terrible shows in the wreck of maidenhood , can not for all that dissuade succession , but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten them .
i hope i need not to advise you further , but i hope your own grace will keep you where you are , though there were no further danger known but the modesty which is so lost .
you shall not need to fear me .
i hope so .
enter helena , disguised like a pilgrim look , here comes a pilgrim i know she will lie at my house , thither they send one another i question her .
god save you , pilgrim !
whither are you bound ?

at the saint francis here beside the port .
is this the way ?
ay , marry , .

if you will tarry , holy pilgrim , but till the troops come by , i will conduct you where you shall be lodged , the rather , for i think i know your hostess as ample as myself .
is it yourself ?
if you shall please so , pilgrim .
i thank you , and will stay upon your leisure .
you came , i think , from france ?
i did so .
here you shall see a countryman of yours that has done worthy service .
his name , i pray you .
the count rousillon know you such a one ?
but by the ear , that hears most nobly of him his face i know not .
he is , he bravely taken here .
he stole from france , as is reported , for the king had married him against his liking think you it is so ?
ay , surely , mere the truth i know his lady .
there is a gentleman that serves the count reports but coarsely of her .
what his name ?
monsieur parolles .
o , i believe with him , in argument of praise , or to the worth of the great count himself , she is too mean to have her name repeated all her deserving is a reserved honesty , and that i have not heard examined .
alas , poor lady !
is a hard bondage to become the wife of a detesting lord .
i warrant , good creature , she is , her heart weighs sadly this young maid might do her a shrewd turn , if she pleased .
how do you mean ?
may be the amorous count solicits her in the unlawful purpose .
he does indeed , and brokes with all that can in such a suit corrupt the tender honour of a maid but she is arm for him and keeps her guard in honestest defence .
the gods forbid else !
so , now they come drum and colours enter bertram , parolles , and the whole army that is antonio , the duke eldest son , that , escalus .
which is the frenchman ?
he , that with the plume is a most gallant fellow .
i would he loved his wife if he were honester he were much goodlier not a handsome gentleman ?
i like him well .
is pity he is not honest yond that same knave that leads him to these places were i his lady , i would poison that vile rascal .
which is he ?

perchance he hurt i ' the battle .

we take your offer kindly .
exeunt scene vi .
camp before florence .
enter bertram and the two french lords nay , good my lord , put him , let him have his way .
if your lordship find him not a hilding , hold me no more in your respect .
on my life , my lord , a bubble .
do you think i am so far deceived in him ?
believe it , my lord , in mine own direct knowledge , without any malice , but to speak of him as my kinsman , he a most notable coward , an infinite and endless liar , an hourly , the owner of no one good quality worthy your lordship entertainment .
it were fit you knew him , lest , reposing too far in his virtue , which he hath not , he might at some great and trusty business in a main danger fail you .
i would i knew in what particular action to try him .
none better than to let him fetch off his drum , which you hear him so confidently undertake to do .
i , with a troop of florentines , will suddenly surprise him , such i will have , whom i am sure he knows not from the enemy we will bind and hoodwink him so , that he shall suppose no other but that he is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries , when we bring him to our own tents .
be but your lordship present at his examination if he do not , for the promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of base fear , offer to betray you and deliver all the intelligence in his power against you , and that with the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath , never trust my judgment in any thing .
o , for the love of laughter , let him fetch his drum , he says he has a stratagem when your lordship sees the bottom of his success i , and to what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be melted , if you give him not john drum entertainment , your inclining can not be removed .
here he comes .
enter parolles aside to bertram o , for the love of laughter , hinder not the honour of his design let him fetch off his drum in any hand .
how now , monsieur !
this drum sticks sorely in your disposition .
a pox o , let it go , is but a drum .
a drum ' !
a drum ' ?
a drum so lost !
there was excellent command , to charge in with our horse upon our own wings , and to rend our own soldiers !
that was not to be blamed in the command of the service it was a disaster of war that caesar himself could not have prevented , if he had been there to command .
well , we can not greatly condemn our success some dishonour we had in the loss of that drum , but it is not to be recovered .
it might have been recovered .
it might , but it is not now .
it is to be recovered but that the merit of service is seldom attributed to the true and exact performer , i would have that drum or another , or jacet . '
why , if you have a stomach , , monsieur if you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instrument of honour again into his native quarter , be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on , i will grace the attempt for a worthy exploit if you speed well in it , the duke shall both speak of it .
and extend to you what further becomes his greatness , even to the utmost syllable of your worthiness .
by the hand of a soldier , i will undertake it .
but you must not now slumber in it .
i about it this evening and i will presently pen down my dilemmas , encourage myself in my certainty , put myself into my mortal preparation , and by midnight look to hear further from me .
may i be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it ?
i know not what the success will be , my lord , but the attempt i vow .
i know valiant , and , to the possibility of thy soldiership , will subscribe for thee .
farewell .
i love not many words .
exit no more than a fish loves water .
is not this a strange fellow , my lord , that so confidently seems to undertake this business , which he knows is not to be done , damns himself to do and dares better be damned than to ?
you do not know him , my lord , as we do certain it is that he will steal himself into a man favour and for a week escape a great deal of discoveries , but when you find him out , you have him ever after .
why , do you think he will make no deed at all of this that so seriously he does address himself unto ?
none in the world , but return with an invention and clap upon you two or three probable lies but we have almost embossed him , you shall see his fall , for indeed he is not for your lordship respect .
we make you some sport with the fox ere we case him .
he was first smoked by the old lord lafeu when his disguise and he is parted , tell me what a sprat you shall find him , which you shall see this very night .
i must go look my twigs he shall be caught .
your brother he shall go along with me .
please your lordship i leave you .
exit now will i lead you to the house , and show you the lass i spoke of .
but you say she honest .
that all the fault i spoke with her but once and found her wondrous cold , but i sent to her , by this same coxcomb that we have i ' the wind , tokens and letters which she did , and this is all i have done .
she a fair creature will you go see her ?
with all my heart , my lord .

enter helena and widow if you misdoubt me that i am not she , i know not how i shall assure you further , but i shall lose the grounds i work upon .
though my estate be fallen , i was well born , nothing acquainted with these businesses , and would not put my reputation now in any staining act .
nor would i wish you .
first , give me trust , the count he is my husband , and what to your sworn counsel i have spoken is so from word to word , and then you can not , by the good aid that i of you shall borrow , err in bestowing it .
i should believe you for you have show me that which well approves you great in fortune .
take this purse of gold , and let me buy your friendly help thus far , which i will and pay again when i have found it .
the count he wooes your daughter , lays down his wanton siege before her beauty , resolved to carry her let her in fine consent , as we direct her how is best to bear it .
now his important blood will nought deny that she demand a ring the county wears , that downward hath succeeded in his house from son to son , some four or five descents since the first father wore it this ring he holds in most rich choice , yet in his idle fire , to buy his will , it would not seem too dear , repented after .
now i see the bottom of your purpose .
you see it lawful , then it is no more , but that your daughter , ere she seems as won , desires this ring , appoints him an encounter , in fine , delivers me to fill the time , herself most chastely absent after this , to marry her , i add three thousand crowns to what is passed already .
i have yielded instruct my daughter how she shall persever , that time and place with this deceit so lawful may prove coherent .
every night he comes with musics of all sorts and songs composed to her unworthiness it nothing steads us to chide him from our eaves , for he persists as if his life lay o .
why then let us assay our plot , which , if it speed , is wicked meaning in a lawful deed and lawful meaning in a lawful act , where both not sin , and yet a sinful fact but let about it .
exeunt act iv scene i .
without the florentine camp .
enter second french lord , with five or six other soldiers in ambush he can come no other way but by this .
when you sally upon him , speak what terrible language you will though you understand it not yourselves , no matter , for we must not seem to understand him , unless some one among us whom we must produce for an interpreter .
good captain , let me be the interpreter .
art not acquainted with him ?
knows he not thy voice ?
no , sir , i warrant you .
but what hast thou to speak to us again ?
such as you speak to me .
he must think us some band of strangers i ' the adversary entertainment .
now he hath a smack of all neighbouring languages , therefore we must every one be a man of his own fancy , not to know what we speak one to another , so we seem to know , is to know straight our purpose choughs ' language , gabble enough , and good enough .
as for you , interpreter , you must seem very politic .
but couch , ho !
here he comes , to beguile two hours in a sleep , and then to return and swear the lies he forges .
enter parolles ten within these three hours be time enough to go home .
what shall i say i have done ?
it must be a very plausive invention that carries it they begin to smoke me , and disgraces have of late knocked too often at my door .
i find my tongue is too foolhardy , but my heart hath the fear of mars before it and of his creatures , not daring the reports of my tongue .
this is the first truth that thine own tongue was guilty of .
what the devil should move me to undertake the recovery of this drum , being not ignorant of the impossibility , and knowing i had no such purpose ?
i must give myself some hurts , and say i got them in exploit yet slight ones will not carry it , they will say , you off with so little ? '
and great ones i dare not give .
wherefore , what the instance ?
tongue , i must put you into a mouth and buy myself another of bajazet mule , if you prattle me into these perils .
is it possible he should know what he is , and be that he is ?
i would the cutting of my garments would serve the turn , or the breaking of my spanish sword .
we can not afford you so .
or the baring of my beard , and to say it was in stratagem .
not do .
or to drown my clothes , and say i was stripped .
hardly serve .
though i swore i leaped from the window of the citadel .
how deep ?
thirty fathom .
three great oaths would scarce make that be believed .
i would i had any drum of the enemy i would swear i recovered it .
you shall hear one anon .

exeunt scene ii .
florence .
the widow house .
enter bertram and diana they told me that your name was fontibell .
no , my good lord , diana .
titled goddess , and worth it , with addition !
but , fair soul , in your fine frame hath love no quality ?
if quick fire of youth light not your mind , you are no maiden , but a monument when you are dead , you should be such a one as you are now , for you are cold and stem , and now you should be as your mother was when your sweet self was got .
she then was honest .
so should you be .
no my mother did but duty , such , my lord , as you owe to your wife .
no more o ' that , i prithee , do not strive against my vows i was compell to her , but i love thee by love own sweet constraint , and will for ever do thee all rights of service .
ay , so you serve us till we serve you , but when you have our roses , you barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves and mock us with our bareness .
how have i sworn !
is not the many oaths that makes the truth , but the plain single vow that is vow true .
what is not holy , that we swear not by , but take the to witness then , pray you , tell me , if i should swear by god great attributes , i loved you dearly , would you believe my oaths , when i did love you ill ?
this has no holding , to swear by him whom i protest to love , that i will work against him therefore your oaths are words and poor conditions , but unseal , at least in my opinion .
change it , change it , be not so love is holy , and my integrity knew the crafts that you do charge men with .
stand no more off , but give thyself unto my sick desires , who then recover say thou art mine , and ever my love as it begins shall so persever .
i see that men make ropes in such a scarre that we forsake ourselves .
give me that ring .
i lend it thee , my dear , but have no power to give it from me .
will you not , my lord ?
it is an honour to our house , bequeathed down from many ancestors , which were the greatest obloquy i ' the world in me to lose .
mine honour such a ring my chastity the jewel of our house , bequeathed down from many ancestors , which were the greatest obloquy i ' the world in me to lose thus your own proper wisdom brings in the champion honour on my part , against your vain assault .
here , take my ring my house , mine honour , yea , my life , be thine , and i be bid by thee .
when midnight comes , knock at my i order take my mother shall not hear .
now will i charge you in the band of truth , when you have conquer my yet maiden bed , remain there but an hour , nor speak to me my reasons are most strong , and you shall know them when back again this ring shall be deliver and on your finger in the night i put another ring , that what in time proceeds may token to the future our past deeds .
adieu , till then , then , fail not .
you have won a wife of me , though there my hope be done .
a heaven on earth i have won by wooing thee .
exit for which live long to thank both heaven and me !
you may so in the end .
my mother told me just how he would woo , as if she sat in heart , she says all men have the like oaths he had sworn to marry me when his wife dead , therefore i lie with him when i am buried .
since frenchmen are so braid , marry that will , i live and die a maid only in this disguise i no sin to cozen him that would unjustly win .
exit scene iii .
the florentine camp .
enter the two french lords and some two or three soldiers you have not given him his mother letter ?
i have delivered it an hour since there is something i that stings his nature , for on the reading it he changed almost into another man .
he has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking off so good a wife and so sweet a lady .
especially he hath incurred the everlasting displeasure of the king , who had even tuned his bounty to sing happiness to him .
i will tell you a thing , but you shall let it dwell darkly with you .
when you have spoken it , is dead , and i am the grave of it .
he hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in florence , of a most chaste renown , and this night he fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour he hath given her his monumental ring , and thinks himself made in the unchaste composition .
now , god delay our rebellion !
as we are ourselves , what things are we !
merely our own traitors .
and as in the common course of all treasons , we still see them reveal themselves , till they attain to their abhorred ends , so he that in this action contrives against his own nobility , in his proper stream himself .
is it not meant damnable in us , to be trumpeters of our unlawful intents ?
we shall not then have his company ?
not till after midnight , for he is dieted to his hour .
that approaches apace , i would gladly have him see his company anatomized , that he might take a measure of his own judgments , wherein so curiously he had set this counterfeit .
we will not meddle with him till he come , for his presence must be the whip of the other .
in the mean time , what hear you of these wars ?
i hear there is an overture of peace .
nay , i assure you , a peace concluded .
what will count rousillon do then ?
will he travel higher , or return again into france ?
i perceive , by this demand , you are not altogether of his council .
let it be forbid , sir , so should i be a great deal of his act .
sir , his wife some two months since fled from his house her pretence is a pilgrimage to saint jaques le grand , which holy undertaking with most austere sanctimony she accomplished , and , there residing the tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her grief , in fine , made a groan of her last breath , and now she sings in heaven .
how is this justified ?
the stronger part of it by her own letters , which makes her story true , even to the point of her death her death itself , which could not be her office to say is come , was faithfully confirmed by the rector of the place .
hath the count all this intelligence ?
ay , and the particular confirmations , point from point , so to the full arming of the verity .
i am heartily sorry that he be glad of this .
how mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses !
and how mightily some other times we drown our gain in tears !
the great dignity that his valour hath here acquired for him shall at home be encountered with a shame as ample .
the web of our life is of a mingled yarn , good and ill together our virtues would be proud , if our faults whipped them not , and our crimes would despair , if they were not cherished by our virtues .
enter a messenger how now !
where your master ?
he met the duke in the street , sir , of whom he hath taken a solemn leave his lordship will next morning for france .
the duke hath offered him letters of commendations to the king .
they shall be no more than needful there , if they were more than they can commend .
they can not be too sweet for the king tartness .
here his lordship now .
enter bertram how now , my lord !
not after midnight ?
i have dispatched sixteen businesses , a month length , by an abstract of success i have congied with the duke , done my adieu with his nearest , buried a wife , mourned for her , writ to my lady mother i am returning , entertained my convoy , and between these main parcels of dispatch effected many nicer needs , the last was the greatest , but that i have not ended yet .
if the business be of any difficulty , and this morning your departure hence , it requires haste of your lordship .
i mean , the business is not ended , as fearing to hear of it hereafter .
but shall we have this dialogue between the fool and the soldier ?
come , bring forth this counterfeit module , he has deceived me , like a prophesier .
bring him forth has sat i ' the stocks all night , poor gallant knave .
no matter his heels have deserved it , in usurping his spurs so long .
how does he carry himself ?
i have told your lordship already , the stocks carry him .
but to answer you as you would be understood , he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk he hath confessed himself to morgan , whom he supposes to be a friar , from the time of his remembrance to this very instant disaster of his setting i ' the stocks and what think you he hath confessed ?
nothing of me , has a ' ?
his confession is taken , and it shall be read to his face if your lordship be i , as i believe you are , you must have the patience to hear it .
enter parolles guarded , and first soldier a plague upon him !
muffled !
he can say nothing of me hush , hush !
hoodman comes !
portotartarosa he calls for the tortures what will you say without ?
i will confess what i know without constraint if ye pinch me like a pasty , i can say no more .

you are a merciful general .
our general bids you answer to what i shall ask you out of a note .
and truly , as i hope to live .
reads demand of him how many horse the duke is strong . '
what say you to that ?
five or six thousand , but very weak and unserviceable the troops are all scattered , and the commanders very poor rogues , upon my reputation and credit and as i hope to live .
shall i set down your answer so ?
do i take the sacrament o , how and which way you will .
all one to him .
what a slave is this !
you deceived , my lord this is monsieur parolles , the gallant militarist , that was his own phrase , that had the whole theoric of war in the knot of his scarf , and the practise in the chape of his dagger .
i will never trust a man again for keeping his sword clean .
nor believe he can have every thing in him by wearing his apparel neatly .
well , that set down .
five or six thousand horse , i said , i will say true , or thereabouts , set down , for i speak truth .
he very near the truth in this .
but i con him no thanks , in the nature he delivers it .
poor rogues , i pray you , say .
well , that set down .
i humbly thank you , sir a truth a truth , the rogues are marvellous poor .
reads of him , of what strength they are . '
what say you to that ?
by my troth , sir , if i were to live this present hour , i will tell true .
let me see spurio , a hundred and fifty , sebastian , so many , corambus , so many , jaques , so many , guiltian , cosmo , lodowick , and gratii , two hundred and fifty each , mine own company , chitopher , vaumond , bentii , two hundred and fifty each so that the , rotten and sound , upon my life , amounts not to fifteen thousand poll , half of the which dare not shake snow from off their cassocks , lest they shake themselves to pieces .
what shall be done to him ?
nothing , but let him have thanks .
demand of him my condition , and what credit i have with the duke .
well , that set down .
reads shall demand of him , whether one captain dumain be i ' the camp , a frenchman , what his reputation is with the duke , what his valour , honesty , and expertness in wars , or whether he thinks it were not possible , with sums of gold , to corrupt him to revolt . '
what say you to this ?
what do you know of it ?
i beseech you , let me answer to the particular of the demand them singly .
do you know this captain dumain ?
i know him a ' was a botcher in paris , from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve fool with child , a dumb innocent , that could not say him nay .
nay , by your leave , hold your hands , though i know his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls .
well , is this captain in the duke of florence camp ?
upon my knowledge , he is , and lousy .
nay look not so upon me , we shall hear of your lordship anon .
what is his reputation with the duke ?
the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of mine , and writ to me this other day to turn him out o ' the band i think i have his letter in my pocket .
marry , we search .
in good sadness , i do not know , either it is there , or it is upon a file with the duke other letters in my tent .
here is , here a paper shall i read it to you ?
i do not know if it be it or no .
our interpreter does it well .
excellently .
reads , the count a fool , and full of gold , ' that is not the duke letter , sir , that is an advertisement to a proper maid in florence , one diana , to take heed of the allurement of one count rousillon , a foolish idle boy , but for all that very ruttish i pray you , sir , put it up again .
nay , i read it first , by your favour .
my meaning i , i protest , was very honest in the behalf of the maid , for i knew the young count to be a dangerous and lascivious boy , who is a whale to virginity and devours up all the fry it finds .
damnable rogue !
reads he swears oaths , bid him drop gold , and take it , after he scores , he never pays the score half won is match well made , match , and well make it , he pays , take it before , and say a soldier , dian , told thee this , men are to mell with , boys are not to kiss for count of this , the count a fool , i know it , who pays before , but not when he does owe it .
thine , as he vowed to thee in thine ear , parolles . '
he shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme in forehead .
this is your devoted friend , sir , the manifold linguist and the armipotent soldier .
i could endure any thing before but a cat , and now he a cat to me .
i perceive , sir , by the general looks , we shall be fain to hang you .
my life , sir , in any case not that i am afraid to die , but that , my offences being many , i would repent out the remainder of nature let me live , sir , in a dungeon , i ' the stocks , or any where , so i may live .
we see what may be done , so you confess freely , therefore , once more to this captain dumain you have answered to his reputation with the duke and to his valour what is his honesty ?
he will steal , sir , an egg out of a cloister for rapes and ravishments he parallels nessus he professes not keeping of oaths , in breaking he is stronger than hercules he will lie , sir , with such volubility , that you would think truth were a fool drunkenness is his best virtue , for he will be , and in his sleep he does little harm , save to his about him , but they know his conditions and lay him in straw .
i have but little more to say , sir , of his honesty he has every thing that an honest man should not have , what an honest man should have , he has nothing .
i begin to love him for this .
for this description of thine honesty ?
a pox upon him for me , he more and more a cat .
what say you to his expertness in war ?
faith , sir , he has led the drum before the english tragedians , to belie him , i will not , and more of his soldiership i know not , except , in that country he had the honour to be the officer at a place there called , to instruct for the doubling of files i would do the man what honour i can , but of this i am not certain .
he hath villany so far , that the rarity redeems him .
a pox on him , he a cat still .
his qualities being at this poor price , i need not to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt .
sir , for a quart he will sell the of his salvation , the inheritance of it , and cut the entail from all remainders , and a perpetual succession for it perpetually .
what his brother , the other captain dumain ?
why does be ask him of me ?
what he ?
a crow o ' the same nest , not altogether so great as the first in goodness , but greater a great deal in evil he excels his brother for a coward , yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is in a retreat he outruns any lackey , marry , in coming on he has the cramp .
if your life be saved , will you undertake to betray the florentine ?
ay , and the captain of his horse , count rousillon .
i whisper with the general , and know his pleasure .
aside i no more drumming , a plague of all drums !
only to seem to deserve well , and to beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy the count , have i run into this danger .
yet who would have suspected an ambush where i was taken ?
there is no remedy , sir , but you must die the general says , you that have so traitorously discovered the secrets of your army and made such pestiferous reports of men very nobly held , can serve the world for no honest use , therefore you must die .
come , headsman , off with his head .
o lord , sir , let me live , or let me see my death !
that shall you , and take your leave of all your friends .
unblinding him so , look about you know you any here ?
good morrow , noble captain .
god bless you , captain parolles .
god save you , noble captain .
captain , what greeting will you to my lord lafeu ?
i am for france .
good captain , will you give me a copy of the sonnet you writ to diana in behalf of the count rousillon ?
an i were not a very coward , compel it of you but fare you well .
exeunt bertram and lords you are undone , captain , all but your scarf , that has a knot o yet who can not be crushed with a plot ?
if you could find out a country where but women were that had received so much shame , you might begin an impudent nation .
fare ye well , sir , i am for france too we shall speak of you there .
exit with soldiers yet am i thankful if my heart were great , burst at this .
captain i be no more , but i will eat and drink , and sleep as soft as captain shall simply the thing i am shall make me live .
who knows himself a braggart , let him fear this , for it will come to pass that every braggart shall be found an ass .

i would i had not known him , it was the death of the most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had praise for creating .
if she had partaken of my flesh , and cost me the dearest groans of a mother , i could not have owed her a more rooted love .
was a good lady , was a good lady we may pick a thousand salads ere we light on such another herb .

they are not herbs , you knave , they are .
i am no great nebuchadnezzar , sir , i have not much skill in grass .
whether dost thou profess thyself , a knave or a fool ?
a fool , sir , at a woman service , and a knave at a man .
your distinction ?
i would cozen the man of his wife and do his service .
so you were a knave at his service , indeed .
and i would give his wife my bauble , sir , to do her service .
i will subscribe for thee , thou art both knave and fool .

what prince is that ?
the black prince , sir , alias , the prince of darkness , alias , the devil .
hold thee , there my purse i give thee not this to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of , serve him still .
i am a woodland fellow , sir , that always loved a great fire , and the master i speak of ever keeps a good fire .
but , sure , he is the prince of the world , let his nobility remain in court .
i am for the house with the narrow gate , which i take to be too little for pomp to enter some that humble themselves may , but the many will be too chill and tender , and they be for the flowery way that leads to the broad gate and the great fire .
go thy ways , i begin to be aweary of thee , and i tell thee so before , because i would not fall out with thee .

how does your ladyship like it ?
with very much content , my lord , and i wish it happily effected .
his highness comes post from marseilles , of as able body as when he numbered thirty he will be here , or i am deceived by him that in such intelligence hath seldom failed .
it rejoices me , that i hope i shall see him ere i die .
i have letters that my son will be here i shall beseech your lordship to remain with me till they meet together .
madam , i was thinking with what manners i might safely be admitted .
you need but plead your honourable privilege .
lady , of that i have made a bold charter , but i thank my god it holds yet .

exit my lord , i am a man whom fortune hath cruelly scratched .

the count palace .
flourish .
enter king , countess , lafeu , the two french lords , with attendants we lost a jewel of her , and our esteem was made much poorer by it but your son , as mad in folly , lack the sense to know her estimation home .
is past , my liege , and i beseech your majesty to make it natural rebellion , done i ' the blaze of youth , when oil and fire , too strong for reason force , it and burns on .
my honour lady , i have forgiven and forgotten all , though my revenges were high bent upon him , and watch the time to shoot .
this i must say , but first i beg my pardon , the young lord did to his majesty , his mother and his lady offence of mighty note , but to himself the greatest wrong of all .
he lost a wife whose beauty did astonish the survey of richest eyes , whose words all ears took captive , whose dear perfection hearts that scorn to serve humbly call mistress .
praising what is lost makes the remembrance dear .
well , call him hither , we are reconciled , and the first view shall kill all repetition let him not ask our pardon , the nature of his great offence is dead , and deeper than oblivion we do bury the incensing relics of it let him approach , a stranger , no offender , and inform him so is our will he should .
i shall , my liege .
exit what says he to your daughter ?
have you spoke ?
all that he is hath reference to your highness .
then shall we have a match .
i have letters sent me that set him high in fame .
enter bertram he looks well o .
i am not a day of season , for thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail in me at once but to the brightest beams distracted clouds give way , so stand thou forth , the time is fair again .
my blames , dear sovereign , pardon to me .
all is whole , not one word more of the consumed time .
let take the instant by the forward top , for we are old , and on our decrees the inaudible and noiseless foot of time steals ere we can effect them .
you remember the daughter of this lord ?
admiringly , my liege , at first i stuck my choice upon her , ere my heart durst make too bold a herald of my tongue where the impression of mine eye infixing , contempt his scornful perspective did lend me , which warp the line of every other favour , scorn a fair colour , or express it stolen , extended or contracted all proportions to a most hideous object thence it came that she whom all men praised and whom myself , since i have lost , have loved , was in mine eye the dust that did offend it .
well excused that thou didst love her , strikes some scores away from the great compt but love that comes too late , like a remorseful pardon slowly carried , to the great sender turns a sour offence , crying , good that gone . '
our rash faults make trivial price of serious things we have , not knowing them until we know their grave oft our displeasures , to ourselves unjust , destroy our friends and after weep their dust our own love waking cries to see what done , while shame full late sleeps out the afternoon .
be this sweet helen knell , and now forget her .
send forth your amorous token for fair maudlin the main consents are had , and here we stay to see our widower second .
which better than the first , o dear heaven , bless !
or , ere they meet , in me , o nature , cesse !
come on , my son , in whom my house name must be digested , give a favour from you to sparkle in the spirits of my daughter , that she may quickly come .
bertram gives a ring by my old beard , and every hair that o , helen , that dead , was a sweet creature such a ring as this , the last that i took her at court , i saw upon her finger .
hers it was not .
now , pray you , let me see it , for mine eye , while i was speaking , oft was fasten .
this ring was mine , and , when i gave it helen , i bade her , if her fortunes ever stood necessitied to help , that by this token i would relieve her .
had you that craft , to reave her of what should stead her most ?
my gracious sovereign , it pleases you to take it so , the ring was never hers .
son , on my life , i have seen her wear it , and she reckon it at her life rate .
i am sure i saw her wear it .
you are deceived , my lord , she never saw it in florence was it from a casement thrown me , wrapp in a paper , which contain the name of her that threw it noble she was , and thought i stood engaged but when i had subscribed to mine own fortune and inform her fully i could not answer in that course of honour as she had made the overture , she ceased in heavy satisfaction and would never receive the ring again .
plutus himself , that knows the tinct and multiplying medicine , hath not in nature mystery more science than i have in this ring was mine , was helen , whoever gave it you .
then , if you know that you are well acquainted with yourself , confess was hers , and by what rough enforcement you got it from her she call the saints to surety that she would never put it from her finger , unless she gave it to yourself in bed , where you have never come , or sent it us upon her great disaster .
she never saw it .
thou it falsely , as i love mine honour , and makest conjectural fears to come into me which i would fain shut out .
if it should prove that thou art so inhuman , not prove so , and yet i know not thou didst hate her deadly , and she is dead , which nothing , but to close her eyes myself , could win me to believe , more than to see this ring .
take him away .
guards seize bertram my proofs , the matter fall , shall tax my fears of little vanity , having vainly fear too little .
away with him !
we sift this matter further .
if you shall prove this ring was ever hers , you shall as easy prove that i husbanded her bed in florence , where yet she never was .
exit , guarded i am wrapp in dismal thinkings .
enter a gentleman gracious sovereign , whether i have been to blame or no , i know not here a petition from a florentine , who hath for four or five removes come short to tender it herself .
i undertook it , vanquish thereto by the fair grace and speech of the poor suppliant , who by this i know is here attending her business looks in her with an importing visage , and she told me , in a sweet verbal brief , it did concern your highness with herself .
reads upon his many protestations to marry me when his wife was dead , i blush to say it , he won me .
now is the count rousillon a widower his vows are forfeited to me , and my honour paid to him .
he stole from florence , taking no leave , and i follow him to his country for justice grant it me , o king !
in you it best lies , otherwise a seducer flourishes , and a poor maid is undone .
diana capilet .
i will buy me a in a fair , and toll for this i none of him .
the heavens have thought well on thee lafeu , to bring forth this discovery .
seek these suitors go speedily and bring again the count .
i am afeard the life of helen , lady , was foully snatch .
now , justice on the doers !
bertram , guarded i wonder , sir , sith wives are monsters to you , and that you fly them as you swear them lordship , yet you desire to marry .
enter widow and diana what woman that ?
i am , my lord , a wretched florentine , derived from the ancient capilet my suit , as i do understand , you know , and therefore know how far i may be pitied .
i am her mother , sir , whose age and honour both suffer under this complaint we bring , and both shall cease , without your remedy .
come hither , count , do you know these women ?
my lord , i neither can nor will deny but that i know them do they charge me further ?
why do you look so strange upon your wife ?
she none of mine , my lord .
if you shall marry , you give away this hand , and that is mine , you give away heaven vows , and those are mine , you give away myself , which is known mine , for i by vow am so embodied yours , that she which marries you must marry me , either both or none .
your reputation comes too short for my daughter , you are no husband for her .
my lord , this is a fond and desperate creature , whom sometime i have laugh with let your highness lay a more noble thought upon mine honour than for to think that i would sink it here .
sir , for my thoughts , you have them ill to friend till your deeds gain them fairer prove your honour than in my thought it lies .
good my lord , ask him upon his oath , if he does think he had not my virginity .
what thou to her ?
she impudent , my lord , and was a common gamester to the camp .
he does me wrong , my lord , if i were so , he might have bought me at a common price do not believe him .
o , behold this ring , whose high respect and rich validity did lack a parallel , yet for all that he gave it to a commoner o ' the camp , if i be one .
he blushes , and is it of six preceding ancestors , that gem , conferr by testament to the sequent issue , hath it been owed and worn .
this is his wife , that ring a thousand proofs .
methought you said you saw one here in court could witness it .
i did , my lord , but loath am to produce so bad an instrument his name parolles .
i saw the man , if man he be .
find him , and bring him hither .
exit an attendant what of him ?
he quoted for a most perfidious slave , with all the spots o ' the world tax and debosh , whose nature sickens but to speak a truth .
am i or that or this for what he utter , that will speak any thing ?
she hath that ring of yours .
i think she has certain it is i liked her , and boarded her i ' the wanton way of youth she knew her distance and did angle for me , madding my eagerness with her restraint , as all impediments in fancy course are motives of more fancy , and , in fine , her infinite cunning , with her modern grace , subdued me to her rate she got the ring , and i had that which any inferior might at have bought .
i must be patient you , that have turn off a first so noble wife , may justly diet me .
i pray you yet , since you lack virtue , i will lose a husband , send for your ring , i will return it home , and give me mine again .
i have it not .
what ring was yours , i pray you ?
sir , much like the same upon your finger .
know you this ring ?
this ring was his of late .
and this was it i gave him , being abed .
the story then goes false , you threw it him out of a casement .
i have spoke the truth .
enter parolles my lord , i do confess the ring was hers .
you boggle shrewdly , every feather stars you .
is this the man you speak of ?
ay , my lord .
tell me , sirrah , but tell me true , i charge you , not fearing the displeasure of your master , which on your just proceeding i keep off , by him and by this woman here what know you ?
so please your majesty , my master hath been an honourable gentleman tricks he hath had in him , which gentlemen have .
come , come , to the purpose did he love this woman ?
faith , sir , he did love her , but how ?
how , i pray you ?
he did love her , sir , as a gentleman loves a woman .
how is that ?
he loved her , sir , and loved her not .
as thou art a knave , and no knave .
what an equivocal companion is this !
i am a poor man , and at your majesty command .
he a good drum , my lord , but a naughty orator .
do you know he promised me marriage ?
faith , i know more than i speak .
but wilt thou not speak all thou knowest ?
yes , so please your majesty .
i did go between them , as i said , but more than that , he loved her for indeed he was mad for her , and talked of satan and of limbo and of furies and i know not what yet i was in that credit with them at that time that i knew of their going to bed , and of other motions , as promising her marriage , and things which would derive me ill will to speak of , therefore i will not speak what i know .
thou hast spoken all already , unless thou canst say they are married but thou art too fine in thy evidence , therefore stand aside .
this ring , you say , was yours ?
ay , my good lord .
where did you buy it ?
or who gave it you ?
it was not given me , nor i did not buy it .
who lent it you ?
it was not lent me neither .
where did you find it , then ?
i found it not .
if it were yours by none of all these ways , how could you give it him ?
i never gave it him .
this woman an easy glove , my lord , she goes off and on at pleasure .
this ring was mine , i gave it his first wife .
it might be yours or hers , for aught i know .
take her away , i do not like her now , to prison with her and away with him .
unless thou me where thou hadst this ring , thou diest within this hour .
i never tell you .
take her away .
i put in bail , my liege .
i think thee now some common customer .
by jove , if ever i knew man , was you .
wherefore hast thou accused him all this while ?
because he guilty , and he is not guilty he knows i am no maid , and he swear , i swear i am a maid , and he knows not .
great king , i am no strumpet , by my life , i am either maid , or else this old man wife .
she does abuse our ears to prison with her .
good mother , fetch my bail .
stay , royal sir exit widow the jeweller that owes the ring is sent for , and he shall surety me .
but for this lord , who hath abused me , as he knows himself , though yet he never harm me , here i quit him he knows himself my bed he hath defiled , and at that time he got his wife with child dead though she be , she feels her young one kick so there my riddle one that dead is quick and now behold the meaning .
widow , with helena is there no exorcist beguiles the truer office of mine eyes ?
real that i see ?
no , my good lord , is but the shadow of a wife you see , the name and not the thing .
both , both .
o , pardon !
o my good lord , when i was like this maid , i found you wondrous kind .
there is your ring , and , look you , here your letter , this it says from my finger you can get this ring and are by me with child , ' and this is done will you be mine , now you are doubly won ?
if she , my liege , can make me know this clearly , i love her dearly , ever , ever dearly .
if it appear not plain and prove untrue , deadly divorce step between me and you !

exeunt act i scene orchard of oliver house .
enter orlando and adam as i remember , adam , it was upon this fashion bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns , and , as thou sayest , charged my brother , on his blessing , to breed me well and there begins my sadness .
my brother jaques he keeps at school , and report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part , he keeps me rustically at home , or , to speak more properly , stays me here at home unkept , for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth , that differs not from the stalling of an ox ?
his horses are bred better , for , besides that they are fair with their feeding , they are taught their manage , and to that end riders dearly hired but i , his brother , gain nothing under him but growth , for the which his animals on his dunghills are as much bound to him as i .
besides this nothing that he so plentifully gives me , the something that nature gave me his countenance seems to take from me he lets me feed with his hinds , bars me the place of a brother , and , as much as in him lies , mines my gentility with my education .
this is it , adam , that grieves me , and the spirit of my father , which i think is within me , begins to mutiny against this servitude i will no longer endure it , though yet i know no wise remedy how to avoid it .
yonder comes my master , your brother .
go apart , adam , and thou shalt hear how he will shake me up .
enter oliver now , sir !
what make you here ?
nothing i am not taught to make any thing .
what mar you then , sir ?
marry , sir , i am helping you to mar that which god made , a poor unworthy brother of yours , with idleness .
marry , sir , be better employed , and be naught awhile .
shall i keep your hogs and eat husks with them ?
what prodigal portion have i spent , that i should come to such penury ?
know you where your are , sir ?
o , sir , very well , here in your orchard .
know you before whom , sir ?
ay , better than him i am before knows me .
i know you are my eldest brother , and , in the gentle condition of blood , you should so know me .
the courtesy of nations allows you my better , in that you are the , but the same tradition takes not away my blood , were there twenty brothers betwixt us i have as much of my father in me as you , albeit , i confess , your coming before me is nearer to his reverence .
what , boy !
come , come , elder brother , you are too young in this .
wilt thou lay hands on me , villain ?
i am no villain , i am the youngest son of sir rowland de boys , he was my father , and he is thrice a villain that says such a father begot villains .
wert thou not my brother , i would not take this hand from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself .
sweet masters , be patient for your father remembrance , be at accord .
let me go , i say .
i will not , till i please you shall hear me .
my father charged you in his will to give me good education you have trained me like a peasant , obscuring and hiding from me all qualities .
the spirit of my father grows strong in me , and i will no longer endure it therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman , or give me the poor allottery my father left me by testament , with that i will go buy my fortunes .
and what wilt thou do ?
beg , when that is spent ?
well , sir , get you in i will not long be troubled with you , you shall have some part of your will i pray you , leave me .
i will no further offend you than becomes me for my good .
get you with him , you old dog .
is dog ' my reward ?
most true , i have lost my teeth in your service .
god be with my old master !
he would not have spoke such a word .
exeunt orlando and adam is it even so ?
begin you to grow upon me ?
i will physic your rankness , and yet give no thousand crowns neither .
holla , dennis !
enter dennis calls your worship ?
was not charles , the duke wrestler , here to speak with me ?
so please you , he is here at the door and importunes access to you .
call him in .
exit dennis be a good way , and the wrestling is .
enter charles good morrow to your worship .
good monsieur charles , what the new news at the new court ?
there no news at the court , sir , but the old news that is , the old duke is banished by his younger brother the new duke , and three or four loving lords have put themselves into voluntary exile with him , whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke , therefore he gives them good leave to wander .
can you tell if rosalind , the duke daughter , be banished with her father ?
o , no , for the duke daughter , her cousin , so loves her , being ever from their cradles bred together , that she would have followed her exile , or have died to stay behind her .
she is at the court , and no less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter , and never two ladies loved as they do .
where will the old duke live ?
they say he is already in the forest of arden , and a many merry men with him , and there they live like the old robin hood of england they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day , and fleet the time carelessly , as they did in the golden world .
what , you wrestle before the new duke ?
marry , do i , sir , and i came to acquaint you with a matter .
i am given , sir , secretly to understand that your younger brother orlando hath a disposition to come in disguised against me to try a fall .
, sir , i wrestle for my credit , and he that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well .
your brother is but young and tender , and , for your love , i would be loath to foil him , as i must , for my own honour , if he come in therefore , out of my love to you , i came hither to acquaint you withal , that either you might stay him from his intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall run into , in that it is a thing of his own search and altogether against my will .
charles , i thank thee for thy love to me , which thou shalt find i will most kindly requite .
i had myself notice of my brother purpose herein and have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from it , but he is resolute .
i tell thee , charles it is the stubbornest young fellow of france , full of ambition , an envious emulator of every man good parts , a secret and villanous contriver against me his natural brother therefore use thy discretion , i had as lief thou didst break his neck as his finger .
and thou wert best look , for if thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not mightily grace himself on thee , he will practise against thee by poison , entrap thee by some treacherous device and never leave thee till he hath thy life by some indirect means or other , for , i assure thee , and almost with tears i speak it , there is not one so young and so villanous this day living .
i speak but brotherly of him , but should i anatomize him to thee as he is , i must blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder .
i am heartily glad i came hither to you .
if he come , i give him his payment if ever he go alone again , i never wrestle for prize more and so god keep your worship !
farewell , good charles .
exit charles now will i stir this gamester i hope i shall see an end of him , for my soul , yet i know not why , hates nothing more than he .
yet he gentle , never schooled and yet learned , full of noble device , of all sorts enchantingly beloved , and indeed so much in the heart of the world , and especially of my own people , who best know him , that i am altogether misprised but it shall not be so long , this wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that i kindle the boy thither , which now i go about .
exit scene ii .
lawn before the duke palace .
enter celia and rosalind i pray thee , rosalind , sweet my coz , be merry .
dear celia , i show more mirth than i am mistress of , and would you yet i were merrier ?
unless you could teach me to forget a banished father , you must not learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure .
herein i see thou lovest me not with the full weight that i love thee .
if my uncle , thy banished father , had banished thy uncle , the duke my father , so thou hadst been still with me , i could have taught my love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou , if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously tempered as mine is to thee .
well , i will forget the condition of my estate , to rejoice in yours .
you know my father hath no child but i , nor none is like to have and , truly , when he dies , thou shalt be his heir , for what he hath taken away from thy father perforce , i will render thee again in affection , by mine honour , i will , and when i break that oath , let me turn monster therefore , my sweet rose , my dear rose , be merry .
from henceforth i will , coz , and devise sports .
let me see , what think you of falling in love ?
marry , i prithee , do , to make sport withal but love no man in good earnest , nor no further in sport neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst in honour come off again .
what shall be our sport , then ?
let us sit and mock the good housewife fortune from her wheel , that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally .
i would we could do so , for her benefits are mightily misplaced , and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women .
is true , for those that she makes fair she scarce makes honest , and those that she makes honest she makes very .
nay , now thou goest from fortune office to nature fortune reigns in gifts of the world , not in the lineaments of nature .
enter touchstone no ?
when nature hath made a fair creature , may she not by fortune fall into the fire ?
though nature hath given us wit to flout at fortune , hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument ?
indeed , there is fortune too hard for nature , when fortune makes nature natural the of nature wit .
peradventure this is not fortune work neither , but nature , who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this natural for our whetstone , for always the dulness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits .
how now , wit !
whither wander you ?
mistress , you must come away to your father .
were you made the messenger ?
no , by mine honour , but i was bid to come for you .
where learned you that oath , fool ?
of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were good pancakes and swore by his honour the mustard was naught now i stand to it , the pancakes were naught and the mustard was good , and yet was not the knight forsworn .
how prove you that , in the great heap of your knowledge ?
ay , marry , now unmuzzle your wisdom .
stand you both forth now stroke your chins , and swear by your beards that i am a knave .
by our beards , if we had them , thou art .
by my knavery , if i had it , then i were , but if you swear by that that is not , you are not forsworn no more was this knight swearing by his honour , for he never had any , or if he had , he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard .
prithee , who that thou meanest ?
one that old frederick , your father , loves .
my father love is enough to honour him enough !
speak no more of him , you be whipped for taxation one of these days .
the more pity , that fools may not speak wisely what wise men do foolishly .
by my troth , thou sayest true , for since the little wit that fools have was silenced , the little foolery that wise men have makes a great show .
here comes monsieur le beau .
with his mouth full of news .
which he will put on us , as pigeons feed their young .
then shall we be .
all the better , we shall be the more marketable .
enter le beau bon jour , monsieur le beau what the news ?
fair princess , you have lost much good sport .
sport !
of what colour ?
what colour , madam !
how shall i answer you ?
as wit and fortune will .
or as the destinies decree .
well said that was laid on with a trowel .
nay , if i keep not my rank , thou losest thy old smell .
you amaze me , ladies i would have told you of good wrestling , which you have lost the sight of .
you tell us the manner of the wrestling .
i will tell you the beginning , and , if it please your ladyships , you may see the end , for the best is yet to do , and here , where you are , they are coming to perform it .
well , the beginning , that is dead and buried .
there comes an old man and his three sons , i could match this beginning with an old tale .
three proper young men , of excellent growth and presence .
with bills on their necks , it known unto all men by these presents . '
the eldest of the three wrestled with charles , the duke wrestler , which charles in a moment threw him and broke three of his ribs , that there is little hope of life in him so he served the second , and so the third .
yonder they lie , the poor old man , their father , making such pitiful dole over them that all the beholders take his part with weeping .
alas !
but what is the sport , monsieur , that the ladies have lost ?
why , this that i speak of .
thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first time that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies .
or i , i promise thee .
but is there any else longs to see this broken music in his sides ?
is there yet another dotes upon ?
shall we see this wrestling , cousin ?
you must , if you stay here , for here is the place appointed for the wrestling , and they are ready to perform it .
yonder , sure , they are coming let us now stay and see it .
flourish .
enter duke frederick , lords , orlando , charles , and attendants come on since the youth will not be entreated , his own peril on his forwardness .
is yonder the man ?
even he , madam .
alas , he is too young !
yet he looks successfully .
how now , daughter and cousin !
are you crept hither to see the wrestling ?
ay , my liege , so please you give us leave .
you will take little delight in it , i can tell you , there is such odds in the man .
in pity of the challenger youth i would fain dissuade him , but he will not be entreated .
speak to him , ladies , see if you can move him .
call him hither , good monsieur le beau .
do so i not be by .
monsieur the challenger , the princesses call for you .
i attend them with all respect and duty .
young man , have you challenged charles the wrestler ?
no , fair princess , he is the general challenger i come but in , as others do , to try with him the strength of my youth .
young gentleman , your spirits are too bold for your years .
you have seen cruel proof of this man strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or knew yourself with your judgment , the fear of your adventure would counsel you to a more equal enterprise .
we pray you , for your own sake , to embrace your own safety and give over this attempt .
do , young sir , your reputation shall not therefore be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke that the wrestling might not go forward .
i beseech you , punish me not with your hard thoughts , wherein i confess me much guilty , to deny so fair and excellent ladies any thing .
but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my trial wherein if i be foiled , there is but one shamed that was never gracious , if killed , but one dead that was willing to be so i shall do my friends no wrong , for i have none to lament me , the world no injury , for in it i have nothing , only in the world i fill up a place , which may be better supplied when i have made it empty .
the little strength that i have , i would it were with you .
and mine , to eke out hers .
fare you well pray heaven i be deceived in you !
your heart desires be with you !
come , where is this young gallant that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth ?
ready , sir , but his will hath in it a more modest working .
you shall try but one fall .
no , i warrant your grace , you shall not entreat him to a second , that have so mightily persuaded him from a first .
an you mean to mock me after , you should not have mocked me before but come your ways .
now hercules be thy speed , young man !
i would i were invisible , to catch the strong fellow by the leg .
they wrestle o excellent young man !
if i had a thunderbolt in mine eye , i can tell who should down .
shout .
charles is thrown no more , no more .
yes , i beseech your grace i am not yet well breathed .
how dost thou , charles ?
he can not speak , my lord .
bear him away .
what is thy name , young man ?
orlando , my liege , the youngest son of sir rowland de boys .
i would thou hadst been son to some man else the world esteem thy father honourable , but i did find him still mine enemy thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed , hadst thou descended from another house .
but fare thee well , thou art a gallant youth i would thou hadst told me of another father .
exeunt duke frederick , train , and le beau were i my father , coz , would i do this ?
i am more proud to be sir rowland son , his youngest son , and would not change that calling , to be adopted heir to frederick .
my father loved sir rowland as his soul , and all the world was of my father mind had i before known this young man his son , i should have given him tears unto entreaties , ere he should thus have ventured .
gentle cousin , let us go thank him and encourage him my father rough and envious disposition sticks me at heart .
sir , you have well deserved if you do keep your promises in love but justly , as you have exceeded all promise , your mistress shall be happy .
gentleman , giving him a chain from her neck wear this for me , one out of suits with fortune , that could give more , but that her hand lacks means .
shall we go , coz ?
ay .
fare you well , fair gentleman .
can i not say , i thank you ?
my better parts are all thrown down , and that which here stands up is but a quintain , a mere lifeless block .
he calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes , i ask him what he would .
did you call , sir ?
sir , you have wrestled well and overthrown more than your enemies .
will you go , coz ?
have with you .
fare you well .
exeunt rosalind and celia what passion hangs these weights upon my tongue ?
i can not speak to her , yet she urged conference .
o poor orlando , thou art overthrown !
or charles or something weaker masters thee .
le beau good sir , i do in friendship counsel you to leave this place .
albeit you have deserved high commendation , true applause and love , yet such is now the duke condition that he misconstrues all that you have done .
the duke is humorous , what he is indeed , more suits you to conceive than i to speak of .
i thank you , sir and , pray you , tell me this which of the two was daughter of the duke that here was at the wrestling ?
neither his daughter , if we judge by manners , but yet indeed the lesser is his daughter the other is daughter to the banish duke , and here detain by her usurping uncle , to keep his daughter company , whose loves are dearer than the natural bond of sisters .
but i can tell you that of late this duke hath displeasure his gentle niece , grounded upon no other argument but that the people praise her for her virtues and pity her for her good father sake , and , on my life , his malice the lady will suddenly break forth .
sir , fare you well hereafter , in a better world than this , i shall desire more love and knowledge of you .
i rest much bounden to you fare you well .
exit le beau thus must i from the smoke into the smother , from tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother but heavenly rosalind !
exit scene iii .
a room in the palace .
enter celia and rosalind why , cousin !
why , rosalind !
cupid have mercy !
not a word ?
not one to throw at a dog .
no , thy words are too precious to be cast away upon curs , throw some of them at me , come , lame me with reasons .
then there were two cousins laid up , when the one should be lamed with reasons and the other mad without any .
but is all this for your father ?
no , some of it is for my child father .
o , how full of briers is this world !
they are but burs , cousin , thrown upon thee in holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden paths our very petticoats will catch them .
i could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart .
hem them away .
i would try , if i could cry ' and have him .
come , come , wrestle with thy affections .
o , they take the part of a better wrestler than myself !
o , a good wish upon you !
you will try in time , in despite of a fall .
but , turning these jests out of service , let us talk in good earnest is it possible , on such a sudden , you should fall into so strong a liking with old sir rowland youngest son ?
the duke my father loved his father dearly .
doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly ?
by this kind of chase , i should hate him , for my father hated his father dearly , yet i hate not orlando .
no , faith , hate him not , for my sake .
why should i not ?
doth he not deserve well ?
let me love him for that , and do you love him because i do .
look , here comes the duke .
with his eyes full of anger .
enter duke frederick , with lords mistress , dispatch you with your safest haste and get you from our court .
me , uncle ?
you , cousin within these ten days if that thou found so near our public court as twenty miles , thou diest for it .
i do beseech your grace , let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me if with myself i hold intelligence or have acquaintance with mine own desires , if that i do not dream or be not frantic , as i do trust i am not then , dear uncle , never so much as in a thought unborn did i offend your highness .
thus do all traitors if their purgation did consist in words , they are as innocent as grace itself let it suffice thee that i trust thee not .
yet your mistrust can not make me a traitor tell me whereon the likelihood depends .
thou art thy father daughter , there enough .
so was i when your highness took his dukedom , so was i when your highness banish him treason is not inherited , my lord , or , if we did derive it from our friends , what that to me ?
my father was no traitor then , good my liege , mistake me not so much to think my poverty is treacherous .
dear sovereign , hear me speak .
ay , celia , we stay her for your sake , else had she with her father ranged along .
i did not then entreat to have her stay , it was your pleasure and your own remorse i was too young that time to value her , but now i know her if she be a traitor , why so am i , we still have slept together , rose at an instant , learn , play , eat together , and wheresoever we went , like juno swans , still we went coupled and inseparable .
she is too subtle for thee , and her smoothness , her very silence and her patience speak to the people , and they pity her .
thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name , and thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous when she is gone .
then open not thy lips firm and irrevocable is my doom which i have pass upon her , she is banish .
pronounce that sentence then on me , my liege i can not live out of her company .
you are a fool .
you , niece , provide yourself if you outstay the time , upon mine honour , and in the greatness of my word , you die .
exeunt duke frederick and lords o my poor rosalind , whither wilt thou go ?
wilt thou change fathers ?
i will give thee mine .
i charge thee , be not thou more grieved than i am .
i have more cause .
thou hast not , cousin , prithee be cheerful thou not , the duke hath banish me , his daughter ?
that he hath not .
no , hath not ?
rosalind lacks then the love which teacheth thee that thou and i am one shall we be sunder ?
shall we part , sweet girl ?
no let my father seek another heir .
therefore devise with me how we may fly , whither to go and what to bear with us , and do not seek to take your change upon you , to bear your griefs yourself and leave me out , for , by this heaven , now at our sorrows pale , say what thou canst , i go along with thee .
why , whither shall we go ?
to seek my uncle in the forest of arden .
alas , what danger will it be to us , maids as we are , to travel forth so far !
beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold .
i put myself in poor and mean attire and with a kind of umber smirch my face , the like do you so shall we pass along and never stir assailants .
were it not better , because that i am more than common tall , that i did suit me all points like a man ?
a gallant upon my thigh , a in my hand , and in my heart lie there what hidden woman fear there will we have a swashing and a martial outside , as many other mannish cowards have that do outface it with their semblances .
what shall i call thee when thou art a man ?
i have no worse a name than jove own page , and therefore look you call me ganymede .
but what will you be call ?
something that hath a reference to my state no longer celia , but aliena .
but , cousin , what if we assay to steal the clownish fool out of your father court ?
would he not be a comfort to our travel ?
he go along the wide world with me , leave me alone to woo him .
let away , and get our jewels and our wealth together , devise the fittest time and safest way to hide us from pursuit that will be made after my flight .
now go we in content to liberty and not to banishment .
exeunt act ii scene i .
the forest of arden .
enter duke senior , amiens , and two or three lords , like foresters now , my and brothers in exile , hath not old custom made this life more sweet than that of painted pomp ?
are not these woods more free from peril than the envious court ?
here feel we but the penalty of adam , the seasons ' difference , as the icy fang and churlish chiding of the winter wind , which , when it bites and blows upon my body , even till i shrink with cold , i smile and say is no flattery these are counsellors that feelingly persuade me what i am . '
sweet are the uses of adversity , which , like the toad , ugly and venomous , wears yet a precious jewel in his head , and this our life exempt from public haunt finds tongues in trees , books in the running brooks , sermons in stones and good in every thing .
i would not change it .
happy is your grace , that can translate the stubbornness of fortune into so quiet and so sweet a style .
come , shall we go and kill us venison ?
and yet it irks me the poor dappled fools , being native burghers of this desert city , should in their own confines with forked heads have their round haunches gored .
indeed , my lord , the melancholy jaques grieves at that , and , in that kind , swears you do more usurp than doth your brother that hath banish you .
my lord of amiens and myself did steal behind him as he lay along under an oak whose antique root peeps out upon the brook that brawls along this wood to the which place a poor sequester stag , that from the hunter aim had a hurt , did come to languish , and indeed , my lord , the wretched animal heaved forth such groans that their discharge did stretch his leathern coat almost to bursting , and the big round tears coursed one another down his innocent nose in piteous chase , and thus the hairy fool much marked of the melancholy jaques , stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook , augmenting it with tears .
but what said jaques ?
did he not moralize this spectacle ?
o , yes , into a thousand similes .
first , for his weeping into the needless stream , deer , ' quoth he , makest a testament as worldlings do , giving thy sum of more to that which had too much ' then , being there alone , left and abandon of his velvet friends , right ' quoth he , misery doth part the flux of company ' anon a careless herd , full of the pasture , jumps along by him and never stays to greet him , ' quoth jaques , on , you fat and greasy citizens , is just the fashion wherefore do you look upon that poor and broken bankrupt there ? '
thus most invectively he pierceth through the body of the country , city , court , yea , and of this our life , swearing that we are mere usurpers , tyrants and what worse , to fright the animals and to kill them up in their assign and native .
and did you leave him in this contemplation ?
we did , my lord , weeping and commenting upon the sobbing deer .
show me the place i love to cope him in these sullen fits , for then he full of matter .
i bring you to him straight .
exeunt scene ii .
a room in the palace .
enter duke frederick , with lords can it be possible that no man saw them ?
it can not be some villains of my court are of consent and sufferance in this .
i can not hear of any that did see her .
the ladies , her attendants of her chamber , saw her abed , and in the morning early they found the bed untreasured of their mistress .
my lord , the roynish clown , at whom so oft your grace was wont to laugh , is also missing .
hisperia , the princess ' gentlewoman , confesses that she secretly your daughter and her cousin much commend the parts and graces of the wrestler that did but lately foil the sinewy charles , and she believes , wherever they are gone , that youth is surely in their company .
send to his brother , fetch that gallant hither , if he be absent , bring his brother to me , i make him find him do this suddenly , and let not search and inquisition quail to bring again these foolish runaways .
exeunt scene iii .
before oliver house .
enter orlando and adam , meeting who there ?
what , my young master ?
o , my gentle master !
o my sweet master !
o you memory of old sir rowland !
why , what make you here ?
why are you virtuous ?
why do people love you ?
and wherefore are you gentle , strong and valiant ?
why would you be so fond to overcome the bonny priser of the humorous duke ?
your praise is come too swiftly home before you .
know you not , master , to some kind of men their graces serve them but as enemies ?
no more do yours your virtues , gentle master , are sanctified and holy traitors to you .
o , what a world is this , when what is comely envenoms him that bears it !
why , what the matter ?
o unhappy youth !
come not within these doors , within this roof the enemy of all your graces lives your brother no , no brother , yet the son yet not the son , i will not call him son of him i was about to call his father hath heard your praises , and this night he means to burn the lodging where you use to lie and you within it if he fail of that , he will have other means to cut you off .
i overheard him and his practises .
this is no place , this house is but a butchery abhor it , fear it , do not enter it .
why , whither , adam , wouldst thou have me go ?
no matter whither , so you come not here .
what , wouldst thou have me go and beg my food ?
or with a base and boisterous sword enforce a thievish living on the common road ?
this i must do , or know not what to do yet this i will not do , do how i can , i rather will subject me to the malice of a diverted blood and bloody brother .
but do not so .
i have five hundred crowns , the thrifty hire i saved under your father , which i did store to be my when service should in my old limbs lie lame and unregarded age in corners thrown take that , and he that doth the ravens feed , yea , providently caters for the sparrow , be comfort to my age !
here is the gold , and all this i give you .
let me be your servant though i look old , yet i am strong and lusty , for in my youth i never did apply hot and rebellious liquors in my blood , nor did not with unbashful forehead woo the means of weakness and debility , therefore my age is as a lusty winter , frosty , but kindly let me go with you , i do the service of a younger man in all your business and necessities .
o good old man , how well in thee appears the constant service of the antique world , when service sweat for duty , not for meed !
thou art not for the fashion of these times , where none will sweat but for promotion , and having that , do choke their service up even with the having it is not so with thee .
but , poor old man , thou prunest a rotten tree , that can not so much as a blossom yield in lieu of all thy pains and husbandry but come thy ways , well go along together , and ere we have thy youthful wages spent , we light upon some settled low content .
master , go on , and i will follow thee , to the last gasp , with truth and loyalty .
from seventeen years till now almost fourscore here lived i , but now live here no more .
at seventeen years many their fortunes seek , but at fourscore it is too late a week yet fortune can not recompense me better than to die well and not my master debtor .
exeunt scene iv .
the forest of arden .
enter rosalind for ganymede , celia for aliena , and touchstone o jupiter , how weary are my spirits !
i care not for my spirits , if my legs were not weary .
i could find in my heart to disgrace my man apparel and to cry like a woman , but i must comfort the weaker vessel , as doublet and hose ought to show itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage , good aliena !
i pray you , bear with me , i can not go no further .
for my part , i had rather bear with you than bear you , yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you , for i think you have no money in your purse .
well , this is the forest of arden .
ay , now am i in arden , the more fool i , when i was at home , i was in a better place but travellers must be content .
ay , be so , good touchstone .
enter corin and silvius look you , who comes here , a young man and an old in solemn talk .
that is the way to make her scorn you still .
o corin , that thou how i do love her !
i partly guess , for i have loved ere now .
no , corin , being old , thou canst not guess , though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover as ever sigh upon a midnight pillow but if thy love were ever like to mine as sure i think did never man love so how many actions most ridiculous hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy ?
into a thousand that i have forgotten .
o , thou didst then love so heartily !
if thou not the slightest folly that ever love did make thee run into , thou hast not loved or if thou hast not sat as i do now , wearying thy hearer in thy mistress ' praise , thou hast not loved or if thou hast not broke from company abruptly , as my passion now makes me , thou hast not loved .
o phebe , phebe , phebe !
exit alas , poor shepherd !
searching of thy wound , i have by hard adventure found mine own .
and i mine .
i remember , when i was in love i broke my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for coming to jane smile , and i remember the kissing of her batlet and the cow dugs that her pretty chopt hands had milked , and i remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her , from whom i took two cods and , giving her them again , said with weeping tears these for my sake . '
we that are true lovers run into strange capers , but as all is mortal in nature , so is all nature in love mortal in folly .
thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of .
nay , i shall be ware of mine own wit till i break my shins against it .
jove , jove !
this shepherd passion is much upon my fashion .
and mine , but it grows something stale with me .
i pray you , one of you question yond man if he for gold will give us any food i faint almost to death .
holla , you clown !
peace , fool he not thy kinsman .
who calls ?
your betters , sir .
else are they very wretched .
peace , i say .
good even to you , friend .
and to you , gentle sir , and to you all .
i prithee , shepherd , if that love or gold can in this desert place buy entertainment , bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed here a young maid with travel much oppress and faints for succor .
fair sir , i pity her and wish , for her sake more than for mine own , my fortunes were more able to relieve her , but i am shepherd to another man and do not shear the fleeces that i graze my master is of churlish disposition and little recks to find the way to heaven by doing deeds of hospitality besides , his cote , his flocks and bounds of feed are now on sale , and at our sheepcote now , by reason of his absence , there is nothing that you will feed on , but what is , come see .
and in my voice most welcome shall you be .
what is he that shall buy his flock and pasture ?
that young swain that you saw here but erewhile , that little cares for buying any thing .
i pray thee , if it stand with honesty , buy thou the cottage , pasture and the flock , and thou shalt have to pay for it of us .
and we will mend thy wages .
i like this place .
and willingly could waste my time in it .
assuredly the thing is to be sold go with me if you like upon report the soil , the profit and this kind of life , i will your very faithful feeder be and buy it with your gold right suddenly .
exeunt scene the forest .
enter amiens , jaques , and others song .
under the greenwood tree who loves to lie with me , and turn his merry note unto the sweet bird throat , come hither , come hither , come hither here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather .
more , more , i prithee , more .
it will make you melancholy , monsieur jaques .
i thank it .
more , i prithee , more .
i can suck melancholy out of a song , as a weasel sucks eggs .
more , i prithee , more .
my voice is ragged i know i can not please you .
i do not desire you to please me , i do desire you to sing .
come , more , another stanzo call you stanzos ?
what you will , monsieur jaques .
nay , i care not for their names , they owe me nothing .
will you sing ?
more at your request than to please myself .
well then , if ever i thank any man , i thank you , but that they call compliment is like the encounter of two , and when a man thanks me heartily , methinks i have given him a penny and he renders me the beggarly thanks .
come , sing , and you that will not , hold your tongues .
well , i end the song .
sirs , cover the while , the duke will drink under this tree .
he hath been all this day to look you .
and i have been all this day to avoid him .
he is too disputable for my company i think of as many matters as he , but i give heaven thanks and make no boast of them .
come , warble , come .
song .
who doth ambition shun all together here and loves to live i ' the sun , seeking the food he eats and pleased with what he gets , come hither , come hither , come hither here shall he see no enemy but winter and rough weather .
i give you a verse to this note that i made yesterday in despite of my invention .
and i sing it .
thus it goes if it do come to pass that any man turn ass , leaving his wealth and ease , a stubborn will to please , ducdame , ducdame , ducdame here shall he see gross fools as he , an if he will come to me .
what that ' ?
is a greek invocation , to call fools into a circle .
i go sleep , if i can , if i can not , i rail against all the of egypt .
and i go seek the duke his banquet is prepared .
exeunt severally scene vi .
the forest .
enter orlando and adam dear master , i can go no further .
o , i die for food !
here lie i down , and measure out my grave .
farewell , kind master .
why , how now , adam !
no greater heart in thee ?
live a little , comfort a little , cheer thyself a little .
if this uncouth forest yield any thing savage , i will either be food for it or bring it for food to thee .
thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers .
for my sake be comfortable , hold death awhile at the arm end i will here be with thee presently , and if i bring thee not something to eat , i will give thee leave to die but if thou diest before i come , thou art a mocker of my labour .
well said !
thou lookest cheerly , and i be with thee quickly .
yet thou liest in the bleak air come , i will bear thee to some shelter , and thou shalt not die for lack of a dinner , if there live any thing in this desert .
cheerly , good adam !
exeunt scene vii .
the forest .
a table set out .
enter duke senior , amiens , and lords like outlaws i think he be transform into a beast , for i can no where find him like a man .
my lord , he is but even now gone hence here was he merry , hearing of a song .
if he , compact of jars , grow musical , we shall have shortly discord in the spheres .
go , seek him tell him i would speak with him .
enter jaques he saves my labour by his own approach .
why , how now , monsieur !
what a life is this , that your poor friends must woo your company ?
what , you look merrily !
a fool , a fool !
i met a fool i ' the forest , a motley fool , a miserable world !
as i do live by food , i met a fool who laid him down and bask him in the sun , and rail on lady fortune in good terms , in good set terms and yet a motley fool .
morrow , fool , ' quoth i .
, sir , ' quoth he , me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune ' and then he drew a dial from his poke , and , looking on it with eye , says very wisely , is ten thus we may see , ' quoth he , the world wags is but an hour ago since it was nine , and after one hour more be eleven , and so , from hour to hour , we ripe and ripe , and then , from hour to hour , we rot and rot , and thereby hangs a tale . '
when i did hear the motley fool thus moral on the time , my lungs began to crow like chanticleer , that fools should be so , and i did laugh sans intermission an hour by his dial .
o noble fool !
a worthy fool !
motley the only wear .
what fool is this ?
o worthy fool !
one that hath been a courtier , and says , if ladies be but young and fair , they have the gift to know it and in his brain , which is as dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage , he hath strange places cramm with observation , the which he vents in mangled forms .
o that i were a fool !
i am ambitious for a motley coat .
thou shalt have one .
it is my only suit , provided that you weed your better judgments of all opinion that grows rank in them that i am wise .
i must have liberty withal , as large a charter as the wind , to blow on whom i please , for so fools have , and they that are most galled with my folly , they most must laugh .
and why , sir , must they so ?
the ' is plain as way to parish church he that a fool doth very wisely hit doth very foolishly , although he smart , not to seem senseless of the bob if not , the wise man folly is anatomized even by the squandering glances of the fool .
invest me in my motley , give me leave to speak my mind , and i will through and through cleanse the foul body of the infected world , if they will patiently receive my medicine .
fie on thee !
i can tell what thou wouldst do .
what , for a counter , would i do but good ?
most mischievous foul sin , in chiding sin for thou thyself hast been a libertine , as sensual as the brutish sting itself , and all the embossed sores and headed evils , that thou with licence of free foot hast caught , wouldst thou disgorge into the general world .
why , who cries out on pride , that can therein tax any private party ?
doth it not flow as hugely as the sea , till that the weary very means do ebb ?
what woman in the city do i name , when that i say the bears the cost of princes on unworthy shoulders ?
who can come in and say that i mean her , when such a one as she such is her neighbour ?
or what is he of basest function that says his bravery is not of my cost , thinking that i mean him , but therein suits his folly to the mettle of my speech ?
there then , how then ?
what then ?
let me see wherein my tongue hath wrong him if it do him right , then he hath wrong himself , if he be free , why then my taxing like a flies , unclaim of any man .
but who comes here ?
enter orlando , with his sword drawn forbear , and eat no more .
why , i have eat none yet .
nor shalt not , till necessity be served .
of what kind should this cock come of ?
art thou thus bolden , man , by thy distress , or else a rude despiser of good manners , that in civility thou so empty ?
you touch my vein at first the thorny point of bare distress hath from me the show of smooth civility yet am i inland bred and know some nurture .
but forbear , i say he dies that touches any of this fruit till i and my affairs are answered .
an you will not be answered with reason , i must die .
what would you have ?
your gentleness shall force more than your force move us to gentleness .
i almost die for food , and let me have it .
sit down and feed , and welcome to our table .
speak you so gently ?
pardon me , i pray you i thought that all things had been savage here , and therefore put i on the countenance of stern commandment .
but you are that in this desert inaccessible , under the shade of melancholy boughs , lose and neglect the creeping hours of time if ever you have look on better days , if ever been where bells have knoll to church , if ever sat at any good man feast , if ever from your eyelids wiped a tear and know what is to pity and be pitied , let gentleness my strong enforcement be in the which hope i blush , and hide my sword .
true is it that we have seen better days , and have with holy bell been knoll to church and sat at good men feasts and wiped our eyes of drops that sacred pity hath engender and therefore sit you down in gentleness and take upon command what help we have that to your wanting may be minister .
then but forbear your food a little while , whiles , like a doe , i go to find my fawn and give it food .
there is an old poor man , who after me hath many a weary step limp in pure love till he be first sufficed , oppress with two weak evils , age and hunger , i will not touch a bit .
go find him out , and we will nothing waste till you return .
i thank ye , and be blest for your good comfort !
exit thou seest we are not all alone unhappy this wide and universal theatre presents more woeful pageants than the scene wherein we play in .
all the world a stage , and all the men and women merely players they have their exits and their entrances , and one man in his time plays many parts , his acts being seven ages .
at first the infant , mewling and puking in the nurse arms .
and then the whining , with his satchel and shining morning face , creeping like snail unwillingly to school .
and then the lover , sighing like furnace , with a woeful ballad made to his mistress ' eyebrow .
then a soldier , full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard , jealous in honour , sudden and quick in quarrel , seeking the bubble reputation even in the cannon mouth .
and then the justice , in fair round belly with good capon lined , with eyes severe and beard of formal cut , full of wise saws and modern instances , and so he plays his part .
the sixth age shifts into the lean and slipper pantaloon , with spectacles on nose and pouch on side , his youthful hose , well saved , a world too wide for his shrunk shank , and his big manly voice , turning again toward childish treble , pipes and whistles in his sound .
last scene of all , that ends this strange eventful history , is second childishness and mere oblivion , sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything .
orlando , with adam welcome .
set down your venerable burthen , and let him feed .
i thank you most for him .
so had you need i scarce can speak to thank you for myself .
welcome , fall to i will not trouble you as yet , to question you about your fortunes .
give us some music , and , good cousin , sing .
song .
blow , blow , thou winter wind .
thou art not so unkind as man ingratitude , thy tooth is not so keen , because thou art not seen , although thy breath be rude .
!
sing , !
unto the green holly most friendship is feigning , most loving mere folly then , , the holly !
this life is most jolly .
freeze , freeze , thou bitter sky , that dost not bite so nigh as benefits forgot though thou the waters warp , thy sting is not so sharp as friend remember not .
!
sing , and if that you were the good sir rowland son , as you have whisper faithfully you were , and as mine eye doth his effigies witness most truly limn and living in your face , be truly welcome hither i am the duke that loved your father the residue of your fortune , go to my cave and tell me .
good old man , thou art right welcome as thy master is .
support him by the arm .
give me your hand , and let me all your fortunes understand .
exeunt act iii scene i .
a room in the palace .
enter duke frederick , lords , and oliver not see him since ?
sir , sir , that can not be but were i not the better part made mercy , i should not seek an absent argument of my revenge , thou present .
but look to it find out thy brother , he is , seek him with candle , bring him dead or living within this twelvemonth , or turn thou no more to seek a living in our territory .
thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine worth seizure do we seize into our hands , till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth of what we think against thee .
o that your highness knew my heart in this !
i never loved my brother in my life .
more villain thou .
well , push him out of doors , and let my officers of such a nature make an extent upon his house and lands do this expediently and turn him going .
exeunt scene ii .
the forest .
enter orlando , with a paper hang there , my verse , in witness of my love and thou , queen of night , survey with thy chaste eye , from thy pale sphere above , thy huntress ' name that my full life doth sway .
o rosalind !
these trees shall be my books and in their barks my thoughts i character , that every eye which in this forest looks shall see thy virtue witness every where .
run , run , orlando , carve on every tree the fair , the chaste and unexpressive she .
exit enter corin and touchstone and how like you this shepherd life , master touchstone ?
truly , shepherd , in respect of itself , it is a good life , but in respect that it is a shepherd life , it is naught .
in respect that it is solitary , i like it very well , but in respect that it is private , it is a very vile life .
now , in respect it is in the fields , it pleaseth me well , but in respect it is not in the court , it is tedious .
as is it a spare life , look you , it fits my humour well , but as there is no more plenty in it , it goes much against my stomach .
hast any philosophy in thee , shepherd ?
no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at ease he is , and that he that wants money , means and content is without three good friends , that the property of rain is to wet and fire to burn , that good pasture makes fat sheep , and that a great cause of the night is lack of the sun , that he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred .
such a one is a natural philosopher .
wast ever in court , shepherd ?
no , truly .
then thou art damned .
nay , i hope .
truly , thou art damned like an egg , all on one side .
for not being at court ?
your reason .
why , if thou never wast at court , thou never sawest good manners , if thou never sawest good manners , then thy manners must be wicked , and wickedness is sin , and sin is damnation .
thou art in a parlous state , shepherd .
not a whit , touchstone those that are good manners at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the behavior of the country is most mockable at the court .
you told me you salute not at the court , but you kiss your hands that courtesy would be uncleanly , if courtiers were shepherds .
instance , briefly , come , instance .
why , we are still handling our ewes , and their fells , you know , are greasy .
why , do not your courtier hands sweat ?
and is not the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man ?
shallow , shallow .
a better instance , i say , come .
besides , our hands are hard .
your lips will feel them the sooner .
shallow again .
a more sounder instance , come .
and they are often tarred over with the surgery of our sheep and would you have us kiss tar ?
the courtier hands are perfumed with civet .
most shallow man !
thou , in respect of a good piece of flesh indeed !
learn of the wise , and perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar , the very uncleanly flux of a cat .
mend the instance , shepherd .
you have too courtly a wit for me i rest .
wilt thou rest damned ?
god help thee , shallow man !
god make incision in thee !
thou art raw .
sir , i am a true labourer i earn that i eat , get that i wear , owe no man hate , envy no man happiness , glad of other men good , content with my harm , and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes graze and my lambs suck .
that is another simple sin in you , to bring the ewes and the rams together and to offer to get your living by the copulation of cattle , to be bawd to a , and to betray a of a twelvemonth to a , old , cuckoldly ram , out of all reasonable match .
if thou beest not damned for this , the devil himself will have no shepherds , i can not see else how thou shouldst .
here comes young master ganymede , my new mistress brother .
enter rosalind , with a paper , reading from the east to western ind , no jewel is like rosalind .
her worth , being mounted on the wind , through all the world bears rosalind .
all the pictures fairest lined are but black to rosalind .
let no fair be kept in mind but the fair of rosalind .
i rhyme you so eight years together , dinners and suppers and excepted it is the right rank to market .
out , fool !
for a taste if a hart do lack a hind , let him seek out rosalind .
if the cat will after kind , so be sure will rosalind .
winter garments must be lined , so must slender rosalind .
they that reap must sheaf and bind , then to cart with rosalind .
sweetest nut hath sourest rind , such a nut is rosalind .
he that sweetest rose will find must find love prick and rosalind .
this is the very false gallop of verses why do you infect yourself with them ?
peace , you dull fool !
i found them on a tree .
truly , the tree yields bad fruit .
i graff it with you , and then i shall graff it with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit i ' the country , for you be rotten ere you be half ripe , and that the right virtue of the medlar .
you have said , but whether wisely or no , let the forest judge .
enter celia , with a writing peace !
here comes my sister , reading stand aside .
reads why should this a desert be ?
for it is unpeopled ?
no tongues i hang on every tree , that shall civil sayings show some , how brief the life of man runs his erring pilgrimage , that the stretching of a span buckles in his sum of age , some , of violated vows the souls of friend and friend but upon the fairest boughs , or at every sentence end , will i rosalinda write , teaching all that read to know the quintessence of every sprite heaven would in little show .
therefore heaven nature charged that one body should be fill with all graces nature presently distill helen cheek , but not her heart , cleopatra majesty , atalanta better part , sad lucretia modesty .
thus rosalind of many parts by heavenly synod was devised , of many faces , eyes and hearts , to have the touches dearest prized .
heaven would that she these gifts should have , and i to live and die her slave .
o most gentle pulpiter !
what tedious homily of love have you wearied your parishioners withal , and never cried patience , good people ! '
how now !
back , friends !
shepherd , go off a little .
go with him , sirrah .
come , shepherd , let us make an honourable retreat , though not with bag and baggage , yet with scrip and scrippage .
exeunt corin and touchstone didst thou hear these verses ?
o , yes , i heard them all , and more too , for some of them had in them more feet than the verses would bear .
that no matter the feet might bear the verses .
ay , but the feet were lame and could not bear themselves without the verse and therefore stood lamely in the verse .
but didst thou hear without wondering how thy name should be hanged and carved upon these trees ?
i was seven of the nine days out of the wonder before you came , for look here what i found on a .
i was never so since pythagoras ' time , that i was an irish rat , which i can hardly remember .
trow you who hath done this ?
is it a man ?
and a chain , that you once wore , about his neck .
change you colour ?
i prithee , who ?
o lord , lord !
it is a hard matter for friends to meet , but mountains may be removed with earthquakes and so encounter .
nay , but who is it ?
is it possible ?
nay , i prithee now with most petitionary vehemence , tell me who it is .
o wonderful , wonderful , and most wonderful wonderful !
and yet again wonderful , and after that , out of all hooping !
good my complexion !
dost thou think , though i am caparisoned like a man , i have a doublet and hose in my disposition ?
one inch of delay more is a of discovery , i prithee , tell me who is it quickly , and speak apace .
i would thou couldst stammer , that thou mightst pour this concealed man out of thy mouth , as wine comes out of a mouthed bottle , either too much at once , or none at all .
i prithee , take the cork out of thy mouth that may drink thy tidings .
so you may put a man in your belly .
is he of god making ?
what manner of man ?
is his head worth a hat , or his chin worth a beard ?
nay , he hath but a little beard .
why , god will send more , if the man will be thankful let me stay the growth of his beard , if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin .
it is young orlando , that tripped up the wrestler heels and your heart both in an instant .
nay , but the devil take mocking speak , sad brow and true maid .
i ' faith , coz , is he .
orlando ?
orlando .
alas the day !
what shall i do with my doublet and hose ?
what did he when thou sawest him ?
what said he ?
how looked he ?
wherein went he ?
what makes him here ?
did he ask for me ?
where remains he ?
how parted he with thee ?
and when shalt thou see him again ?
answer me in one word .
you must borrow me gargantua mouth first is a word too great for any mouth of this age size .
to say ay and no to these particulars is more than to answer in a catechism .
but doth he know that i am in this forest and in man apparel ?
looks he as freshly as he did the day he wrestled ?
it is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the propositions of a lover , but take a taste of my finding him , and relish it with good observance .
i found him under a tree , like a dropped acorn .
it may well be called jove tree , when it drops forth such fruit .
give me audience , good madam .
proceed .
there lay he , stretched along , like a wounded knight .
though it be pity to see such a sight , it well becomes the ground .
cry ' to thy tongue , i prithee , it curvets unseasonably .
he was furnished like a hunter .
o , ominous !
he comes to kill my heart .
i would sing my song without a burden thou bringest me out of tune .
do you not know i am a woman ?
when i think , i must speak .
sweet , say on .
you bring me out .
soft !
comes he not here ?
enter orlando and jaques is he slink by , and note him .
i thank you for your company , but , good faith , i had as lief have been myself alone .
and so had i , but yet , for fashion sake , i thank you too for your society .
god be wi ' you let meet as little as we can .
i do desire we may be better strangers .
i pray you , mar no more trees with writing in their barks .
i pray you , mar no more of my verses with reading them .
rosalind is your love name ?
yes , just .
i do not like her name .
there was no thought of pleasing you when she was christened .
what stature is she of ?
just as high as my heart .
you are full of pretty answers .
have you not been acquainted with goldsmiths ' wives , and conned them out of rings ?
not so , but i answer you right painted cloth , from whence you have studied your questions .
you have a nimble wit i think was made of atalanta heels .
will you sit down with me ?
and we two will rail against our mistress the world and all our misery .
i will chide no breather in the world but myself , against whom i know most faults .
the worst fault you have is to be in love .
is a fault i will not change for your best virtue .
i am weary of you .
by my troth , i was seeking for a fool when i found you .
he is drowned in the brook look but in , and you shall see him .
there i shall see mine own figure .
which i take to be either a fool or a cipher .
i tarry no longer with you farewell , good signior love .
i am glad of your departure adieu , good monsieur melancholy .
exit jaques aside to celia i will speak to him , like a saucy lackey and under that habit play the knave with him .
do you hear , forester ?
very well what would you ?
i pray you , what ?
you should ask me what time o ' day there no clock in the forest .
then there is no true lover in the forest , else sighing every minute and groaning every hour would detect the lazy foot of time as well as a clock .
and why not the swift foot of time ?
had not that been as proper ?
by no means , sir time travels in divers paces with divers persons .
i tell you who time ambles withal , who time trots withal , who time gallops withal and who he stands still withal .
i prithee , who doth he trot withal ?
marry , he trots hard with a young maid between the contract of her marriage and the day it is solemnized if the interim be but a , time pace is so hard that it seems the length of seven year .
who ambles time withal ?
with a priest that lacks latin and a rich man that hath not the gout , for the one sleeps easily because he can not study , and the other lives merrily because he feels no pain , the one lacking the burden of lean and wasteful learning , the other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury , these time ambles withal .
who doth he gallop withal ?
with a thief to the gallows , for though he go as softly as foot can fall , he thinks himself too soon there .
who stays it still withal ?
with lawyers in the vacation , for they sleep between term and term and then they perceive not how time moves .
where dwell you , pretty youth ?
with this shepherdess , my sister , here in the skirts of the forest , like fringe upon a petticoat .
are you native of this place ?
as the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled .
your accent is something finer than you could purchase in so removed a dwelling .
i have been told so of many but indeed an old religious uncle of mine taught me to speak , who was in his youth an inland man , one that knew courtship too well , for there he fell in love .
i have heard him read many lectures against it , and i thank god i am not a woman , to be touched with so many giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their whole sex withal .
can you remember any of the principal evils that he laid to the charge of women ?
there were none principal , they were all like one another as are , every one fault seeming monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it .
i prithee , recount some of them .
no , i will not cast away my physic but on those that are sick .
there is a man haunts the forest , that abuses our young plants with carving ' on their barks , hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies on brambles , all , forsooth , deifying the name of rosalind if i could meet that i would give him some good counsel , for he seems to have the quotidian of love upon him .
i am he that is so i pray you tell me your remedy .
there is none of my uncle marks upon you he taught me how to know a man in love , in which cage of rushes i am sure you are not prisoner .
what were his marks ?
a lean cheek , which you have not , a blue eye and sunken , which you have not , an unquestionable spirit , which you have not , a beard neglected , which you have not , but i pardon you for that , for simply your having in beard is a younger brother revenue then your hose should be ungartered , your bonnet unbanded , your sleeve unbuttoned , your shoe untied and every thing about you demonstrating a careless desolation , but you are no such man , you are rather in your accoutrements as loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other .
fair youth , i would i could make thee believe i love .
me believe it !
you may as soon make her that you love believe it , which , i warrant , she is apter to do than to confess she does that is one of the points in the which women still give the lie to their consciences .
but , in good sooth , are you he that hangs the verses on the trees , wherein rosalind is so admired ?
i swear to thee , youth , by the white hand of rosalind , i am that he , that unfortunate he .
but are you so much in love as your rhymes speak ?
neither rhyme nor reason can express how much .
love is merely a madness , and , i tell you , deserves as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and the reason why they are not so punished and cured is , that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers are in love too .
yet i profess curing it by counsel .
did you ever cure any so ?
yes , one , and in this manner .
he was to imagine me his love , his mistress , and i set him every day to woo me at which time would i , being but a moonish youth , grieve , be effeminate , changeable , longing and liking , proud , fantastical , apish , shallow , inconstant , full of tears , full of smiles , for every passion something and for no passion truly any thing , as boys and women are for the most part cattle of this colour , would now like him , now loathe him , then entertain him , then forswear him , now weep for him , then spit at him , that i drave my suitor from his mad humour of love to a living humour of madness , which was , to forswear the full stream of the world , and to live in a nook merely monastic .
and thus i cured him , and this way will i take upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep heart , that there shall not be one spot of love i .
i would not be cured , youth .
i would cure you , if you would but call me rosalind and come every day to my cote and woo me .
now , by the faith of my love , i will tell me where it is .
go with me to it and i show it you and by the way you shall tell me where in the forest you live .
will you go ?
with all my heart , good youth .
nay you must call me rosalind .
come , sister , will you go ?
exeunt scene iii .
the forest .
enter touchstone and audrey , jaques behind come apace , good audrey i will fetch up your goats , audrey .
and how , audrey ?
am i the man yet ?
doth my simple feature content you ?
your features !
lord warrant us !
what features !
i am here with thee and thy goats , as the most capricious poet , honest ovid , was among the goths .
aside o knowledge , worse than jove in a thatched house !
when a man verses can not be understood , nor a man good wit seconded with the forward child understanding , it strikes a man more dead than a great reckoning in a little room .
truly , i would the gods had made thee poetical .
i do not know what ' is is it honest in deed and word ?
is it a true thing ?
no , truly , for the truest poetry is the most feigning , and lovers are given to poetry , and what they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign .
do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical ?
i do , truly , for thou swearest to me thou art honest now , if thou wert a poet , i might have some hope thou didst feign .
would you not have me honest ?
no , truly , unless thou wert , for honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar .
aside a material fool !
well , i am not fair , and therefore i pray the gods make me honest .
truly , and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut were to put good meat into an unclean dish .
i am not a slut , though i thank the gods i am foul .
well , praised be the gods for thy foulness !
sluttishness may come hereafter .
but be it as it may be , i will marry thee , and to that end i have been with sir oliver martext , the vicar of the next village , who hath promised to meet me in this place of the forest and to couple us .
aside i would fain see this meeting .
well , the gods give us joy !
amen .
a man may , if he were of a fearful heart , stagger in this attempt , for here we have no temple but the wood , no assembly but .
but what though ?
c ourage !
as horns are odious , they are necessary .
it is said , a man knows no end of his goods ' right , many a man has good horns , and knows no end of them .
well , that is the dowry of his wife , is none of his own getting .
horns ?
even so .
poor men alone ?
no , no , the noblest deer hath them as huge as the rascal .
is the single man therefore blessed ?
no as a walled town is more worthier than a village , so is the forehead of a married man more honourable than the bare brow of a bachelor , and by how much defence is better than no skill , by so much is a horn more precious than to want .
here comes sir oliver .
enter sir oliver martext sir oliver martext , you are well met will you dispatch us here under this tree , or shall we go with you to your chapel ?
is there none here to give the woman ?
i will not take her on gift of any man .
truly , she must be given , or the marriage is not lawful .
advancing proceed , proceed i give her .
good even , good master how do you , sir ?
you are very well met god you for your last company i am very glad to see you even a toy in hand here , sir nay , pray be covered .
will you be married , motley ?
as the ox hath his bow , sir , the horse his curb and the falcon her bells , so man hath his desires , and as pigeons bill , so wedlock would be nibbling .
and will you , being a man of your breeding , be married under a bush like a beggar ?
get you to church , and have a good priest that can tell you what marriage is this fellow will but join you together as they join wainscot , then one of you will prove a shrunk panel and , like green timber , warp , warp .
aside i am not in the mind but i were better to be married of him than of another for he is not like to marry me well , and not being well married , it will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife .
go thou with me , and let me counsel thee .
, sweet audrey we must be married , or we must live in bawdry .
farewell , good master oliver not , o sweet oliver , o brave oliver , leave me not behind thee but , wind away , begone , i say , i will not to wedding with thee .
exeunt jaques , touchstone and audrey is no matter a fantastical knave of them all shall flout me out of my calling .
exit scene iv .
the forest .
enter rosalind and celia never talk to me , i will weep .
do , i prithee , but yet have the grace to consider that tears do not become a man .
but have i not cause to weep ?
as good cause as one would desire , therefore weep .
his very hair is of the dissembling colour .
something browner than judas marry , his kisses are judas own children .
i ' faith , his hair is of a good colour .
an excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour .
and his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch of holy bread .
he hath bought a pair of cast lips of diana a nun of winter sisterhood kisses not more religiously , the very ice of chastity is in them .
but why did he swear he would come this morning , and comes not ?
nay , certainly , there is no truth in him .
do you think so ?
yes , i think he is not a nor a , but for his verity in love , i do think him as concave as a covered goblet or a nut .
not true in love ?
yes , when he is in , but i think he is not in .
you have heard him swear downright he was .
' is not ' besides , the oath of a lover is no stronger than the word of a tapster , they are both the confirmer of false reckonings .
he attends here in the forest on the duke your father .
i met the duke yesterday and had much question with him he asked me of what parentage i was , i told him , of as good as he , so he laughed and let me go .
but what talk we of fathers , when there is such a man as orlando ?
o , that a brave man !
he writes brave verses , speaks brave words , swears brave oaths and breaks them bravely , quite traverse , athwart the heart of his lover , as a puisny tilter , that spurs his horse but on one side , breaks his staff like a noble goose but all brave that youth mounts and folly guides .
who comes here ?
enter corin mistress and master , you have oft inquired after the shepherd that complain of love , who you saw sitting by me on the turf , praising the proud disdainful shepherdess that was his mistress .
well , and what of him ?
if you will see a pageant truly play , between the pale complexion of true love and the red glow of scorn and proud disdain , go hence a little and i shall conduct you , if you will mark it .
o , come , let us remove the sight of lovers feedeth those in love .
bring us to this sight , and you shall say i prove a busy actor in their play .
exeunt scene another part of the forest .
enter silvius and phebe sweet phebe , do not scorn me , do not , phebe , say that you love me not , but say not so in bitterness .
the common executioner , whose heart the accustom sight of death makes hard , falls not the axe upon the humbled neck but first begs pardon will you sterner be than he that dies and lives by bloody drops ?
enter rosalind , celia , and corin , behind i would not be thy executioner i fly thee , for i would not injure thee .
thou me there is murder in mine eye is pretty , sure , and very probable , that eyes , that are the and softest things , who shut their coward gates on atomies , should be call tyrants , butchers , murderers !
now i do frown on thee with all my heart , and if mine eyes can wound , now let them kill thee now counterfeit to swoon , why now fall down , or if thou canst not , o , for shame , for shame , lie not , to say mine eyes are murderers !
now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee scratch thee but with a pin , and there remains some scar of it , lean but upon a rush , the cicatrice and capable impressure thy palm some moment keeps , but now mine eyes , which i have darted at thee , hurt thee not , nor , i am sure , there is no force in eyes that can do hurt .
o dear phebe , if ever , as that ever may be near , you meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy , then shall you know the wounds invisible that love keen arrows make .
but till that time come not thou near me and when that time comes , afflict me with thy mocks , pity me not , as till that time i shall not pity thee .
and why , i pray you ?
who might be your mother , that you insult , exult , and all at once , over the wretched ?
what though you have no beauty , as , by my faith , i see no more in you than without candle may go dark to bed must you be therefore proud and pitiless ?
why , what means this ?
why do you look on me ?
i see no more in you than in the ordinary of nature .
my little life , i think she means to tangle my eyes too !
no , faith , proud mistress , hope not after it is not your inky brows , your black silk hair , your bugle eyeballs , nor your cheek of cream , that can entame my spirits to your worship .
you foolish shepherd , wherefore do you follow her , like foggy south puffing with wind and rain ?
you are a thousand times a properer man than she a woman is such fools as you that makes the world full of children is not her glass , but you , that flatters her , and out of you she sees herself more proper than any of her lineaments can show her .
but , mistress , know yourself down on your knees , and thank heaven , fasting , for a good man love for i must tell you friendly in your ear , sell when you can you are not for all markets cry the man mercy , love him , take his offer foul is most foul , being foul to be a scoffer .
so take her to thee , shepherd fare you well .
sweet youth , i pray you , chide a year together i had rather hear you chide than this man woo .
he fallen in love with your foulness and she fall in love with my anger .
if it be so , as fast as she answers thee with frowning looks , i sauce her with bitter words .
why look you so upon me ?
for no ill will i bear you .
i pray you , do not fall in love with me , for i am falser than vows made in wine besides , i like you not .
if you will know my house , is at the tuft of olives here hard by .
will you go , sister ?
shepherd , ply her hard .
come , sister .
shepherdess , look on him better , and be not proud though all the world could see , none could be so abused in sight as he .
come , to our flock .
exeunt rosalind , celia and corin dead shepherd , now i find thy saw of might , ever loved that loved not at first sight ? '
sweet phebe , ha , what thou , silvius ?
sweet phebe , pity me .
why , i am sorry for thee , gentle silvius .
wherever sorrow is , relief would be if you do sorrow at my grief in love , by giving love your sorrow and my grief were both extermined .
thou hast my love is not that neighbourly ?
i would have you .
why , that were covetousness .
silvius , the time was that i hated thee , and yet it is not that i bear thee love , but since that thou canst talk of love so well , thy company , which erst was irksome to me , i will endure , and i employ thee too but do not look for further recompense than thine own gladness that thou art employ .
so holy and so perfect is my love , and i in such a poverty of grace , that i shall think it a most plenteous crop to glean the broken ears after the man that the main harvest reaps loose now and then a scatter smile , and that i live upon .
now the youth that spoke to me erewhile ?
not very well , but i have met him oft , and he hath bought the cottage and the bounds that the old carlot once was master of .
think not i love him , though i ask for him is but a peevish boy , yet he talks well , but what care i for words ?
yet words do well when he that speaks them pleases those that hear .
it is a pretty youth not very pretty but , sure , he proud , and yet his pride becomes him he make a proper man the best thing in him is his complexion , and faster than his tongue did make offence his eye did heal it up .
he is not very tall , yet for his years he tall his leg is but so so , and yet is well there was a pretty redness in his lip , a little riper and more lusty red than that mix in his cheek , was just the difference between the constant red and mingled damask .
there be some women , silvius , had they mark him in parcels as i did , would have gone near to fall in love with him , but , for my part , i love him not nor hate him not , and yet i have more cause to hate him than to love him for what had he to do to chide at me ?
he said mine eyes were black and my hair black and , now i am remember , scorn at me i marvel why i answer not again but that all one , omittance is no quittance .
i write to him a very taunting letter , and thou shalt bear it wilt thou , silvius ?
phebe , with all my heart .
i write it straight , the matter in my head and in my heart i will be bitter with him and passing short .
go with me , silvius .
exeunt act iv scene i .
the forest .
enter rosalind , celia , and jaques i prithee , pretty youth , let me be better acquainted with thee .
they say you are a melancholy fellow .
i am so , i do love it better than laughing .
those that are in extremity of either are abominable fellows and betray themselves to every modern censure worse than drunkards .
why , is good to be sad and say nothing .
why then , is good to be a post .
i have neither the scholar melancholy , which is emulation , nor the musician , which is fantastical , nor the courtier , which is proud , nor the soldier , which is ambitious , nor the lawyer , which is politic , nor the lady , which is nice , nor the lover , which is all these but it is a melancholy of mine own , compounded of many simples , extracted from many objects , and indeed the sundry contemplation of my travels , in which my often rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness .
a traveller !
by my faith , you have great reason to be sad i fear you have sold your own lands to see other men , then , to have seen much and to have nothing , is to have rich eyes and poor hands .
yes , i have gained my experience .
and your experience makes you sad i had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad , and to travel for it too !
enter orlando good day and happiness , dear rosalind !
nay , then , god be wi ' you , an you talk in blank verse .
exit farewell , monsieur traveller look you lisp and wear strange suits , disable all the benefits of your own country , be out of love with your nativity and almost chide god for making you that countenance you are , or i will scarce think you have swam in a gondola .
why , how now , orlando !
where have you been all this while ?
you a lover !
an you serve me such another trick , never come in my sight more .
my fair rosalind , i come within an hour of my promise .
break an hour promise in love !
he that will divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the affairs of love , it may be said of him that cupid hath clapped him o ' the shoulder , but i warrant him .
pardon me , dear rosalind .
nay , an you be so tardy , come no more in my sight i had as lief be wooed of a snail .
of a snail ?
ay , of a snail , for though he comes slowly , he carries his house on his head , a better jointure , i think , than you make a woman besides he brings his destiny with him .
what that ?
why , horns , which such as you are fain to be beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife .
virtue is no , and my rosalind is virtuous .
and i am your rosalind .
it pleases him to call you so , but he hath a rosalind of a better leer than you .
come , woo me , woo me , for now i am in a holiday humour and like enough to consent .
what would you say to me now , an i were your very very rosalind ?
i would kiss before i spoke .
nay , you were better speak first , and when you were gravelled for lack of matter , you might take occasion to kiss .
very good orators , when they are out , they will spit , and for lovers lacking god warn us ! matter , the cleanliest shift is to kiss .
how if the kiss be denied ?
then she puts you to entreaty , and there begins new matter .
who could be out , being before his beloved mistress ?
marry , that should you , if i were your mistress , or i should think my honesty ranker than my wit .
what , of my suit ?
not out of your apparel , and yet out of your suit .
am not i your rosalind ?
i take some joy to say you are , because i would be talking of her .
well in her person i say i will not have you .
then in mine own person i die .
no , faith , die by attorney .
the poor world is almost six thousand years old , and in all this time there was not any man died in his own person , videlicit , in a .
troilus had his brains dashed out with a grecian club , yet he did what he could to die before , and he is one of the patterns of love .
leander , he would have lived many a fair year , though hero had turned nun , if it had not been for a hot midsummer night , for , good youth , he went but forth to wash him in the hellespont and being taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish coroners of that age found it was of sestos . '
but these are all lies men have died from time to time and worms have eaten them , but not for love .
i would not have my right rosalind of this mind , for , i protest , her frown might kill me .
by this hand , it will not kill a fly .
but come , now i will be your rosalind in a more disposition , and ask me what you will .
i will grant it .
then love me , rosalind .
yes , faith , will i , fridays and saturdays and all .
and wilt thou have me ?
ay , and twenty such .
what sayest thou ?
are you not good ?
i hope so .
why then , can one desire too much of a good thing ?
come , sister , you shall be the priest and marry us .
give me your hand , orlando .
what do you say , sister ?
pray thee , marry us .
i can not say the words .
you must begin , you , orlando ' go to .
will you , orlando , have to wife this rosalind ?
i will .
ay , but when ?
why now , as fast as she can marry us .
then you must say ' i take thee , rosalind , for wife . '
i take thee , rosalind , for wife .
i might ask you for your commission , but i do take thee , orlando , for my husband there a girl goes before the priest , and certainly a woman thought runs before her actions .
so do all thoughts , they are winged .
now tell me how long you would have her after you have possessed her .
for ever and a day .
say ' a day , ' without the . '
no , no , orlando , men are april when they woo , december when they wed maids are may when they are maids , but the sky changes when they are wives .
i will be more jealous of thee than a barbary over his hen , more clamorous than a parrot against rain , more than an ape , more giddy in my desires than a monkey i will weep for nothing , like diana in the fountain , and i will do that when you are disposed to be merry , i will laugh like a hyen , and that when thou art inclined to sleep .
but will my rosalind do so ?
by my life , she will do as i do .
o , but she is wise .
or else she could not have the wit to do this the wiser , the waywarder make the doors upon a woman wit and it will out at the casement , shut that and out at the , stop that , fly with the smoke out at the chimney .
a man that had a wife with such a wit , he might say , whither wilt ? '
nay , you might keep that cheque for it till you met your wife wit going to your neighbour bed .
and what wit could wit have to excuse that ?
marry , to say she came to seek you there .
you shall never take her without her answer , unless you take her without her tongue .
o , that woman that can not make her fault her husband occasion , let her never nurse her child herself , for she will breed it like a fool !
for these two hours , rosalind , i will leave thee .
alas !
dear love , i can not lack thee two hours .
i must attend the duke at dinner by two i will be with thee again .
ay , go your ways , go your ways , i knew what you would prove my friends told me as much , and i thought no less that flattering tongue of yours won me is but one cast away , and so , come , death !
two is your hour ?
ay , sweet rosalind .
by my troth , and in good earnest , and so god mend me , and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous , if you break one jot of your promise or come one minute behind your hour , i will think you the most pathetical and the most hollow lover and the most unworthy of her you call rosalind that may be chosen out of the gross band of the unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep your promise .
with no less religion than if thou wert indeed my rosalind so adieu .
well , time is the old justice that examines all such offenders , and let time try adieu .
exit orlando you have simply misused our sex in your we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your head , and show the world what the bird hath done to her own nest .
o coz , coz , coz , my pretty little coz , that thou didst know how many fathom deep i am in love !
but it can not be sounded my affection hath an unknown bottom , like the bay of portugal .
or rather , bottomless , that as fast as you pour affection in , it runs out .
no , that same wicked bastard of venus that was begot of thought , conceived of spleen and born of madness , that blind rascally boy that abuses every one eyes because his own are out , let him be judge how deep i am in love .
i tell thee , aliena , i can not be out of the sight of orlando i go find a shadow and sigh till he come .
and i sleep .
exeunt scene ii .
the forest .
enter jaques , lords , and foresters which is he that killed the deer ?
sir , it was i .
let present him to the duke , like a roman conqueror , and it would do well to set the deer horns upon his head , for a branch of victory .
have you no song , forester , for this purpose ?
yes , sir .
sing it is no matter how it be in tune , so it make noise enough .
song .
what shall he have that kill the deer ?
his leather skin and horns to wear .
then sing him home , the rest shall bear this burden take thou no scorn to wear the horn , it was a crest ere thou wast born thy father father wore it , and thy father bore it the horn , the horn , the lusty horn is not a thing to laugh to scorn .
exeunt scene iii .
the forest .
enter rosalind and celia how say you now ?
is it not past two ?
and here much orlando !
i warrant you , with pure love and troubled brain , he hath his bow and arrows and is gone forth to sleep .
look , who comes here .
enter silvius my errand is to you , fair youth , my gentle phebe bid me give you this i know not the contents , but , as i guess by the stern brow and waspish action which she did use as she was writing of it , it bears an angry tenor pardon me i am but as a guiltless messenger .
patience herself would startle at this letter and play the swaggerer , bear this , bear all she says i am not fair , that i lack manners , she calls me proud , and that she could not love me , were man as rare as phoenix .
my will !
her love is not the hare that i do hunt why writes she so to me ?
well , shepherd , well , this is a letter of your own device .
no , i protest , i know not the contents phebe did write it .
come , come , you are a fool and turn into the extremity of love .
i saw her hand she has a leathern hand .
a hand , i verily did think that her old gloves were on , but was her hands she has a huswife hand , but that no matter i say she never did invent this letter , this is a man invention and his hand .
sure , it is hers .
why , is a boisterous and a cruel style .
a style , why , she defies me , like turk to christian women gentle brain could not drop forth such invention such ethiope words , blacker in their effect than in their countenance .
will you hear the letter ?
so please you , for i never heard it yet , yet heard too much of phebe cruelty .
she phebes me mark how the tyrant writes .
reads art thou god to shepherd turn , that a maiden heart hath burn ?
can a woman rail thus ?
call you this railing ?
reads why , thy godhead laid apart , thou with a woman heart ?
did you ever hear such railing ?
whiles the eye of man did woo me , that could do no vengeance to me .
meaning me a beast .
if the scorn of your bright eyne have power to raise such love in mine , alack , in me what strange effect would they work in mild aspect !
whiles you chid me , i did love , how then might your prayers move !
he that brings this love to thee little knows this love in me and by him seal up thy mind , whether that thy youth and kind will the faithful offer take of me and all that i can make , or else by him my love deny , and then i study how to die .
call you this chiding ?
alas , poor shepherd !
do you pity him ?
no , he deserves no pity .
wilt thou love such a woman ?
what , to make thee an instrument and play false strains upon thee !
not to be endured !
well , go your way to her , for i see love hath made thee a tame snake , and say this to her that if she love me , i charge her to love thee , if she will not , i will never have her unless thou entreat for her .
if you be a true lover , hence , and not a word , for here comes more company .
exit silvius enter oliver good morrow , fair ones pray you , if you know , where in the purlieus of this forest stands a fenced about with olive trees ?
west of this place , down in the neighbour bottom the rank of osiers by the murmuring stream left on your right hand brings you to the place .
but at this hour the house doth keep itself , there none within .
if that an eye may profit by a tongue , then should i know you by description , such garments and such years boy is fair , of female favour , and bestows himself like a ripe sister the woman low and browner than her brother . '
are not you the owner of the house i did inquire for ?
it is no boast , being ask , to say we are .
orlando doth commend him to you both , and to that youth he calls his rosalind he sends this bloody napkin .
are you he ?
i am what must we understand by this ?
some of my shame , if you will know of me what man i am , and how , and why , and where this handkercher was stain .
i pray you , tell it .
when last the young orlando parted from you he left a promise to return again within an hour , and pacing through the forest , chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy , lo , what befell !
he threw his eye aside , and mark what object did present itself under an oak , whose boughs were moss with age and high top bald with dry antiquity , a wretched ragged man , with hair , lay sleeping on his back about his neck a green and gilded snake had wreathed itself , who with her head nimble in threats approach the opening of his mouth , but suddenly , seeing orlando , it unlink itself , and with indented glides did slip away into a bush under which bush shade a lioness , with udders all drawn dry , lay couching , head on ground , with catlike watch , when that the sleeping man should stir , for is the royal disposition of that beast to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead this seen , orlando did approach the man and found it was his brother , his elder brother .
o , i have heard him speak of that same brother , and he did render him the most unnatural that lived amongst men .
and well he might so do , for well i know he was unnatural .
but , to orlando did he leave him there , food to the suck and hungry lioness ?
twice did he turn his back and purposed so , but kindness , nobler ever than revenge , and nature , stronger than his just occasion , made him give battle to the lioness , who quickly fell before him in which hurtling from miserable slumber i awaked .
are you his brother ?
wast you he rescued ?
you that did so oft contrive to kill him ?
was i , but is not i i do not shame to tell you what i was , since my conversion so sweetly tastes , being the thing i am .
but , for the bloody napkin ?
by and by .
when from the first to last betwixt us two tears our recountments had most kindly bathed , as how i came into that desert place in brief , he led me to the gentle duke , who gave me fresh array and entertainment , committing me unto my brother love , who led me instantly unto his cave , there stripp himself , and here upon his arm the lioness had torn some flesh away , which all this while had bled , and now he fainted and cried , in fainting , upon rosalind .
brief , i recover him , bound up his wound , and , after some small space , being strong at heart , he sent me hither , stranger as i am , to tell this story , that you might excuse his broken promise , and to give this napkin dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth that he in sport doth call his rosalind .
rosalind swoons why , how now , ganymede !
sweet ganymede !
many will swoon when they do look on blood .
there is more in it .
cousin ganymede !
look , he recovers .
i would i were at home .
we lead you thither .
i pray you , will you take him by the arm ?

and loving woo ?
and , wooing , she should grant ?
and will you persever to enjoy her ?
neither call the giddiness of it in question , the poverty of her , the small acquaintance , my sudden wooing , nor her sudden consenting , but say with me , i love aliena , say with her that she loves me , consent with both that we may enjoy each other it shall be to your good , for my father house and all the revenue that was old sir rowland will i estate upon you , and here live and die a shepherd .
you have my consent .
let your wedding be thither will i invite the duke and all contented followers .
go you and prepare aliena , for look you , here comes my rosalind .
enter rosalind god save you , brother .
and you , fair sister .
exit o , my dear orlando , how it grieves me to see thee wear thy heart in a scarf !
it is my arm .
i thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws of a lion .
wounded it is , but with the eyes of a lady .
did your brother tell you how i counterfeited to swoon when he showed me your handkerchief ?
ay , and greater wonders than that .
o , i know where you are nay , is true there was never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams and caesar thrasonical brag of ' i came , saw , and overcame ' for your brother and my sister no sooner met but they looked , no sooner looked but they loved , no sooner loved but they sighed , no sooner sighed but they asked one another the reason , no sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy , and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs to marriage which they will climb incontinent , or else be incontinent before marriage they are in the very wrath of love and they will together , clubs can not part them .
they shall be married , and i will bid the duke to the nuptial .
but , o , how bitter a thing it is to look into happiness through another man eyes !
by so much the more shall i be at the height of , by how much i shall think my brother happy in having what he wishes for .
why then , i can not serve your turn for rosalind ?
i can live no longer by thinking .
i will weary you then no longer with idle talking .
know of me then , for now i speak to some purpose , that i know you are a gentleman of good conceit i speak not this that you should bear a good opinion of my knowledge , insomuch i say i know you are , neither do i labour for a greater esteem than may in some little measure draw a belief from you , to do yourself good and not to grace me .
believe then , if you please , that i can do strange things i have , since i was three year old , conversed with a magician , most profound in his art and yet not damnable .
if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries it out , when your brother marries aliena , shall you marry her i know into what straits of fortune she is driven , and it is not impossible to me , if it appear not inconvenient to you , to set her before your eyes tomorrow human as she is and without any danger .
speakest thou in sober meanings ?
by my life , i do , which i tender dearly , though i say i am a magician .
therefore , put you in your best array bid your friends , for if you will be married , you shall , and to rosalind , if you will .

song .
it was a lover and his lass , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , that the green did pass in the spring time , the only pretty ring time , when birds do sing , hey ding a ding , ding sweet lovers love the spring .
between the acres of the rye , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino these pretty country folks would lie , in spring time , and this carol they began that hour , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , how that a life was but a flower in spring time , and and therefore take the present time , with a hey , and a ho , and a hey nonino , for love is crowned with the prime in spring time , and truly , young gentlemen , though there was no great matter in the ditty , yet the note was very untuneable .
you are deceived , sir we kept time , we lost not our time .

enter duke senior , amiens , jaques , orlando , oliver , and celia dost thou believe , orlando , that the boy can do all this that he hath promised ?
i sometimes do believe , and sometimes do not , as those that fear they hope , and know they fear .
enter rosalind , silvius , and phebe patience once more , whiles our compact is urged you say , if i bring in your rosalind , you will bestow her on orlando here ?
that would i , had i kingdoms to give with her .
and you say , you will have her , when i bring her ?
that would i , were i of all kingdoms king .
you say , you marry me , if i be willing ?
that will i , should i die the hour after .
but if you do refuse to marry me , you give yourself to this most faithful shepherd ?
so is the bargain .
you say , that you have phebe , if she will ?
though to have her and death were both one thing .
i have promised to make all this matter even .
keep you your word , o duke , to give your daughter , you yours , orlando , to receive his daughter keep your word , phebe , that you marry me , or else refusing me , to wed this shepherd keep your word , silvius , that you marry her .
if she refuse me and from hence i go , to make these doubts all even .
exeunt rosalind and celia i do remember in this shepherd boy some lively touches of my daughter favour .
my lord , the first time that i ever saw him methought he was a brother to your daughter but , my good lord , this boy is , and hath been tutor in the rudiments of many desperate studies by his uncle , whom he reports to be a great magician , obscured in the circle of this forest .
enter touchstone and audrey there is , sure , another flood toward , and these couples are coming to the ark .
here comes a pair of very strange beasts , which in all tongues are called fools .
salutation and greeting to you all !
good my lord , bid him welcome this is the gentleman that i have so often met in the forest he hath been a courtier , he swears .
if any man doubt that , let him put me to my purgation .
i have trod a measure , i have flattered a lady , i have been politic with my friend , smooth with mine enemy , i have undone three tailors , i have had four quarrels , and like to have fought one .
and how was that up ?
faith , we met , and found the quarrel was upon the seventh cause .
how seventh cause ?
good my lord , like this fellow .
i like him very well .
god you , sir , i desire you of the like .
i press in here , sir , amongst the rest of the country copulatives , to swear and to forswear according as marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin , sir , an thing , sir , but mine own , a poor humour of mine , sir , to take that that no man else will rich honesty dwells like a miser , sir , in a poor house , as your pearl in your foul oyster .
by my faith , he is very swift and sententious .
according to the fool bolt , sir , and such dulcet diseases .
but , for the seventh cause , how did you find the quarrel on the seventh cause ?
upon a lie seven times removed bear your body more seeming , audrey as thus , sir .
i did dislike the cut of a certain courtier beard he sent me word , if i said his beard was not cut well , he was in the mind it was this is called the retort courteous .
if i sent him word again was not well cut , ' he would send me word , he cut it to please himself this is called the quip modest .
if again was not well cut , ' he disabled my judgment this is called the reply churlish .
if again was not well cut , ' he would answer , i spake not true this is called the reproof valiant .
if again was not well cut , ' he would say i lied this is called the quarrelsome and so to the lie circumstantial and the lie direct .
and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut ?
i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial , nor he durst not give me the lie direct , and so we measured swords and parted .
can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie ?
o sir , we quarrel in print , by the book , as you have books for good manners i will name you the degrees .
the first , the retort courteous , the second , the quip modest , the third , the reply churlish , the fourth , the reproof valiant , the fifth , the countercheque quarrelsome , the sixth , the lie with circumstance , the seventh , the lie direct .
all these you may avoid but the lie direct , and you may avoid that too , with an if .
i knew when seven justices could not take up a quarrel , but when the parties were met themselves , one of them thought but of an if , as , you said so , then i said so , ' and they shook hands and swore brothers .
your if is the only peacemaker , much virtue in if .
is not this a rare fellow , my lord ?
he as good at any thing and yet a fool .
he uses his folly like a and under the presentation of that he shoots his wit .
enter hymen , rosalind , and celia still music then is there mirth in heaven , when earthly things made even atone together .
good duke , receive thy daughter hymen from heaven brought her , yea , brought her hither , that thou mightst join her hand with his whose heart within his bosom is .
to duke senior to you i give myself , for i am yours .
to orlando to you i give myself , for i am yours .
if there be truth in sight , you are my daughter .
if there be truth in sight , you are my rosalind .
if sight and shape be true , why then , my love adieu !
i have no father , if you be not he i have no husband , if you be not he nor wed woman , if you be not she .
peace , ho !
i bar confusion is i must make conclusion of these most strange events here eight that must take hands to join in hymen bands , if truth holds true contents .
you and you no cross shall part you and you are heart in heart you to his love must accord , or have a woman to your lord you and you are sure together , as the winter to foul weather .

o my dear niece , welcome thou art to me !
even daughter , welcome , in no less degree .
i will not eat my word , now thou art mine , thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine .
enter jaques de boys let me have audience for a word or two i am the second son of old sir rowland , that bring these tidings to this fair assembly .
duke frederick , hearing how that every day men of great worth resorted to this forest , address a mighty power , which were on foot , in his own conduct , purposely to take his brother here and put him to the sword and to the skirts of this wild wood he came , where meeting with an old religious man , after some question with him , was converted both from his enterprise and from the world , his crown bequeathing to his banish brother , and all their lands restored to them again that were with him exiled .
this to be true , i do engage my life .
welcome , young man , thou fairly to thy brothers ' wedding to one his lands withheld , and to the other a land itself at large , a potent dukedom .
first , in this forest , let us do those ends that here were well begun and well begot and after , every of this happy number that have endured shrewd days and nights with us shall share the good of our returned fortune , according to the measure of their states .
meantime , forget this dignity and fall into our rustic revelry .
play , music !
and you , brides and bridegrooms all , with measure heap in joy , to the measures fall .
sir , by your patience .
if i heard you rightly , the duke hath put on a religious life and thrown into neglect the pompous court ?
he hath .
to him will i out of these convertites there is much matter to be heard and learn .
to duke senior you to your former honour i bequeath , your patience and your virtue well deserves it to orlando you to a love that your true faith doth merit to oliver you to your land and love and great allies to silvius you to a long and bed to touchstone and you to wrangling , for thy loving voyage is but for two months victuall .
so , to your pleasures i am for other than for dancing measures .
stay , jaques , stay .
to see no pastime i what you would have i stay to know at your abandon cave .
exit proceed , proceed we will begin these rites , as we do trust they end , in true delights .
a dance epilogue it is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue , but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord the prologue .
if it be true that good wine needs no bush , is true that a good play needs no epilogue , yet to good wine they do use good bushes , and good plays prove the better by the help of good epilogues .
what a case am i in then , that am neither a good epilogue nor can not insinuate with you in the behalf of a good play !
i am not furnished like a beggar , therefore to beg will not become me my way is to conjure you , and i begin with the women .
i charge you , o women , for the love you bear to men , to like as much of this play as please you and i charge you , o men , for the love you bear to women as i perceive by your simpering , none of you hates them that between you and the women the play may please .
if i were a woman i would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased me , complexions that liked me and breaths that i defied not and , i am sure , as many as have good beards or good faces or sweet breaths will , for my kind offer , when i make curtsy , bid me farewell .

exeunt mark antony and cleopatra with their train is caesar with antonius prized so slight ?

enobarbus !
madam ?

where alexas ?
here , at your service .
my lord approaches .
we will not look upon him go with us .
exeunt enter mark antony with a messenger and attendants fulvia thy wife first came into the field .
against my brother lucius ?
ay but soon that war had end , and the time state made friends of them , joining their force caesar , whose better issue in the war , from italy , upon the first encounter , drave them .
well , what worst ?
the nature of bad news infects the teller .
when it concerns the fool or coward .
on things that are past are done with me .
is thus who tells me true , though in his tale lie death , i hear him as he flatter .
labienus this is stiff news hath , with his parthian force , extended asia from euphrates , his conquering banner shook from syria to lydia and to ionia , whilst antony , thou wouldst say , o , my lord !
speak to me home , mince not the general tongue name cleopatra as she is call in rome , rail thou in fulvia phrase , and taunt my faults with such full licence as both truth and malice have power to utter .
o , then we bring forth weeds , when our quick minds lie still , and our ills told us is as our earing .
fare thee well awhile .
at your noble pleasure .
exit from sicyon , ho , the news !
speak there !
the man from sicyon , is there such an one ?
he stays upon your will .
let him appear .
these strong egyptian fetters i must break , or lose myself in dotage .
enter another messenger what are you ?
fulvia thy wife is dead .
where died she ?
in sicyon her length of sickness , with what else more serious importeth thee to know , this bears .
gives a letter forbear me .
exit second messenger there a great spirit gone !
thus did i desire it what our contempt doth often hurl from us , we wish it ours again , the present pleasure , by revolution lowering , does become the opposite of itself she good , being gone , the hand could pluck her back that shoved her on .
i must from this enchanting queen break off ten thousand harms , more than the ills i know , my idleness doth hatch .
how now !
enobarbus !
domitius enobarbus what your pleasure , sir ?
i must with haste from hence .
why , then , we kill all our women we see how mortal an unkindness is to them , if they suffer our departure , death the word .
i must be gone .
under a compelling occasion , let women die , it were pity to cast them away for nothing , though , between them and a great cause , they should be esteemed nothing .
cleopatra , catching but the least noise of this , dies instantly , i have seen her die twenty times upon far poorer moment i do think there is mettle in death , which commits some loving act upon her , she hath such a celerity in dying .
she is cunning past man thought .
exit alexas alack , sir , no , her passions are made of nothing but the finest part of pure love we can not call her winds and waters sighs and tears , they are greater storms and tempests than almanacs can report this can not be cunning in her , if it be , she makes a shower of rain as well as jove .
would i had never seen her .
o , sir , you had then left unseen a wonderful piece of work , which not to have been blest withal would have discredited your travel .
fulvia is dead .
sir ?
fulvia is dead .
fulvia !
dead .
why , sir , give the gods a thankful sacrifice .
when it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man from him , it shows to man the tailors of the earth , comforting therein , that when old robes are worn out , there are members to make new .
if there were no more women but fulvia , then had you indeed a cut , and the case to be lamented this grief is crowned with consolation , your old smock brings forth a new petticoat and indeed the tears live in an onion that should water this sorrow .
the business she hath broached in the state can not endure my absence .
and the business you have broached here can not be without you , especially that of cleopatra , which wholly depends on your abode .
no more light answers .
let our officers have notice what we purpose .
i shall break the cause of our expedience to the queen , and get her leave to part .
for not alone the death of fulvia , with more urgent touches , do strongly speak to us , but the letters too of many our contriving friends in rome petition us at home sextus pompeius hath given the dare to caesar , and commands the empire of the sea our slippery people , whose love is never link to the deserver till his deserts are past , begin to throw pompey the great and all his dignities upon his son , who , high in name and power , higher than both in blood and life , stands up for the main soldier whose quality , going on , the sides o ' the world may danger much is breeding , which , like the courser hair , hath yet but life , and not a serpent poison .
say , our pleasure , to such whose place is under us , requires our quick remove from hence .
i shall .

enter mark antony i am sick and sullen .
i am sorry to give breathing to my purpose , help me away , dear charmian , i shall fall it can not be thus long , the sides of nature will not sustain it .
now , my dearest queen , pray you , stand further from me .
what the matter ?
i know , by that same eye , there some good news .
what says the married woman ?
you may go would she had never given you leave to come !
let her not say is i that keep you here i have no power upon you , hers you are .
the gods best know , o , never was there queen so mightily betray !
yet at the first i saw the treasons planted .
cleopatra , why should i think you can be mine and true , though you in swearing shake the throned gods , who have been false to fulvia ?
riotous madness , to be entangled with those vows , which break themselves in swearing !
most sweet queen , nay , pray you , seek no colour for your going , but bid farewell , and go when you sued staying , then was the time for words no going then , eternity was in our lips and eyes , bliss in our brows ' bent , none our parts so poor , but was a race of heaven they are so still , or thou , the greatest soldier of the world , art turn the greatest liar .
how now , lady !
i would i had thy inches , thou shouldst know there were a heart in egypt .
hear me , queen the strong necessity of time commands our services awhile , but my full heart remains in use with you .
our italy shines with civil swords sextus pompeius makes his approaches to the port of rome equality of two domestic powers breed scrupulous faction the hated , grown to strength , are newly grown to love the condemn pompey , rich in his father honour , creeps apace , into the hearts of such as have not thrived upon the present state , whose numbers threaten , and quietness , grown sick of rest , would purge by any desperate change my more particular , and that which most with you should safe my going , is fulvia death .
though age from folly could not give me freedom , it does from childishness can fulvia die ?
she dead , my queen look here , and at thy sovereign leisure read the garboils she awaked , at the last , best see when and where she died .
o most false love !
where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill with sorrowful water ?
now i see , i see , in fulvia death , how mine received shall be .
quarrel no more , but be prepared to know the purposes i bear , which are , or cease , as you shall give the advice .
by the fire that quickens nilus ' slime , i go from hence thy soldier , servant , making peace or war as thou .
cut my lace , charmian , come , but let it be i am quickly ill , and well , so antony loves .
my precious queen , forbear , and give true evidence to his love , which stands an honourable trial .
so fulvia told me .
i prithee , turn aside and weep for her , then bid adieu to me , and say the tears belong to egypt good now , play one scene of excellent dissembling , and let it look life perfect honour .
you heat my blood no more .
you can do better yet , but this is meetly .
now , by my sword , and target .
still he mends , but this is not the best .
look , prithee , charmian , how this herculean roman does become the carriage of his chafe .
i leave you , lady .
courteous lord , one word .
sir , you and i must part , but that not it sir , you and i have loved , but there not it , that you know well something it is i would , o , my oblivion is a very antony , and i am all forgotten .
but that your royalty holds idleness your subject , i should take you for idleness itself .
is sweating labour to bear such idleness so near the heart as cleopatra this .
but , sir , forgive me , since my becomings kill me , when they do not eye well to you your honour calls you hence , therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly .
and all the gods go with you !
upon your sword sit laurel victory !
and smooth success be strew before your feet !
let us go .
come , our separation so abides , and flies , that thou , residing here , yet with me , and i , hence fleeting , here remain with thee .
away !

i must not think there are evils enow to darken all his goodness his faults in him seem as the spots of heaven , more fiery by night blackness , hereditary , rather than purchased , what he can not change , than what he chooses .
you are too indulgent .
let us grant , it is not amiss to tumble on the bed of ptolemy , to give a kingdom for a mirth , to sit and keep the turn of tippling with a slave , to reel the streets at noon , and stand the buffet with knaves that smell of sweat say this becomes him , as his composure must be rare indeed whom these things can not blemish , yet must antony no way excuse his soils , when we do bear so great weight in his lightness .
if he fill his vacancy with his voluptuousness , full surfeits , and the dryness of his bones , call on him but to confound such time , that drums him from his sport , and speaks as loud as his own state and ours , is to be chid as we rate boys , who , being mature in knowledge , pawn their experience to their present pleasure , and so rebel to judgment .
enter a messenger here more news .
thy biddings have been done , and every hour , most noble caesar , shalt thou have report how is abroad .
pompey is strong at sea , and it appears he is beloved of those that only have fear caesar to the ports the discontents repair , and men reports give him much wrong .
i should have known no less .
it hath been taught us from the primal state , that he which is was wish until he were , and the ebb man , loved till worth love , comes dear by being lack .
this common body , like to a vagabond flag upon the stream , goes to and back , lackeying the varying tide , to rot itself with motion .
caesar , i bring thee word , menecrates and menas , famous pirates , make the sea serve them , which they ear and wound with keels of every kind many hot inroads they make in italy , the borders maritime lack blood to think o , and flush youth revolt no vessel can peep forth , but is as soon taken as seen , for pompey name strikes more than could his war resisted .
antony , leave thy lascivious wassails .
when thou once wast beaten from modena , where thou hirtius and pansa , consuls , at thy heel did famine follow , whom thou against , though daintily brought up , with patience more than savages could suffer thou didst drink the stale of horses , and the gilded puddle which beasts would cough at thy palate then did deign the roughest berry on the rudest hedge , yea , like the stag , when snow the pasture sheets , the barks of trees thou , on the alps it is reported thou didst eat strange flesh , which some did die to look on and all this it wounds thine honour that i speak it now was borne so like a soldier , that thy cheek so much as lank not .
is pity of him .
let his shames quickly drive him to rome is time we twain did show ourselves i ' the field , and to that end assemble we immediate council pompey thrives in our idleness .
, caesar , i shall be furnish to inform you rightly both what by sea and land i can be able to front this present time .
till which encounter , it is my business too .
farewell .
farewell , my lord what you shall know meantime of stirs abroad , i shall beseech you , sir , to let me be partaker .

yes , gracious madam .

not in deed , madam , for i can do nothing but what indeed is honest to be done yet have i fierce affections , and think what venus did with mars .

caesar , when thou wast here above the ground , i was a morsel for a monarch and great pompey would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow , there would he anchor his aspect and die with looking on his life .
enter alexas , from octavius caesar sovereign of egypt , hail !
how much unlike art thou mark antony !
yet , coming from him , that great medicine hath with his tinct gilded thee .
how goes it with my brave mark antony ?
last thing he did , dear queen , he kiss , the last of many doubled kisses , this orient pearl .
his speech sticks in my heart .
mine ear must pluck it thence .
friend , ' quoth he , , the firm roman to great egypt sends this treasure of an oyster , at whose foot , to mend the petty present , i will piece her opulent throne with kingdoms , all the east , say thou , shall call her mistress . '
so he nodded , and soberly did mount an steed , who neigh so high , that what i would have spoke was beastly dumb by him .
what , was he sad or merry ?
like to the time o ' the year between the extremes of hot and cold , he was nor sad nor merry .
o disposition !
note him , note him good charmian , is the man , but note him he was not sad , for he would shine on those that make their looks by his , he was not merry , which seem to tell them his remembrance lay in egypt with his joy , but between both o heavenly mingle !
thou sad or merry , the violence of either thee becomes , so does it no man else .

ay , madam , twenty several messengers why do you send so thick ?
who born that day when i forget to send to antony , shall die a beggar .

welcome , my good alexas .
did i , charmian , ever love caesar so ?
o that brave caesar !
be choked with such another emphasis !
say , the brave antony .
the valiant caesar !

know , worthy pompey , that what they do delay , they not deny .
whiles we are suitors to their throne , decays the thing we sue for .
we , ignorant of ourselves , beg often our own harms , which the wise powers deny us for our good , so find we profit by losing of our prayers .
i shall do well the people love me , and the sea is mine , my powers are crescent , and my auguring hope says it will come to the full .

where have you this ?

i can not hope caesar and antony shall well greet together his wife that dead did trespasses to caesar , his brother warr upon him , although , i think , not moved by antony .
i know not , menas , how lesser enmities may give way to greater .
not that we stand up against them all , pregnant they should square between themselves , for they have entertained cause enough to draw their swords but how the fear of us may cement their divisions and bind up the petty difference , we yet not know .

what amiss , may it be gently heard when we debate our trivial difference loud , we do commit murder in healing wounds then , noble partners , the rather , for i earnestly beseech , touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms , nor curstness grow to the matter .
is spoken well .
were we before our armies , and to fight .

flourish welcome to rome .
thank you .

nay , then .
i learn , you take things ill which are not so , or being , concern you not .
i must be laugh at , if , or for nothing or a little , i should say myself offended , and with you chiefly i ' the world , more laugh at , that i should once name you derogately , when to sound your name it not concern me .
my being in egypt , caesar , what to you ?
no more than my residing here at rome might be to you in egypt yet , if you there did practise on my state , your being in egypt might be my question .
how intend you , practised ?
you may be pleased to catch at mine intent by what did here befal me .
your wife and brother made wars upon me , and their contestation was theme for you , you were the word of war .
you do mistake your business , my brother never did urge me in his act i did inquire it , and have my learning from some true reports , that drew their swords with you .
did he not rather discredit my authority with yours , and make the wars alike against my stomach , having alike your cause ?
of this my letters before did satisfy you .
if you patch a quarrel , as matter whole you have not to make it with , it must not be with this .
you praise yourself by laying defects of judgment to me , but you patch up your excuses .
not so , not so , i know you could not lack , i am certain o , very necessity of this thought , that i , your partner in the cause which he fought , could not with graceful eyes attend those wars which fronted mine own peace .
as for my wife , i would you had her spirit in such another the third o ' the world is yours , which with a snaffle you may pace easy , but not such a wife .
would we had all such wives , that the men might go to wars with the women !
so much uncurbable , her garboils , caesar made out of her impatience , which not wanted shrewdness of policy too , i grieving grant did you too much disquiet for that you must but say , i could not help it .
i wrote to you when rioting in alexandria , you did pocket up my letters , and with taunts did gibe my missive out of audience .
sir , he fell upon me ere admitted then three kings i had newly feasted , and did want of what i was i ' the morning but next day i told him of myself , which was as much as to have ask him pardon .
let this fellow be nothing of our strife , if we contend , out of our question wipe him .
you have broken the article of your oath , which you shall never have tongue to charge me with .
soft , caesar !
no , lepidus , let him speak the honour is sacred which he talks on now , supposing that i lack it .
but , on , caesar , the article of my oath .
to lend me arms and aid when i required them , the which you both denied .
neglected , rather , and then when poison hours had bound me up from mine own knowledge .
as nearly as i may , i play the penitent to you but mine honesty shall not make poor my greatness , nor my power work without it .
truth is , that fulvia , to have me out of egypt , made wars here , for which myself , the ignorant motive , do so far ask pardon as befits mine honour to stoop in such a case .
is noble spoken .
if it might please you , to enforce no further the griefs between ye to forget them quite were to remember that the present need speaks to atone you .
worthily spoken , mecaenas .
or , if you borrow one another love for the instant , you may , when you hear no more words of pompey , return it again you shall have time to wrangle in when you have nothing else to do .
thou art a soldier only speak no more .
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot .
you wrong this presence , therefore speak no more .
go to , then , your considerate stone .
i do not much dislike the matter , but the manner of his speech , can not be we shall remain in friendship , our conditions so differing in their acts .
yet if i knew what hoop should hold us stanch , from edge to edge o ' the world i would pursue it .
give me leave , caesar , speak , agrippa .
thou hast a sister by the mother side , admired octavia great mark antony is now a widower .
say not so , agrippa if cleopatra heard you , your reproof were well deserved of rashness .
i am not married , caesar let me hear agrippa further speak .
to hold you in perpetual amity , to make you brothers , and to knit your hearts with an unslipping knot , take antony octavia to his wife , whose beauty claims no worse a husband than the best of men , whose virtue and whose general graces speak that which none else can utter .
by this marriage , all little jealousies , which now seem great , and all great fears , which now import their dangers , would then be nothing truths would be tales , where now half tales be truths her love to both would , each to other and all loves to both , draw after her .
pardon what i have spoke , for is a studied , not a present thought , by duty ruminated .
will caesar speak ?
not till he hears how antony is touch with what is spoke already .
what power is in agrippa , if i would say , , be it so , ' to make this good ?
the power of caesar , and his power unto octavia .
may i never to this good purpose , that so fairly shows , dream of impediment !
let me have thy hand further this act of grace and from this hour the heart of brothers govern in our loves and sway our great designs !
there is my hand .
a sister i bequeath you , whom no brother did ever love so dearly let her live to join our kingdoms and our hearts , and never fly off our loves again !
happily , amen !
i did not think to draw my sword pompey , for he hath laid strange courtesies and great of late upon me i must thank him only , lest my remembrance suffer ill report , at heel of that , defy him .
time calls upon of us must pompey presently be sought , or else he seeks out us .
where lies he ?
about the mount misenum .
what is his strength by land ?
great and increasing but by sea he is an absolute master .
so is the fame .
would we had spoke together !
haste we for it yet , ere we put ourselves in arms , dispatch we the business we have talk of .
with most gladness and do invite you to my sister view , whither straight i lead you .
let us , lepidus , not lack your company .
noble antony , not sickness should detain me .
flourish .
exeunt octavius caesar , mark antony , and lepidus welcome from egypt , sir .
half the heart of caesar , worthy mecaenas !
my honourable friend , agrippa !
good enobarbus !
we have cause to be glad that matters are so well digested .
you stayed well by in egypt .
ay , sir , we did sleep day out of countenance , and made the night light with drinking .
eight roasted whole at a breakfast , and but twelve persons there , is this true ?
this was but as a fly by an eagle we had much more monstrous matter of feast , which worthily deserved noting .
she a most triumphant lady , if report be square to her .
when she first met mark antony , she pursed up his heart , upon the river of cydnus .
there she appeared indeed , or my reporter devised well for her .
i will tell you .
the barge she sat in , like a burnish throne , burn on the water the poop was beaten gold , purple the sails , and so perfumed that the winds were with them , the oars were silver , which to the tune of flutes kept stroke , and made the water which they beat to follow faster , as amorous of their strokes .
for her own person , it beggar all description she did lie in her pavilion of tissue that venus where we see the fancy outwork nature on each side her stood pretty dimpled boys , like smiling cupids , with fans , whose wind did seem to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool , and what they undid did .
o , rare for antony !
her gentlewomen , like the nereides , so many mermaids , tended her i ' the eyes , and made their bends adornings at the helm a seeming mermaid steers the silken tackle swell with the touches of those hands , that yarely frame the office .
from the barge a strange invisible perfume hits the sense of the adjacent wharfs .
the city cast her people out upon her , and antony , enthroned i ' the , did sit alone , whistling to the air , which , but for vacancy , had gone to gaze on cleopatra too , and made a gap in nature .
rare egyptian !
upon her landing , antony sent to her , invited her to supper she replied , it should be better he became her guest , which she entreated our courteous antony , whom the word of ' woman heard speak , being barber ten times , goes to the feast , and for his ordinary pays his heart for what his eyes eat only .
royal wench !
she made great caesar lay his sword to bed he plough her , and she cropp .
i saw her once hop forty paces through the public street , and having lost her breath , she spoke , and panted , that she did make defect perfection , and , breathless , power breathe forth .
now antony must leave her utterly .
never , he will not age can not wither her , nor custom stale her infinite variety other women cloy the appetites they feed but she makes hungry where most she satisfies , for vilest things become themselves in her that the holy priests bless her when she is riggish .
if beauty , wisdom , modesty , can settle the heart of antony , octavia is a blessed lottery to him .
let us go .

bid you alexas to mardian bring me word how tall she is .
pity me , charmian , but do not speak to me .
lead me to my chamber .
exeunt scene vi .
near misenum .
flourish .
enter pompey and menas at one door , with drum and trumpet at another , octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , domitius enobarbus , mecaenas , with soldiers marching your hostages i have , so have you mine , and we shall talk before we fight .
most meet that first we come to words , and therefore have we our written purposes before us sent , which , if thou hast consider , let us know if tie up thy discontented sword , and carry back to sicily much tall youth that else must perish here .
to you all three , the senators alone of this great world , chief factors for the gods , i do not know wherefore my father should revengers want , having a son and friends , since julius caesar , who at philippi the good brutus ghosted , there saw you labouring for him .
what that moved pale cassius to conspire , and what made the , honest roman , brutus , with the arm rest , courtiers and beauteous freedom , to drench the capitol , but that they would have one man but a man ?
and that is it hath made me rig my navy , at whose burthen the anger ocean foams , with which i meant to scourge the ingratitude that despiteful rome cast on my noble father .
take your time .
thou canst not fear us , pompey , with thy sails , we speak with thee at sea at land , thou how much we do thee .
at land , indeed , thou dost me of my father house but , since the cuckoo builds not for himself , remain i as thou mayst .
be pleased to tell us for this is from the present how you take the offers we have sent you .
there the point .
which do not be entreated to , but weigh what it is worth embraced .
and what may follow , to try a larger fortune .
you have made me offer of sicily , sardinia , and i must rid all the sea of pirates , then , to send measures of wheat to rome , this upon to part with unhack edges , and bear back our targes undinted .
that our offer .
know , then , i came before you here a man prepared to take this offer but mark antony put me to some impatience though i lose the praise of it by telling , you must know , when caesar and your brother were at blows , your mother came to sicily and did find her welcome friendly .
i have heard it , pompey , and am well studied for a liberal thanks which i do owe you .
let me have your hand i did not think , sir , to have met you here .
the beds i ' the east are soft , and thanks to you , that call me timelier than my purpose hither , for i have gain by .
since i saw you last , there is a change upon you .
well , i know not what counts harsh fortune casts upon my face , but in my bosom shall she never come , to make my heart her vassal .
well met here .
i hope so , lepidus .
thus we are agreed i crave our composition may be written , and seal between us .
that the next to do .
we feast each other ere we part , and let draw lots who shall begin .
that will i , pompey .
no , antony , take the lot but , first or last , your fine egyptian cookery shall have the fame .
i have heard that julius caesar grew fat with feasting there .
you have heard much .
i have fair meanings , sir .
and fair words to them .
then so much have i heard and i have heard , apollodorus carried no more of that he did so .
what , i pray you ?
a certain queen to caesar in a mattress .
i know thee now how farest thou , soldier ?
well , and well am like to do , for , i perceive , four feasts are toward .
let me shake thy hand , i never hated thee i have seen thee fight , when i have envied thy behavior .
sir , i never loved you much , but i ha ' praised ye , when you have well deserved ten times as much as i have said you did .
enjoy thy plainness , it nothing ill becomes thee .
aboard my galley i invite you all will you lead , lords ?
show us the way , sir .
come .
exeunt all but menas and enobarbus aside thy father , pompey , would have made this you and i have known , sir .
at sea , i think .
we have , sir .
you have done well by water .
and you by land .
i will praise any man that will praise me , though it can not be denied what i have done by land .
nor what i have done by water .
yes , something you can deny for your own safety you have been a great thief by sea .
and you by land .
there i deny my land service .
but give me your hand , menas if our eyes had authority , here they might take two thieves kissing .
all men faces are true , their hands are .
but there is never a fair woman has a true face .
no slander , they steal hearts .
we came hither to fight with you .
for my part , i am sorry it is turned to a drinking .
pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune .
if he do , sure , he can not back again .
you said , sir .
we looked not for mark antony here pray you , is he married to cleopatra ?
caesar sister is called octavia .
true , sir , she was the wife of caius marcellus .
but she is now the wife of marcus antonius .
pray ye , sir ?
is true .
then is caesar and he for ever knit together .
if i were bound to divine of this unity , i would not prophesy so .
i think the policy of that purpose made more in the marriage than the love of the parties .
i think so too .
but you shall find , the band that seems to tie their friendship together will be the very strangler of their amity octavia is of a holy , cold , and still conversation .
who would not have his wife so ?
not he that himself is not so , which is mark antony .
he will to his egyptian dish again then shall the sighs of octavia blow the fire up in caesar , and , as i said before , that which is the strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their variance .
antony will use his affection where it is he married but his occasion here .
and thus it may be .
come , sir , will you aboard ?
i have a health for you .
i shall take it , sir we have used our throats in egypt .
come , let away .

music plays .
enter two or three servants with a banquet here they be , man .
some o ' their plants are already the least wind i ' the world will blow them down .
lepidus is .
they have made him drink .
as they pinch one another by the disposition , he cries out more , ' reconciles them to his entreaty , and himself to the drink .
but it raises the greater war between him and his discretion .
why , this is to have a name in great men fellowship i had as lief have a reed that will do me no service as a partisan i could not heave .
to be called into a huge sphere , and not to be seen to move i , are the holes where eyes should be , which pitifully disaster the cheeks .
a sennet sounded .
enter octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , pompey , agrippa , mecaenas , domitius enobarbus , menas , with other captains to octavius caesar thus do they , sir they take the flow o ' the nile by certain scales i ' the pyramid , they know , by the height , the lowness , or the mean , if dearth or foison follow the higher nilus swells , the more it promises as it ebbs , the seedsman upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain , and shortly comes to harvest .
you strange serpents there .
ay , lepidus .
your serpent of egypt is bred now of your mud by the operation of your sun so is your crocodile .
they are so .
sit , and some wine !
a health to lepidus !
i am not so well as i should be , but i out .
not till you have slept , i fear me you be in till then .
nay , certainly , i have heard the ptolemies ' pyramises are very goodly things , without contradiction , i have heard that .
aside to pompey pompey , a word .
aside to menas say in mine ear what ?
aside to pompey forsake thy seat , i do beseech thee , captain , and hear me speak a word .
aside to menas forbear me till anon .
this wine for lepidus !
what manner o ' thing is your crocodile ?
it is shaped , sir , like itself , and it is as broad as it hath breadth it is just so high as it is , and moves with its own organs it lives by that which nourisheth it , and the elements once out of it , it transmigrates .
what colour is it of ?
of it own colour too .
is a strange serpent .
is so .
and the tears of it are wet .
will this description satisfy him ?
with the health that pompey gives him , else he is a very epicure .
aside to menas go hang , sir , hang !
tell me of that ?
away !
do as i bid you .
where this cup i call for ?
aside to pompey if for the sake of merit thou wilt hear me , rise from thy stool .
aside to menas i think mad .
the matter ?
rises , and walks aside i have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes .
thou hast served me with much faith .
what else to say ?
be jolly , lords .
these , lepidus , keep off them , for you sink .
wilt thou be lord of all the world ?
what thou ?
wilt thou be lord of the whole world ?
that twice .
how should that be ?
but entertain it , and , though thou think me poor , i am the man will give thee all the world .
hast thou drunk well ?
now , pompey , i have kept me from the cup .
thou art , if thou darest be , the earthly jove the ocean pales , or sky inclips , is thine , if thou wilt .
show me which way .
these three , these competitors , are in thy vessel let me cut the cable , and , when we are put off , fall to their throats all there is thine .
ah , this thou shouldst have done , and not have spoke o !
in me is villany , in had been good service .
thou must know , is not my profit that does lead mine honour , mine honour , it .
repent that thy tongue hath so betray thine act being done unknown , i should have found it afterwards well done , but must condemn it now .
desist , and drink .
aside for this , i never follow thy pall fortunes more .
who seeks , and will not take when once is offer , shall never find it more .
this health to lepidus !
bear him ashore .
i pledge it for him , pompey .
here to thee , menas !
enobarbus , welcome !
fill till the cup be hid .
there a strong fellow , menas .
pointing to the attendant who carries off lepidus why ?
a ' bears the third part of the world , man , not ?
the third part , then , is drunk would it were all , that it might go on wheels !
drink thou , increase the reels .
come .
this is not yet an alexandrian feast .
it ripens towards it .
strike the vessels , ho ?
here is to caesar !
i could well .
it monstrous labour , when i wash my brain , and it grows fouler .
be a child o ' the time .
possess it , i make answer but i had rather fast from all four days than drink so much in one .
ha , my brave emperor !
to mark antony shall we dance now the egyptian bacchanals , and celebrate our drink ?
let , good soldier .
come , let all take hands , till that the conquering wine hath steep our sense in soft and delicate lethe .
all take hands .
make battery to our ears with the loud music the while i place you then the boy shall sing , the holding every man shall bear as loud as his strong sides can volley .
music plays .
domitius enobarbus places them hand in hand the song .
come , thou monarch of the vine , plumpy bacchus with pink eyne !
in thy fats our cares be drown , with thy grapes our hairs be crown cup us , till the world go round , cup us , till the world go round !
what would you more ?
pompey , good night .
good brother , let me request you off our graver business frowns at this levity .
gentle lords , let part , you see we have burnt our cheeks strong enobarb is weaker than the wine , and mine own tongue splits what it speaks the wild disguise hath almost antick us all .
what needs more words ?
good night .
good antony , your hand .
i try you on the shore .
and shall , sir , give your hand .
o antony , you have my father house , but , what ?
we are friends .
come , down into the boat .
take heed you fall not .

enter ventidius as it were in triumph , with silius , and other romans , officers , and soldiers , the dead body of pacorus borne before him now , darting parthia , art thou struck , and now pleased fortune does of marcus crassus ' death make me revenger .
bear the king son body before our army .
thy pacorus , orodes , pays this for marcus crassus .
noble ventidius , whilst yet with parthian blood thy sword is warm , the fugitive parthians follow , spur through media , mesopotamia , and the shelters whither the routed fly so thy grand captain antony shall set thee on triumphant chariots and put garlands on thy head .
o silius , silius , i have done enough , a lower place , note well , may make too great an act for learn this , silius , better to leave undone , than by our deed acquire too high a fame when him we serve away .
caesar and antony have ever won more in their officer than person sossius , one of my place in syria , his lieutenant , for quick accumulation of renown , which he achieved by the minute , lost his favour .
who does i ' the wars more than his captain can becomes his captain captain and ambition , the soldier virtue , rather makes choice of loss , than gain which darkens him .
i could do more to do antonius good , but offend him , and in his offence should my performance perish .
thou hast , ventidius , that without the which a soldier , and his sword , grants scarce distinction .
thou wilt write to antony !
i humbly signify what in his name , that magical word of war , we have effected , how , with his banners and his ranks , the horse of parthia we have jaded out o ' the field .
where is he now ?
he purposeth to athens whither , with what haste the weight we must convey with will permit , we shall appear before him .
on there , pass along !

they have dispatch with pompey , he is gone , the other three are sealing .
octavia weeps to part from rome , caesar is sad , and lepidus , since pompey feast , as menas says , is troubled with the green sickness .
is a noble lepidus .
a very fine one o , how he loves caesar !
nay , but how dearly he adores mark antony !
caesar ?
why , he the jupiter of men .
what antony ?
the god of jupiter .
spake you of caesar ?
how !
the !
o antony !
o thou arabian bird !
would you praise caesar , say ' go no further .
indeed , he plied them both with excellent praises .
but he loves caesar best , yet he loves antony ho !
hearts , tongues , figures , scribes , bards , poets , can not think , speak , cast , write , sing , number , ho !
his love to antony .
but as for caesar , kneel down , kneel down , and wonder .
both he loves .
they are his shards , and he their beetle .
trumpets within so , this is to horse .
adieu , noble agrippa .
good fortune , worthy soldier , and farewell .
enter octavius caesar , mark antony , lepidus , and octavia no further , sir .
you take from me a great part of myself , use me well in .
sister , prove such a wife as my thoughts make thee , and as my farthest band shall pass on thy approof .
most noble antony , let not the piece of virtue , which is set betwixt us as the cement of our love , to keep it builded , be the ram to batter the fortress of it , for better might we have loved without this mean , if on both parts this be not cherish .
make me not offended in your distrust .
i have said .
you shall not find , though you be therein curious , the least cause for what you seem to fear so , the gods keep you , and make the hearts of romans serve your ends !
we will here part .
farewell , my dearest sister , fare thee well the elements be kind to thee , and make thy spirits all of comfort !
fare thee well .
my noble brother !
the april in her eyes it is love spring , and these the showers to bring it on .
be cheerful .
sir , look well to my husband house , and what , octavia ?
i tell you in your ear .
her tongue will not obey her heart , nor can her heart inform her tongue , the swan , that stands upon the swell at full of tide , and neither way inclines .
aside to agrippa will caesar weep ?
aside to domitius enobarbus he has a cloud in face .
aside to agrippa he were the worse for that , were he a horse , so is he , being a man .
aside to domitius enobarbus why , enobarbus , when antony found julius caesar dead , he cried almost to roaring , and he wept when at philippi he found brutus slain .
aside to agrippa that year , indeed , he was troubled with a rheum , what willingly he did confound he wail , , till i wept too .
no , sweet octavia , you shall hear from me still , the time shall not my thinking on you .
come , sir , come , i wrestle with you in my strength of love look , here i have you , thus i let you go , and give you to the gods .
adieu , be happy !

farewell , fa rewell !

ay , dread queen .

she is not , madam .
didst hear her speak ?
is she or low ?
madam , i heard her speak , she is .
that not so good he can not like her long .
like her !
o isis !
is impossible .
i think so , charmian dull of tongue , and dwarfish !
what majesty is in her gait ?
remember , if thou on majesty .
she creeps her motion and her station are as one , she shows a body rather than a life , a statue than a breather .
is this certain ?
or i have no observance .
three in egypt can not make better note .
he very knowing , i do there nothing in her yet the fellow has good judgment .
excellent .
guess at her years , i prithee .
madam , she was a widow , widow !
charmian , hark .
and i do think she thirty .

thou must not take my former sharpness ill i will employ thee back again , i find thee most fit for business go make thee ready , our letters are prepared .

o my good lord , believe not all , or , if you must believe , stomach not all .
a more unhappy lady , if this division chance , stood between , praying for both parts the good gods me presently , when i shall pray , ' o bless my lord and husband ! '
undo that prayer , by crying out as loud , ' o , bless my brother ! '
husband win , win brother , prays , and destroys the prayer , no midway these extremes at all .
gentle octavia , let your best love draw to that point , which seeks best to preserve it if i lose mine honour , i lose myself better i were not yours than yours so branchless .
but , as you requested , yourself shall go between the mean time , lady , i raise the preparation of a war shall stain your brother make your soonest haste , so your desires are yours .
thanks to my lord .
the jove of power make me most weak , most weak , your reconciler !
wars you twain would be as if the world should cleave , and that slain men should solder up the rift .
when it appears to you where this begins , turn your displeasure that way for our faults can never be so equal , that your love can equally move with them .

there strange news come , sir .
what , man ?
caesar and lepidus have made wars upon pompey .
this is old what is the success ?
caesar , having made use of him in the wars pompey , presently denied him rivality , would not let him partake in the glory of the action and not resting here , accuses him of letters he had formerly wrote to pompey , upon his own appeal , seizes him so the poor third is up , till death enlarge his confine .
then , world , thou hast a pair of chaps , no more , and throw between them all the food thou hast , they grind the one the other .
where antony ?
he walking in the garden thus , and spurns the rush that lies before him , cries , lepidus ! '
and threats the throat of that his officer that murder pompey .

octavius caesar house .
enter octavius caesar , agrippa , and mecaenas contemning rome , he has done all this , and more , in alexandria here the manner of i ' the , on a tribunal silver , cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold were publicly enthroned at the feet sat caesarion , whom they call my father son , and all the unlawful issue that their lust since then hath made between them .
unto her he gave the stablishment of egypt , made her of lower syria , cyprus , lydia , absolute queen .
this in the public eye ?
i ' the common , where they exercise .
his sons he there proclaim the kings of kings great media , parthia , and armenia .
he gave to alexander , to ptolemy he assign syria , cilicia , and phoenicia she in the habiliments of the goddess isis that day appear , and oft before gave audience , as is reported , so .
let rome be thus inform .
who , queasy with his insolence already , will their good thoughts call from him .
the people know it , and have now received his accusations .
who does he accuse ?
caesar and that , having in sicily sextus pompeius spoil , we had not rated him his part o ' the isle then does he say , he lent me some shipping unrestored lastly , he frets that lepidus of the triumvirate should be deposed , and , being , that we detain all his revenue .
sir , this should be answer .
is done already , and the messenger gone .
i have told him , lepidus was grown too cruel , that he his high authority abused , and did deserve his change for what i have conquer , i grant him part , but then , in his armenia , and other of his conquer kingdoms , i demand the like .
he never yield to that .
nor must not then be yielded to in this .
enter octavia with her train hail , caesar , and my lord !
hail , most dear caesar !
that ever i should call thee castaway !
you have not call me so , nor have you cause .
why have you upon us thus !
you come not like caesar sister the wife of antony should have an army for an usher , and the neighs of horse to tell of her approach long ere she did appear , the trees by the way should have borne men , and expectation fainted , longing for what it had not , nay , the dust should have ascended to the roof of heaven , raised by your populous troops but you are come a to rome , and have prevented the ostentation of our love , which , left unshown , is often left unloved , we should have met you by sea and land , supplying every stage with an augmented greeting .
good my lord , to come thus was i not constrain , but did on my free will .
my lord , mark antony , hearing that you prepared for war , acquainted my grieved ear withal , whereon , i begg his pardon for return .
which soon he granted , being an obstruct his lust and him .
do not say so , my lord .
i have eyes upon him , and his affairs come to me on the wind .
where is he now ?
my lord , in athens .
no , my most wronged sister , cleopatra hath nodded him to her .
he hath given his empire up to a whore , who now are levying the kings o ' the earth for war , he hath assembled bocchus , the king of libya , archelaus , of cappadocia , philadelphos , king of paphlagonia , the thracian king , adallas , king malchus of arabia , king of pont , herod of jewry , mithridates , king of comagene , polemon and amyntas , the kings of mede and lycaonia , with a more larger list of sceptres .
ay me , most wretched , that have my heart parted betwixt two friends that do afflict each other !
welcome hither your letters did withhold our breaking forth , till we perceived , both how you were wrong led , and we in negligent danger .
cheer your heart , be you not troubled with the time , which drives your content these strong necessities , but let determined things to destiny hold unbewail their way .
welcome to rome , nothing more dear to me .
you are abused beyond the mark of thought and the high gods , to do you justice , make them ministers of us and those that love you .
best of comfort , and ever welcome to us .
welcome , lady .
welcome , dear madam .
each heart in rome does love and pity you only the adulterous antony , most large in his abominations , turns you off , and gives his potent regiment to a trull , that noises it against us .
is it so , sir ?
most certain .
sister , welcome pray you , be ever known to patience my sister !
exeunt scene vii .
near actium .
mark antony camp .
enter cleopatra and domitius enobarbus i will be even with thee , doubt it not .
but why , why , why ?
thou hast forspoke my being in these wars , and it is not fit .
well , is it , is it ?
if not denounced against us , why should not we be there in person ?
aside well , i could reply if we should serve with horse and mares together , the horse were merely lost , the mares would bear a soldier and his horse .
what you say ?
your presence needs must puzzle antony , take from his heart , take from his brain , from time , what should not then be spared .
he is already traduced for levity , and is said in rome that photinus an eunuch and your maids manage this war .
sink rome , and their tongues rot that speak against us !
a charge we bear i ' the war , and , as the president of my kingdom , will appear there for a man .
speak not against it i will not stay behind .
nay , i have done .
here comes the emperor .
enter mark antony and canidius is it not strange , canidius , that from tarentum and brundusium he could so quickly cut the ionian sea , and take in toryne ?
you have heard o , sweet ?
celerity is never more admired than by the negligent .
a good rebuke , which might have well becomed the best of men , to taunt at slackness .
canidius , we will fight with him by sea .
by sea !
what else ?
why will my lord do so ?
for that he dares us .
so hath my lord dared him to single fight .
ay , and to wage this battle at pharsalia .
where caesar fought with pompey but these offers , which serve not for his vantage , be shakes off , and so should you .
your ships are not well mann , your mariners are muleters , reapers , people ingross by swift impress , in caesar fleet are those that often have pompey fought their ships are yare , yours , heavy no disgrace shall fall you for refusing him at sea , being prepared for land .
by sea , by sea .
most worthy sir , you therein throw away the absolute soldiership you have by land , distract your army , which doth most consist of footmen , leave unexecuted your own renowned knowledge , quite forego the way which promises assurance , and give up yourself merely to chance and hazard , from firm security .
i fight at sea .
i have sixty sails , caesar none better .
our overplus of shipping will we burn , and , with the rest , from the head of actium beat the approaching caesar .
but if we fail , we then can at land .
enter a messenger thy business ?
the news is true , my lord , he is descried , caesar has taken toryne .
can he be there in person ?
is impossible , strange that power should be .
canidius , our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land , and our twelve thousand horse .
we to our ship away , my thetis !
enter a soldier how now , worthy soldier ?
o noble emperor , do not fight by sea , trust not to rotten planks do you misdoubt this sword and these my wounds ?
let the egyptians and the phoenicians go , we have used to conquer , standing on the earth , and fighting foot to foot .
well , well away !
exeunt mark antony , queen cleopatra , and domitius enobarbus by hercules , i think i am i ' the right .
soldier , thou art but his whole action grows not in the power o so our leader led , and we are women men .
you keep by land the legions and the horse whole , do you not ?
marcus octavius , marcus justeius , publicola , and caelius , are for sea but we keep whole by land .
this speed of caesar carries beyond belief .
while he was yet in rome , his power went out in such distractions as beguiled all spies .
who his lieutenant , hear you ?
they say , one taurus .
well i know the man .
enter a messenger the emperor calls canidius .
with news the time with labour , and throes forth , each minute , some .

enter mark antony and domitius enobarbus set we our squadrons on yond side o ' the hill , in eye of caesar battle , from which place we may the number of the ships behold , and so proceed accordingly .
exeunt scene x .
another part of the plain .
canidius marcheth with his land army one way over the stage , and taurus , the lieutenant of octavius caesar , the other way .
after their going in , is heard the noise of a alarum .
enter domitius enobarbus naught , naught all , naught !
i can behold no longer the antoniad , the egyptian admiral , with all their sixty , fly and turn the rudder to mine eyes are blasted .
enter scarus gods and goddesses , all the whole synod of them !
what thy passion !
the greater cantle of the world is lost with very ignorance , we have kiss away kingdoms and provinces .
how appears the fight ?
on our side like the token pestilence , where death is sure .
yon ribaudred nag of egypt , whom leprosy ! i ' the midst o ' the fight , when vantage like a pair of twins appear , both as the same , or rather ours the elder , the breese upon her , like a cow in june , hoists sails and flies .
that i beheld mine eyes did sicken at the sight , and could not endure a further view .
she once being loof , the noble ruin of her magic , antony , claps on his , and , like a doting mallard , leaving the fight in height , flies after her i never saw an action of such shame , experience , manhood , honour , before did violate so itself .
alack , alack !
enter canidius our fortune on the sea is out of breath , and sinks most lamentably .
had our general been what he knew himself , it had gone well o , he has given example for our flight , most grossly , by his own !
ay , are you thereabouts ?
why , then , good night indeed .
toward peloponnesus are they fled .
is easy , and there i will attend what further comes .
to caesar will i render my legions and my horse six kings already show me the way of yielding .
i yet follow the wounded chance of antony , though my reason sits in the wind against me .

enter mark antony with attendants hark !
the land bids me tread no more upo , it is ashamed to bear me !
friends , come hither i am so lated in the world , that i have lost my way for ever i have a ship laden with gold , take that , divide it , fly , and make your peace with caesar .
fly !
not we .
i have fled myself , and have instructed cowards to run and show their shoulders .
friends , be gone , i have myself resolved upon a course which has no need of you , be gone my treasure in the harbour , take it .
o , i follow that i blush to look upon my very hairs do mutiny , for the white reprove the brown for rashness , and they them for fear and doting .
friends , be gone you shall have letters from me to some friends that will sweep your way for you .
pray you , look not sad , nor make replies of loathness take the hint which my despair proclaims , let that be left which leaves itself to the straightway i will possess you of that ship and treasure .
leave me , i pray , a little pray you now nay , do so , for , indeed , i have lost command , therefore i pray you i see you by and by .
sits down enter cleopatra led by charmian and iras , eros following nay , gentle madam , to him , comfort him .

do !
why what else ?
let me sit down .
o juno !
no , no , no , no , no .
see you here , sir ?
o fie , fie , fie !
madam !
madam , o good empress !
sir , sir , yes , my lord , yes , he at philippi kept his sword like a dancer , while i struck the lean and wrinkled cassius , and was i that the mad brutus ended he alone dealt on lieutenantry , and no practise had in the brave squares of war yet now no matter .
ah , stand by .
the queen , my lord , the queen .
go to him , madam , speak to him he is unqualitied with very shame .
well then , sustain him o !
most noble sir , arise , the queen approaches her head declined , and death will seize her , but your comfort makes the rescue .
i have offended reputation , a most unnoble swerving .
sir , the queen .
o , whither hast thou led me , egypt ?
see , how i convey my shame out of thine eyes by looking back what i have left behind in dishonour .
o my lord , my lord , forgive my fearful sails !
i little thought you would have follow .
egypt , thou too well my heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings , and thou shouldst tow me after my spirit thy full supremacy thou , and that thy beck might from the bidding of the gods command me .
o , my pardon !
now i must to the young man send humble treaties , dodge and palter in the shifts of lowness , who with half the bulk o ' the world play as i pleased , making and marring fortunes .
you did know how much you were my conqueror , and that my sword , made weak by my affection , would obey it on all cause .
pardon , pardon !
fall not a tear , i say , one of them rates all that is won and lost give me a kiss , even this repays me .
we sent our schoolmaster , is he come back ?
love , i am full of lead .
some wine , within there , and our viands !
fortune knows we scorn her most when most she offers blows .
exeunt scene xii .
egypt .
octavius caesar camp .
enter octavius caesar , dolabella , thyreus , with others let him appear that come from antony .
know you him ?
caesar , is his schoolmaster an argument that he is pluck , when hither he sends so poor a pinion off his wing , which had superfluous kings for messengers not many moons gone by .
enter euphronius , ambassador from mark antony approach , and speak .
such as i am , i come from antony i was of late as petty to his ends as is the on the to his grand sea .
so declare thine office .
lord of his fortunes he salutes thee , and requires to live in egypt which not granted , he lessens his requests , and to thee sues to let him breathe between the heavens and earth , a private man in athens this for him .
next , cleopatra does confess thy greatness , submits her to thy might , and of thee craves the circle of the ptolemies for her heirs , now hazarded to thy grace .
for antony , i have no ears to his request .
the queen of audience nor desire shall fail , so she from egypt drive her friend , or take his life there this if she perform , she shall not sue unheard .
so to them both .
fortune pursue thee !
bring him through the bands .
exit euphronius to thyreus from antony win cleopatra promise , and in our name , what she requires , add more , from thine invention , offers women are not in their best fortunes strong , but want will perjure the touch vestal try thy cunning , thyreus , make thine own edict for thy pains , which we will answer as a law .
caesar , i go .
observe how antony becomes his flaw , and what thou his very action speaks in every power that moves .
caesar , i shall .
exeunt scene xiii .
alexandria .
cleopatra palace .
enter cleopatra , domitius enobarbus , charmian , and iras what shall we do , enobarbus ?
think , and die .
is antony or we in fault for this ?
antony only , that would make his will lord of his reason .
what though you fled from that great face of war , whose several ranges frighted each other ?
why should he follow ?
the itch of his affection should not then have nick his captainship , at such a point , when half to half the world opposed , he being the meered question was a shame no less than was his loss , to course your flying flags , and leave his navy gazing .
prithee , peace .
enter mark antony with euphronius , the ambassador is that his answer ?
ay , my lord .
the queen shall then have courtesy , so she will yield us up .
he says so .
let her .
to the boy caesar send this grizzled head , and he will fill thy wishes to the brim with principalities .
that head , my lord ?
to him again tell him he wears the rose of youth upon him , from which the world should note something particular his coin , ships , legions , may be a coward , whose ministers would prevail under the service of a child as soon as i ' the command of caesar i dare him therefore to lay his gay comparisons apart , and answer me declined , sword against sword , ourselves alone .
i write it follow me .
exeunt mark antony and euphronius aside yes , like enough , caesar will unstate his happiness , and be staged to the show , against a sworder !
i see men judgments are a parcel of their fortunes , and things outward do draw the inward quality after them , to suffer all alike .
that he should dream , knowing all measures , the full caesar will answer his emptiness !
caesar , thou hast subdued his judgment too .
enter an attendant a messenger from caesar .
what , no more ceremony ?
see , my women !
against the blown rose may they stop their nose that kneel unto the buds .
admit him , sir .
exit attendant aside mine honesty and i begin to square .
the loyalty well held to fools does make our faith mere folly yet he that can endure to follow with allegiance a lord does conquer him that did his master conquer and earns a place i ' the story .
enter thyreus caesar will ?
hear it apart .
